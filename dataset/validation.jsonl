[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] Growing interest in superconducting quantum computing has recently motivated detailed measurement of several types of superconducting thin-film resonators at millikelvin temperatures. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] Unfortunately, non-ideal experimental setups can lead to an asymmetry in the resonance line shape, [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] corresponding to a rotation of the resonance circle, which complicates the interpretation of internal and external quality factors ($Q_i$ and $Q_e$). Several methods for extracting the $Q_i$ of a resonator exist for different experimental setups. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] However, these methods either require a single port reflective measurement [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (incompatible with most qubit measurements), full two-port data [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (typically unavailable for millikelvin measurements), or identifying and fitting to a second coupled mode [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (a special case). In contrast, the most widely used technique for analyzing millikelvin resonator measurements, the $\\phi$ rotation method ($\\phi$RM), simply adds an empirical rotation of the resonance circle to extract the quality factor. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n\nIn this article we show how asymmetry in the resonance line shape can arise from coupling the resonator to mismatched input and output transmission lines and non-negligible transmission line series inductance. Based on this understanding of the origin of the asymmetry, we derive the Diameter Correction Method (DCM), used in recent publications, [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and use it to extract $Q_i$. We compare this to the conventional analysis method, the $\\phi$ rotation method ($\\phi$RM) [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and show that there is a one-to-one mapping between the two methods but that the $\\phi$RM systematically overestimates $Q_i$ by an analytically quantifiable amount. Note, we will not address fitting techniques here because a comprehensive quantitative comparison of fitting techniques has been made.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n\n## Derivation of Asymmetric Resonance\nWe consider a notch type resonator coupled to input and output transmission lines (see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:schem)(a)) in which the transmission, $S_{21}\\equiv V_{out}/V_{in}$, is measured. Full transmission is measured off resonance and reduced transmission is measured on resonance. The resonator inductance and capacitance are $L$ and $\\hat C$ , where $\\hat C$ is complex to account for dielectric loss. $V_{in}$ and $V_{out}$ are the input and output voltage waves, and $V$ is the voltage across the capacitor, $\\hat C$. Ideally, the transmission line ports are matched ($Z_ {in}=Z_{out}=Z_0$), and $L_1$ is small ($L_1<<C_CZ_{in}^2$ and  $L_1<<C_CZ_{out}^2$). However, conditions such as a precise matching of $Z_ {in}$ and $Z_ {out}$ can prove to be difficult to achieve in an experimental setup.\n\nAssuming a high quality factor, $Q_i>>1$, the circuit in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:schem)(a) can be redrawn as Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:schem)(b), where $R=Q_i/\\left(\\omega_0 C\\right)$. Solving Kirchhoff's equations we find an expression for the transmission as a function of the voltage across the capacitor:\n$$\n\nS_{21}=\\left(1+\\hat{\\epsilon}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{V}{2V_{in}}\\left(\\frac{M}{L}+Z_{in}^\\prime i\\omega C_C\\right)\\right),\n\\label{eq:S21}\n\n$$\nwhere $1+\\hat{\\epsilon}\\equiv\\frac{2}{1+\\left(i\\omega C_C+\\frac{1}{Z_{out}}\\right)Z_{in}^\\prime}$, $Z_{in}^\\prime \\equiv Z_{in}+i\\omega L_1-i\\omega \\frac{M^2}{L}$, and $|\\hat{\\epsilon}|<<1$. Solving Kirchhoff's equations again and eliminating $V_{out}$ we get the independent equation:\n$$\n\n-V\\Biggl(\\frac{1}{i\\omega L}+i\\omega \\hat{C}+\\frac{i\\omega C_C}{i \\omega C_C Z_{out}+1}+\\\\\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{M}{L}-\\frac{i \\omega C_C Z_{out}}{1+i \\omega C_C Z_{out}}\\right)^2}{Z_{out}^\\prime+Z_{in}+i\\omega \\left(L_1-\\frac{M^2}{L}\\right)}\\Biggr)=\\\\\n2V_{in}\\left(\\frac{\\frac{M}{L}-\\frac{i \\omega C_C Z_{out}}{1+i \\omega C_C Z_{out}}}{Z_{out}^\\prime+Z_{in}+i\\omega \\left(L_1-\\frac{M^2}{L}\\right)}\\right),\n\\label{eq:Norton}\n\n$$\nwhere $Z_{out}^\\prime \\equiv \\frac{Z_{out}}{1+i\\omega C_CZ_{out}}$. Equation\u00a0(<ref>) is of the form $V\\left(\\frac{1}{i\\omega L} +i\\omega \\hat{C}+G_N\\right)=I_N$, where $G_N$ and $I_N$ are the Norton equivalent conductance and current respectively. The circuit thus has a Norton equivalent shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:schem)(c). From Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) we see that\n$$\n\nI_N=-2V_{in}\\left(\\frac{\\frac{M}{L}-\\frac{i \\omega C_C Z_{out}}{1+i \\omega C_C Z_{out}}}{Z_{out}^\\prime+Z_{in}+i\\omega \\left(L_1-\\frac{M^2}{L}\\right)}\\right),\n\\label{eq:In}\n\n$$\nand,\n$$\n\nG_N=\\frac{i\\omega C_C}{i \\omega C_C Z_{out}+1}+\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{M}{L}-\\frac{i \\omega C_C Z_{out}}{1+i \\omega C_C Z_{out}}\\right)^2}{Z_{out}^\\prime+Z_{in}+i\\omega \\left(L_1-\\frac{M^2}{L}\\right)}.\n\\label{eq:Gn}\n\n$$\nSince the real part of $G_N$ loads the resonator measurement and the imaginary part shifts the resonance frequency, it is useful to separate $G_ N$ into its real (conductive) and imaginary (susceptive) components. We define $\\mathbf{Re}\\{G_N\\} \\equiv 1/R_T$, $\\mathbf{Im}\\{G_N\\} \\equiv \\omega C_T$, $R _{eff} ^{-1} \\equiv R^{-1}+R_T^{-1}$, $Q \\equiv R_{eff}\\omega_0(C+C_T)$, and $G ^\\prime \\equiv -\\frac{I_N}{2V_{in}}\\left(\\frac{M}{L}+Z_{in}^\\prime i \\omega C_C\\right)$. Then, Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) can be rewritten as\n$$\n\nS_{21}=\\left(1+\\hat{\\epsilon}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{G ^\\prime R_{eff}}{1+2iQ\\frac{\\omega-\\omega_0}{\\omega_0}}\\right).\n\\label{eq:S21_G'}\n\n$$\n\nWe now note that to second-order in the small parameters $(M/L)$ and $\\omega C_C Z_{out}$, $G ^\\prime$ is equal to $R_T^{-1}$. Stopping at second-order would yield a resonance with a symmetric Lorentzian line shape. To expand to higher-order, we rewrite Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) as\n$$\n\nS_{21}=\\left(1+\\hat{\\epsilon}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\left(G_D+R_T^{-1}\\right) R_{eff}}{1+2iQ\\frac{\\omega-\\omega_0}{\\omega_0}}\\right),\n\\label{eq:S21_Gd}\n\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\nG_D \\equiv G^\\prime-R_T^{-1}\n%=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{M}{L}-i \\omega C_C Z_{out}^\\prime\\right)\\left(\\frac{M}{L}+Z_{in}^\\prime i\\omega C_C\\right)}{Z_{out}^\\prime+Z_{in}+i\\omega \\left(L_1-\\frac{M^2}{L}\\right)}\\\\\n%-Re\\left(\\frac{i\\omega C_C}{i \\omega C_C Z_{out}+1}+\n%\\frac{\\left(\\frac{M}{L}-\\frac{i \\omega C_C Z_{out}}{1+i \\omega C_C Z_{out}}\\right)^2}{Z_{out}^\\prime+Z_{in}+i\\omega \\left(L_1-\\frac{M^2}{L}\\right)}\\right).\n\\label{eq:Gd}\n\n$$\nExpanding to third-order we find:\n$$\n\nG_D=i\\omega C_C \\frac{M}{L}\\left(\\frac{Z_{in}-Z_{out}}{Z_{in}+Z_{out}}\\right)+\\\\\n\\frac{i}{\\left(Z_{in}+Z_{out}\\right)^2}\\Biggl(\\left(\\omega C_C\\right)^2Z_{out}^2\\left(L_1-C_CZ_{in}^2\\right)-\\\\\n\\left(\\frac M L\\right)^2\\left(L_1-C_CZ_{out}^2\\right)\\Biggr),\n\\label{eq:Gd_expand}\n\n$$\nand note that $G_D$ is purely imaginary. We now define\n$$\n\n\\hat{Q}_e^{-1} \\equiv \\frac{R_T^{-1}+G_D}{\\omega_0\\left(C+C_T\\right)},\n\\label{eq:Qe_complex}\n\n$$\nand recognize that for $C_T<<C$\n$$\n\nQ_i^{-1}=Q^{-1}-\\mathbf{Re}\\left\\{\\hat{Q}_e^{-1}\\right\\},\n\\label{eq:Qi}\n\n$$\nThus we find\n$$\n\nS_{21}=\\left(1+\\hat{\\epsilon}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{Q\\hat{Q}_e^{-1}}{1+2iQ\\frac{\\omega-\\omega_0}{\\omega_0}}\\right).\n\\label{eq:S21_complex_Qe}\n\n$$\n\nWe emphasize here that $G_D$ is the term that creates the asymmetry in the line shape or equivalently a rotation of the resonance circle around the off resonance point. If $G_D$ were zero then $\\hat{Q}_e^{-1}$ would be real, reducing Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) to a symmetric Lorentzian line shape. Equation\u00a0(<ref>) can be written as\n$$\n\nS_{21}=\\left(1+\\hat{\\epsilon}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{Q\\left|\\hat{Q}_e^{-1}\\right|e^{i\\phi}}{1+2iQ\\frac{\\omega-\\omega_0}{\\omega_0}}\\right),\n\\label{eq:S21_phi}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{Q}_e^{-1}$ is represented in terms of its magnitude and phase, $\\phi$. Another equivalent representation is\n$$\n\nS_{21}=\\left(1+\\hat{\\epsilon}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{\\frac{Q}{Q_e}\\left(1+2iQ\\frac{\\delta\\omega}{\\omega_0}\\right)}{1+2iQ\\frac{\\omega-\\omega_0}{\\omega_0}}\\right),\n\\label{eq:S21_delomega}\n\n$$\nwhere we have defined $1/Q_e \\equiv \\mathbf{Re}\\left\\{\\hat{Q}_e^{-1} \\right\\}$ and $\\delta \\omega$ is the difference between the resonance frequency and the new rotated in-phase point on the resonance circle, $\\omega_1$ (see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)). The form of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) can be understood by noting that $S_{21}$ is real when $\\omega=\\delta \\omega+\\omega_0$ (to within a phase rotation of $1+\\hat{\\epsilon}$).\n\nHere we stress that Eqs.\u00a0(<ref>-<ref>) are equivalent representations of the asymmetric line shape, each highlighting a different interpretation of the asymmetry. In Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) the asymmetry is quantified by $\\mathbf{Im}\\left\\{\\hat{Q}_e^{-1} \\right\\}$ and one can think of the asymmetry as coming from a complex loading of the resonator. In Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) the asymmetry is quantified by $\\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the rotation angle of the resonance circle around the off-resonance point (see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)). And finally in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) the asymmetry is quantified by $\\delta \\omega$, where $\\delta\\omega=\\omega_1-\\omega_0$ is the frequency shift of the in-phase point on the resonance circle from $\\omega_0$ to $\\omega_1$ (see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)). There of course exists a simple one-to-one mapping between the three notations:\n$$\n\n\\phi=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{Im}\\{\\hat{Q}_e^{-1}\\}}{\\mathbf{Re}\\{\\hat{Q}_e^{-1}\\}}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(2Q\\frac{\\delta\\omega}{\\omega_0}\\right).\n\\label{eq:mapping}\n\n$$\n\nOne method that has been used [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] to extract internal quality factors simply accounts for the asymmetry by adding an empirical $\\phi$ rotation and incorrectly substitutes $\\left|\\hat{Q}_e^{-1}\\right|$ for $Q_e^{-1}$ by defining\n$$\n\n\\frac{1}{Q_{i,\\ \\phi RM}}=\\frac{1}{Q}-\\left|\\frac1{\\hat{Q}_e}\\right|.\n\\label{eq:Qi_wrong}\n\n$$\nThis method accounts for the asymmetric line shape phenomenologically by adding the rotation, $\\phi$, without accounting for its origin and its impact on the interpretation of $Q_i$. It corresponds to rotating the resonance circle back an angle $\\phi$, thereby putting $\\omega_0$ on the in-phase axis. This is the $\\phi$ rotation method ($\\phi$RM), and the rotation of the $\\phi$RM can best be seen by examining the difference between Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(a) and Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(b)($\\bigtriangleup$). However, simply rotating the resonance circle by angle $\\phi$ does not take into account the fact that the asymmetry has also caused the circle to grow by a factor of $1/\\cos(\\phi)$, assuming the circle has been normalized to full transmission off resonance $(S_{21}(\\omega<<\\omega_0)=S_{21}(\\omega>>\\omega_0)=1)$. We have shown here that instead one has\n$$\n\n\\frac{1}{Q_{i,\\ DCM}}=\\frac{1}{Q}-\\frac{1}{Q_e}.\n\\label{eq:Qi_right}\n\n$$\nWe call this the Diameter Correction Method (DCM) because in addition to rotating the circle by the asymmetry angle, $\\phi$, it also corrects the diameter by accounting for the complex $Q_e$. This can be seen by examining the difference between Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(a) and Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(b)($\\square$). Another interpretation of this result is that the quantity that remains constant in the asymmetry transformation is not the diameter of the resonance circle, as the $\\phi$RM assumes, but rather the distance between the in-phase axis intercepts, shown in bold in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle). That invariant length is the diameter of the circle for a symmetric resonance and becomes a chord of the circle as asymmetry is added, but remains equal to $Q/Q_e$, while the diameter grows as $Q/|\\hat{Q}_e|$. The analytical discrepancy between the two methods can simply be determined by subtracting Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) from Eq.\u00a0(<ref>),\n$$\n\n\\frac{1}{Q_{i,\\ DCM}}-\\frac{1}{Q_{i,\\ \\phi RM}}=\\left|\\frac1{\\hat{Q}_e}\\right|\\left(\\cos(\\phi)-1\\right).\n\\label{eq:Qi_right_wrong_diff}\n\n$$\nFrom Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) we see that the error in the $\\phi$RM diverges for high asymmetry angle, $\\phi \\approx \\pm \\pi$, and for low $Q_e$, high coupling. Note that for $\\phi=0$, $\\hat{Q}_e^{-1}$ is real and Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) reduces to Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and therefore Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) goes to zero.\n\n## Fitting and Analyzing Simulations and Data\nTo test the $\\phi$RM and the DCM, we simulate the transmission using a numerical linear solver. Simulations are run varying several different parameters: $Q_i$, impedance mismatches, strength of both inductive and capacitive coupling and inductance of $L_1$. The resonator capacitance and inductance are held at 0.3 pF and 2.5 nH, respectively, producing a resonance frequency that ranges from 5.717-5.802 GHz (resonance frequency varies with coupling capacitance). The simulated data is then fit and analyzed using both methods.\n\nWe created asymmetry by varying $Z_{in}/Z_{out}$. Note that asymmetry can also be created by increasing $L_1$. However, $L_1$ values in the nanohenries are required to create significant asymmetry which is far too large to be physical. Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:lorent) shows results from simulations and fits with the same simulated quality factor, $Q_i=10^5$ and a range of $Z_{in}/Z_{out}$ values. The coupling line mismatch creates a clear asymmetry in the line shape which is quantified  with the extracted asymmetry angle, $\\phi$, also shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:lorent). In addition to the value of $\\phi$ extracted from the fit, we also analytically determine the asymmetry using\n$$\n\n\\phi=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{Im}\\{G_D\\}}{R_T^{-1}}\\right).\n\\label{eq:phi}\n\n$$\n\nTwo internal quality factors are extracted from these fits, one using the $\\phi$RM and the other using the DCM. In  Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_phi) both extracted quality factors as well as the fit extracted asymmetry angle $\\phi$ are plotted against the predicted $\\phi$ from Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). It is clear from Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_phi) that the DCM is more accurate as the asymmetry, $\\phi$, increases, and that the two methods agree  for small asymmetry.\n\nWe also compared both analysis techniques when asymmetry is held constant but $Q_i$ is varied, which we will show later corresponds to some experimental data sets. Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_sim) shows the fit extracted $Q_i$ from both analysis techniques as the actual simulation $Q_i$ is increased for two sets of simulations, one with low and one with high asymmetry. For low asymmetry (matched ports) both analysis techniques yield the correct $Q_i$ within the expected first-order error ($C_C/C$). However, for high asymmetry (mismatched ports), the $\\phi$RM yields quality factors that are systematically too high. For sufficiently high $Q_i$s, the $\\phi$RM yields negative $Q_i$s (this is why the asymmetric data analyzed by the $\\phi$RM appears to stop at large $Q_i$ in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_sim)). These unphysical, negative, $Q_i$s can best be understood by examining the circle plots in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle). As discussed earlier when there is a large asymmetry, in addition to being rotated, the resonance circle grows by a factor of $1/\\cos(\\phi)$ (assuming full transmission off resonance). Since the $\\phi$RM only rotates the circle back, it does not account for the increase in size, shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(b). So if $Q \\approx Q_e$ $(Q_i>>Q_e)$, the circle diameter is larger than 1, almost crossing the y-axis. Rotating the circle using the $\\phi$RM causes the circle to cross the y-axis and this yields a negative $Q_i$. In Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(b) the $\\phi$RM analyzed simulation almost crosses the origin. This corresponds to the $Q_i=8 \\times 10^5$ simulation in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_sim); it is an example of a simulation data set with a $Q_i$ and asymmetry not large enough to create a negative $Q_i$ but still large enough to create a considerable discrepancy between $Q_{i,\\ \\phi RM}$ and $Q_{i,\\ DCM}$.\n\nTo further evaluate both methods, we also analyzed data from a 5.75GHz coplanar aluminum resonator on sapphire, measured at 30 mK in a dilution refrigerator. Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:res)(a) shows a picture of this resonator and a more detailed description can be found in Ref.\u00a0Khalil2011. The resonator is measured by being mounted in a copper sample box and electrical connections are made with the Coplanar waveguide (CPW) using aluminum wire bonds. Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:res)(b) shows an example of the measured resonance line shape and its fit for one mounting of the resonator which exhibited a particularly high asymmetry, presumably due to the non-ideal mounting of the device in the sample box. In Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_data) we show the extracted $Q_i$ using both techniques and the extracted asymmetry angle, $\\phi$. The quality factor dependence on voltage is discussed in Ref.\u00a0Khalil2011. Here we focus on the difference between the two analysis techniques. Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_data) is very similar to the high asymmetry simulations in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_sim).  As expected from Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), the asymmetry, $\\phi$, is independent of $Q_i$ for both the real device measurements and the simulated data. Also the last two data points for the $\\phi$RM in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_data) are negative (and off the plot) in the same manner that the last points in the simulated data of Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_sim) are negative.\n\nAn additional way to test the analysis techniques is by varying $Q_e$ while keeping $Q_i$ constant. In Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qe), $Q_e$ is increased by lowering the capacitive coupling. As expected, for low asymmetry (matched ports) both analysis techniques do a good job of extracting $Q_i=10^5$. However, with high asymmetry (mismatched ports) the $\\phi$RM overestimates $Q_i$ by a decreasing amount as $Q_e/Q_i$ increases. Interestingly, in the $\\phi$RM, as $Q_e$ increases, the extracted $Q_i$ approaches the real value, although the asymmetry, $\\phi$, is increasing. This is because as $Q_e$ increases the $\\phi$RM is less sensitive to the asymmetry. This behavior is captured in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), which shows that as $Q_e$ increases, the difference between the two analysis methods vanishes. In fact for $Q_e>>Q_i$, the asymmetry becomes completely irrelevant and the two techniques converge.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn summary, we derived an analytical resonance line shape based on circuit parameters and found that for non-ideal conditions the line shape is asymmetric. We developed a technique (DCM) for extracting accurate internal quality factors from asymmetric resonator measurements using only transmission data. By analyzing simulated resonator measurements we found that the DCM is superior at extracting accurate internal quality factors to the conventional $\\phi$RM used in millikelvin resonator measurements. We found that in the limit where the asymmetry is low, the two methods agreed, but when the asymmetry is high, particularly when $Q_i>>Q_e$, the DCM accurately determines $Q_i$ while the $\\phi$RM systematically overestimates it. Also, for sufficiently high asymmetry and coupling the $\\phi$RM gives a negative $Q_i$. We have also shown that the two methods can produce different results on real data taken on a coplanar superconducting aluminum resonator with high asymmetry.\n\nWe wish to acknowledge S. Anlage, C. Lobb, and S. Gladchenko for helpful discussions.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Schematic of resonator measurement setup with both inductive and capacitive coupling and mismatched transmission lines.

Note that the fit is centered at the resonance frequency, but not at the minimum transmission frequency because those are not the same frequencies for asymmetric line shapes.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nData from a resonator identical to that shown in Fig. 6. (a) $Q_i$, extracted using both analysis techniques, $\\phi$RM ($\\blacktriangle$) and DCM ($\\blacksquare$), as a function of voltage across the resonator, $V_{RMS}$. As with simulated results in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_sim), the $\\phi$RM systematically extracts higher $Q_i$s with the highest $Q_i$s yielding negative results. The dashed line indicates the fit extracted external quality factor, $Q_e$. (b) The fit extracted asymmetry angle, $\\phi_{exp.}$ ($\\blacklozenge$), plotted against $V_{RMS}$. Again similar to the simulated results in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_sim), $\\phi_{exp.}$ is independent of the changing $Q_i$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) $Q_i$ extracted using both analysis techniques from two sets of simulations. One with high asymmetry (mismatched ports: $Z_{in}=24.5 \\Omega$, $Z _{out}=84.5\\Omega$) and one with low asymmetry (matched ports: $Z_{in}=Z_{out}=50\\Omega$) plotted against a varying $Q_e$. $Q_e$ is varied by varying the coupling capacitance (1-10 fF), with a constant mutual inductance (5 pH). The dashed line indicates the actual $Q_i$ of the simulations. With increasing $Q_e$ the inaccuracy of the $\\phi$RM is diluted due to the decreasing weight of $Q_e$ in the analysis. (b) The extracted asymmetry angles for the two simulations, low ($\\lozenge$) and high ($\\blacklozenge$) asymmetry.\n\n20\nfxundefined [1]\nifx#1\n\nfnum [1]\n#1firstoftwo\nsecondoftwo\n\nfx [1]\n#1firstoftwo\nsecondoftwo\n\nnoop [0]secondoftwo\n\nref[1]@startlink#1@href\nhref[1]#1@endlink\nanitize@url [0]`\n12`$12`&12`#12`1\u03022`_12`\nstartlink[1]\nendlink[0]\n\nrl [1]href #1\n\n@bib@innerbibempty\n\n[Day et\u00a0al.(2003)Day,\nLeDuc, Mazin, Vayonakis,  and Zmuidzinas]Day2003\nauthor author P.\u00a0K.

author: ]l.dicarlo@tudelft.nl\n\nWe introduce Cryoscope,  a method for sampling on-chip baseband pulses used to dynamically control qubit frequency in a quantum processor.\nWe specifically use Cryoscope to measure the step response of the dedicated flux control lines of two-junction transmon qubits in circuit QED processors with the temporal resolution of the room-temperature arbitrary waveform generator producing the control pulses.\nAs a first application, we iteratively improve this step response using optimized real-time digital filters to counter the linear-dynamical distortion in the control line,  as needed for high-fidelity,  repeatable one- and two-qubit gates based on dynamical control of qubit frequency.\n\nIn many solid-state quantum information platforms, accurate dynamical control of qubit frequency is key to realizing single- and two-qubit gates.\nCommon on-chip control variables include, but are not limited to, voltage on a local gate and magnetic flux through a SQUID loop.\nFor example, voltage control is typically used for spin qubits\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and gatemons[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], while flux control is ubiquitous for transmon, flux and fluxonium superconducting qubits\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nIn most cases, the input control signal originates at an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) operating at room temperature.\nThe signal suffers linear dynamical distortions as it traverses various electrical components on the control line connecting to the quantum device, most often lying at the coldest stage of a dilution refrigerator.\n\nIf uncompensated, such distortions can have detrimental effects on gate performance, affecting fidelity and even repeatablility.\nA salient example is the controlled-phase (CZ) gate between two transmon qubits implemented by a baseband flux pulse\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] that brings the computational state $\\ket{11}$ temporarily near resonance with the non-computational state $\\ket{02}$.\nShort-timescale distortions of the meticulously shaped flux pulse\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] can produce leakage away from the two-qubit computational subspace, leaving remnant population in $\\ket{02}$.\nMeanwhile, long-timescale distortions make the unitary action of a flux pulse depend on the history of flux pulses applied\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nAs leakage and history dependence severely limit the depth of quantum circuits that can be realized, a practical scheme for characterization and correction of pulse distortion on chip is of paramount importance.\n\nDistortions introduced by components at room temperature (e.g., AWG bandwidth, high-pass filtering of a bias tee, skin effect in instrumentation cable) are easily characterized with a fast oscilloscope.\nHowever, distortions introduced by components inside the refrigerator (e.g., low-pass filters, impedance mismatch, skin effect in semi-rigid coaxial cable, chip packaging\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]) are generally temperature-dependent and are thus best characterized in the cold.\nAdditionally, the on-chip response varies across devices and even between different qubits on the very same device.\nEvidently, the ideal strategy for characterizing pulse distortion is to use the controlled qubit itself.\n\nA traditional method to visualize the dynamical distortion of ideally square pulses is to observe the oscillations in the excited-state population (as a function of pulse amplitude and duration) when pulsing the qubit into near resonance with another exchange-coupled qubit or a continuous drive tone.\nWhile the distortions can be gleaned from the deviation from the ideal chevron pattern\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the inversion is challenging.\nMore direct methods use spectroscopy\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and Ramsey experiments\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] to measure the qubit frequency dynamics, but only during the turn-off transients following a square pulse.\nMost recently, a method combining continuous microwave and flux drives was developed to convert a transmon into a vector network analyzer\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] giving the frequency response of the flux control line,  from which it is possible to calculate the qubit frequency dynamics for a given pulse.\n\nIn this Letter, we present Cryoscope (short for cryogenic oscilloscope), an in-situ technique using the qubit to sample control pulses of arbitrary shape at the temporal resolution of the AWG.\nWe specifically demonstrate Cryoscope for two-junction transmon qubits, whose frequency depends quadratically (to a good approximation) on the flux through the constituent SQUID loop.\nHowever, Cryoscope is generally applicable to any system with quadratic or higher power dependence of qubit frequency on the control variable and a sweetspot where qubit frequency is at least first-order insensitive to this variable.\nAs a first application, we use Cryoscope to iteratively measure the voltage-to-flux step response and apply predistortion corrections to the control waveforms.\nWe predistort the waveforms digitally using finite- and infinite impulse response filters applied in real time, i.e., without precompilation of the waveform, in a manner compatible with codeword-based microarchitectures\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and feedback control.\nWe consistently find the reconstructed step response to be within $\\sim 0.1\\%$ of the ideal response in several setups and devices.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nBasic concept of Cryoscope.\n(a) Overview of relevant transformations involved.\n(b)    Schematic of the control line used to control the flux $\\PhiQ$ through the transmon SQUID loop. A DC source and AWG combined at a bias tee at room temperature produce the static and dynamic components of $\\PhiQ$.\n(c) When operating Cryoscope, the transmon is biased at its flux sweetspot and pulsed away only during the waiting interval between the $\\pi/2$ pulses in a standard Ramsey-style experiment.\n(d) The difference in quantum phase $\\Delta\\phaseQ$ [shown in (e)] acquired by the qubit during Ramsey experiments with the flux pulse truncated after $\\tTrunc$ and $\\tTrunc+\\Delta\\tTrunc$ provides an estimate of the instantaneous qubit detuning $\\detuning$ in the interval $[\\tTrunc, \\tTrunc+\\Delta\\tTrunc]$, and consequently an estimate $\\PhiR$ of the instantaneous actual flux $\\PhiQ$.\nThe nonlinear dependence of $\\detuning(\\PhiQ)$ suppresses the error produced by the difference of the two turn-off transients.\n(f) Reconstructed step response of the control line, normalized to maximal flux.\n\nThe transition frequency $\\freqQ$ of a two-junction transmon depends on the magnetic flux $\\PhiQ(t)$ through its SQUID loop and for symmetric junctions is given by\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:flux_to_freq}\n\\freqQ(\\PhiQ) \\approx \\frac{1}{h}\\left(\\sqrt{8\\Ej \\Ec \\!\\abs{\\cos{\\left(\\pi \\frac{\\PhiQ}{\\Phio}\\right)}}} -\\Ec\\right),\n\n$$\nwhere $\\Ec$ is the charging energy, $\\Ej$ is the sum of the Josephson energies of the individual junctions, $\\Phio$ is the flux quantum, and $h$ is Planck's constant.\nIn our system, the static and dynamic components of $\\PhiQ$ are produced by a DC source and an AWG, respectively, and combined at a bias tee, all at room temperature.\nHere, we use the DC source to null flux offsets, biasing the transmon at its maximal frequency, $\\freqQmax\\approx \\frac{1}{h} \\sqrt{8\\Ej\\Ec}-\\Ec$, which functions as a sweetspot with first-order insensitivity to $\\PhiQ$.\nAs in typical applications\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], we use the AWG to flux pulse the transmon to detunings $\\detuning(t)=\\freqQmax-\\freqQ(\\PhiQ(t))$ up to $\\sim 1~\\GHz$, corresponding to $\\sim 0.25\\Phio$.\n\nAt its core, Cryoscope is a technique using Ramsey-style experiments to obtain an estimate $\\PhiR(t)$ of the actual $\\PhiQ(t)$ produced by an AWG pulse $\\Vin(t)$.\nWe embed the flux pulse (with varying truncation of the input) between the two $\\pi/2$ pulses, which are always separated by a fixed interval $\\Tsep$.\nThe first $\\pi/2$ pulse (around the $y$ axis of the Bloch sphere) prepares the qubit in the superposition state $(\\ket{0}+\\ket{1})/\\sqrt{2}$.\nAn AWG pulse $\\VinTrunc(t)$ truncated at time $\\tTrunc$ produces a flux $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{Q}, \\tTrunc} (t)$ that transforms the state to $(\\ket{0}+e^{i\\phaseQ_\\tTrunc}\\ket{1})/\\sqrt{2}$, with relative quantum phase\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:cryoscope_phase_simple}\n\\phaseQ_\\tTrunc/2\\pi = \\int_0^{\\tTrunc}\\detuning(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{Q}, \\tTrunc} (t)) \\dd{t}+\\int_\\tTrunc^{\\Tsep}\\detuning(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{Q}, \\tTrunc} (t)) \\dd{t},\n\n$$\nwhere we explicitly separate the contributions from the flux response up to the truncation point and the subsequent turn-off transient.\nWe complete the Ramsey experiment with two variants, one with the final $\\pi/2$ rotation around $y$ and another with it around $x$ before measuring in order to determine the Bloch vector components $\\langle X\\rangle$ and $\\langle Y \\rangle$ from which we extract $\\phaseQ_\\tTrunc$.\n\nWe estimate $\\PhiQ(t)$ in the small time interval $[\\tTrunc, \\tTrunc+ \\Delta \\tTrunc]$ using the following procedure.\nFirst, we measure $\\phaseQ_\\tTrunc$ and $\\phaseQ_{\\tTrunc + \\Delta \\tTrunc}$ to compute\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:cryoscope_detuningEst}\n\\detuningEst \\equiv\n\\frac{\\phaseQ_{\\tTrunc+\\Delta\\tTrunc}-\\phaseQ_{\\tTrunc}}{2\\pi \\Delta\\tTrunc} =\\frac{1}{\\Delta\\tTrunc} \\int_\\tTrunc^{\\tTrunc+\\Delta\\tTrunc} \\detuning(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{Q}, \\tTrunc+\\Delta\\tTrunc}(t)) \\dd{t}+\\varepsilon,\n\n$$\nwhich gives the average detuning $\\detuningAvg$ during the interval, with inaccuracy\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:cryoscope_detuningEst_varepsilon}\n\\varepsilon =\\frac{1}{\\Delta\\tTrunc}\\left(\\int_{\\tTrunc+\\Delta \\tTrunc}^{\\Tsep} \\detuning(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{Q}, \\tTrunc+\\Delta\\tTrunc}(t)) \\dd{t}\n-  \\int_\\tTrunc^{\\Tsep} \\detuning(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{Q}, \\tTrunc}(t)) \\dd{t}\\right),\n\n$$\ngiven by the difference in the phase contributions of the turn-off transients.\n\nThe phase contribution from the turn-off transients is suppressed because of the steep return to the first-order flux-insensitive sweetspot of the nearly quadratic $\\detuning(\\PhiQ)$.\nNumerical simulations\nindicate that ${|\\varepsilon|}/{\\detuningEst} \\lesssim 10^{-2}$\u2013$10^{-3}$ for dynamical distortions of typically used components\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ][$\\tfrac{|\\varepsilon|}{\\detuningEst} $ can be slightly larger for certain idealized filters such as a single-pole low-pass filter.\n.].\nThis suppression of ${|\\varepsilon|}/{\\detuningEst}$ would improve for higher order of nonlinearity in $\\detuning(\\PhiQ)$.\n\nFinally, we obtain the reconstructed $\\PhiR(t)$ by inversion of <ref>.\nThe ability of Cryoscope to reconstruct pulses of arbitrary shape is shown in the Supplemental materials\nfor the case of a pulse shaped as a traditional Dutch canal skyline.\n\nWe briefly discuss some technical aspects of the implementation.\nWe set $\\Delta\\tTrunc=1/2.4~\\ns$, the minimum allowed by the sampling rate of the AWG (Zurich Instruments HDAWG).\nThe separation time $\\Tsep$ is set $100~\\ns$ longer than the largest chosen $\\tTrunc$ to negate the need for fine timing calibrations and to be less sensitive to  residual detuning during the final rotation.\nThe phase $\\phaseQ_\\tau$ is determined by combining the $\\langle X\\rangle$ and $\\langle Y \\rangle$ data.\nBefore unwrapping the phase it is demodulated using the highest frequency component of a Fourier transform of the $\\langle X\\rangle$ and $\\langle Y \\rangle$ data.\nA second-order Savitzky-Golay filter is then used to determine the derivative by fitting a polynomial in a small window around each data point.\nThe estimated detuning $\\detuningEst$ is a sum of the frequency extracted using the Savitzky-Golay filter, the demodulation frequency and, when using large flux pulse amplitudes, appropriate multiples of the $1.2~\\GHz$ Nyquist frequency.\nThe Nyquist order can be determined by acquiring Cryoscope traces for square pulses with different amplitudes and observing when the mean frequency wraps as the pulse amplitude is increased.\nBecause distortions can cause the instantaneous detuning to be slightly lower or higher than the mean detuning, amplitudes close to the Nyquist wrapping should be avoided.\n\nAs a first demonstration of Cryoscope, we measure the voltage-to-flux step response $\\step$ of the control line.\nThe result shown in <Ref>(f) reveals clear deviations from the ideal, with dynamics on timescales comparable to typical pulse durations ($\\sim 40~\\ns$) and much longer.\nThese dynamics are the result of compounded linear dynamical distortions and thus can be described by convolution of the input $\\Vin(t)=V_0 \\cdot \\heaviside$ (where $\\heaviside$ is the Heaviside step function) with the system impulse response $\\imp$, $\\PhiQ (t)=\\imp \\star \\Vin (t)$.\nWe furthermore assert that the system is causal so that $\\step = 0 $ for $t<0$.\n\nAs an application of Cryoscope, we make iterative use of real-time digital filtering (available in the AWG) and Cryoscope to improve the step response.\nThe goal of this procedure is to determine the filter $\\impFilt =\\impPseudoInv$ that best inverts $\\imp$ such that the corrected step response $\\stepCorr = \\impFilt \\star \\step$ approximates $\\heaviside$ as close as possible.\n\nFirst, several first-order infinite impulse response (IIR) filters are applied to eliminate dynamics on timescales longer than $30~\\ns$.\nThe IIR filters are designed to each correct a step response of the form $\\step = g(1+Ae^{-t/\\tIIR})\\cdot\\heaviside$, where $A$ is the amplitude coefficient, $\\tIIR$ is the time constant of the filter and $g$ is a gain constant.\nThe coefficients of the filters are determined by performing a least-squares optimization of a prediction of $\\stepCorr$ based on a model of the IIR filters and the measured $\\step$.\nBecause the IIR filters are applied in real-time on the hardware, there are small differences between the ideal filter and the implementation which are taken into account in the model.\nWe typically require 3\u20135 such IIR filters in order to correct $\\step$ between $30-200~\\ns$\nCryoscope is used to evaluate the corrections of the IIR filters\u00a0[<ref>(a)] and shows a reconstruction in which the slow dynamics are corrected to within $\\sim0.1\\%$.\n\nNext, a finite impulse response (FIR) filter is used to correct for the remaining short ($<30~\\ns$) timescale dynamics.\nThe FIR filter is described by 40 parameters that in turn describe the 72 coefficients ($30~\\ns$) of the filter.\nThe values are found by minimizing the distance between the predicted signal and the ideal step response using the CMA-ES algorithm\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nA third Cryoscope measurement is performed to test the accuracy of the corrections.\nThis final step can be used to iteratively fine tune the FIR coefficients if required.\nNo such iterations were required to achieve a reconstructed step response accurate to $\\sim0.1\\%$ shown in\u00a0<ref>(a).\n\nTo independently characterize the corrections, we perform a chevron experiment without and with the predistortions applied [<ref>(b,c)].\nIn this experiment, two qubits ($q_1$ and $q_0$) are prepared in the $\\ket{11}$ state using $\\pi$ pulses, a square flux pulse of varying duration and amplitude is applied to the higher frequency qubit ($q_0$) to tune $\\ket{11}$ into (near) resonance with $\\ket{02}$, the same interaction that is exploited to realize a CZ gate.\nWith no predistortions applied [<ref>(b)], the pattern of $q_1$ population as a function of pulse amplitude (horizontal axis) and duration (vertical axis) is visibly asymmetric \u2013 fringes on the right-hand side are more visible, and the pattern bends towards large pulse amplitudes for short pulse durations.\nThese two features are signatures of the finite rise time of the applied pulse.\nIn contrast, when predistortions are applied [<ref>(c)], the pattern is almost perfectly left-right symmetric, both in terms of visibility and shape, indicating a near-perfect rectangular pulse.\nUsing Cryoscope, we can predict the pulse amplitude that results in exact $\\ket{11}$\u2013$\\ket{02}$ degeneracy at every point in time.\nThe prediction [white curve in <ref>(b, c)] overlaps with the path along which the oscillations are slowest, providing an independent verification (although less quantitative) of our method.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nReconstructed step response without and with distortion corrections (for a qubit on a different device from that of <ref>) normalized to flux between 40 and $125~\\ns$.\n(a) Cryoscope measurements of uncorrected (orange) and corrected step responses with IIR corrections only (red) and FIR and IIR corrections (blue).\n(b-c) Chevron experiments without and with predistortion corrections (not corrected for readout error).\nThe overlaid curve indicates resonance between $\\ket{11}$ and $\\ket{02}$, predicted using the step response reconstructed with Cryoscope.\nSee text for details.\n\nHaving established the ability to measure and correct distortions, we investigate the sensitivity of Cryoscope.\n<Ref>(a) presents the unprocessed measurement of $\\langle X \\rangle$ for three values of qubit detuning during the rectangular pulse.\nIn all cases we observe decaying oscillations. The decay is faster the larger the pulse amplitude due to reduced coherence of the qubit further away from sweetspot.\nThe reconstructed instantaneous flux in a $100-200~\\ns$ window [<ref>(b,c)] fluctuates around the mean value, in a range decreasing with the amplitude of the rectangular pulse.\nWe interpret that for larger detuning the qubit precession is faster, resulting in a larger phase acquired between subsequent time steps and consequently yielding a more accurate measurement of the instantaneous detuning relative to nearly the same sampling noise.\n\nWe define a signal-to-noise ratio to quantify the influence of dephasing and precession rate on Cryoscope sensitivity,\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:SNR}\n\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{\\PhiRmn}{\\PhiRstd}.\n\n$$\nWe define as signal the mean amplitude of the optimally corrected, reconstructed flux $\\PhiRmn$ and as noise the standard deviation $\\PhiRstd$\nThe SNR is experimentally determined for several time windows and amplitudes of the rectangular flux pulse\u00a0[<ref>(d)].\nWe perform 10 Cryoscope experiments for every data point to extract $\\PhiRmn$ and $\\PhiRstd$ in the relevant time interval.\nIn the $100-200~\\ns$ window, SNR increases quadratically with pulse amplitude, indicating that detuning increases, while the qubit coherence is not affected on this short timescale.\nIn contrast, the increase of SNR is slower for the other time windows. In particular, for the $1200-1300~\\ns$ window, the SNR reaches a maximum for pulse amplitude $\\PhiQ \\approx 0.17~\\Phio$.\nThe maximum indicates the configuration in which the benefit of increased precession rate balances out the drawback of the reduced qubit coherence (due to increased sensitivity to flux noise).\n\nThe SNR is also affected by acquisition and processing parameters.\nThe former is the precision with which the qubit state can be determined, which depends on the number of averages and the readout fidelity.\nThe latter is a matter of applied data filtering and can be adjusted depending on the temporal resolution demanded.\n\nAll these factors can be combined in a model yielding\n$$\n\n\\SNR = \\aSNR \\PhiQ^2 \\exp \\left( -(\\Gamma_0 + 2 a \\Gamma_1 \\PhiQ) t \\right),\n\n$$\nwhere $t$ is the time of reconstruction, $\\aSNR$ accounts for sampling noise and filtering effects in data processing, $\\Gamma_0$ is a sweetspot dephasing rate, $\\Gamma_1$ quantifies the power of flux noise and the qubit detuning from sweetspot is $\\detuning (\\PhiQ) = a \\PhiQ^2$.\nThe interplay between quadratic and exponential terms in $\\PhiQ$ represents the trade-off between improved sensitivity to the shape of flux pulse versus reduced signal visibility due to dephasing.\nThe prefactor $\\aSNR$ can be increased by averaging more or alternatively improving the readout fidelity.\nWe fix values of $a$ and $\\Gamma_0$ based on independent measurements\nand perform a fit of the two-parameter model ($\\aSNR$ and $\\Gamma_1$), finding a good agreement with the data [<ref>(d)].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nCryoscope signal-to-noise ratio. (a) Raw measurements of $\\langle X \\rangle$ for individual Cryoscope traces using different detuning. (b, c) Zoom of reconstructed signal (normalized to the mean flux). The dotted curves denote deviations of 0.1\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a method capable of sampling on-chip flux pulses by exploiting the nonlinear flux dependence of transmon frequency.\nThis characterization method is straightforward to use and generalizable to any qubit system with baseband control of the qubit frequency and a sweetspot with respect to the control variable.\nFurthermore, we have demonstrated the capability to correct distortions as demonstrated by a reconstructed step response accurate to $\\sim0.1\\%$.\nThe identified corrections were applied in real time, making the correction method compatible with an instruction-based control architecture\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nCryoscope has already been used to tune-up fast, high-fidelity, and low-leakage CZ gates for a QEC experiment\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and parametrized iSWAP interactions in a variational quantum eigensolver\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS\n\nThe supplemental material provides

material for ``Time-domain characterization and correction of on-chip distortion of control pulses in a quantum processor''}\n\nThis supplement provides experimental details and derivations supporting claims made in the main text.\nFirst, we describe the experimental setup.\nWe then discuss the limitations of the Cryoscope, showing how undesired distortions are suppressed for a typical step response and how the  nonlinear response of the qubit to flux helps in reconstructing the step response.\nThe third section details a simple model that describes the signal-to-noise ratio of the experiment.\nNext, we provide details on the hardware implementations of the FIR and IIR filters used to correct distortions in real time.\nFinally, we provide experimental data demonstrating the ability to use Cryoscope to reconstruct an arbitrary signal.\n\n\\section{Device and experimental setup}\nThe data shown in this letter were acquired using two devices mounted in different dilution refrigerators.\nIn all experiments, a Zurich Instruments HDAWG equipped with real-time digital filters was used to generate the flux pulses.\nThe output of the AWG was connected to the RF port of a Mini-Circuits ZFBT 6GW+ bias tee while the DC port was connected to a DC current source.\nThe RF+DC port of the bias tee was connected to the flux control line entering the fridge.\nThe flux control line contains a $20\u00a0$ attenuator at the $4\u00a0$ stage as well as a Mini-Circuits VLFX1050 low-pass filter and a homebuilt eccosorb filter before being connected to the flux control line on the device.\nThe control-line coaxial cables between $4\u00a0$ and mixing chamber plate were superconducting (NbTi, inner and outer conductor) for one device and stainless steel (inner and outer) for the other.\nIn all cases it was possible to correct distortions to within $\u223c0.1\n`&12`#12`1\u03022`_12`\nstartlink[1]\nendlink[0]\n\nrl [1]href #1\n\n@bib@innerbibempty\n\n[Sagastizabal

An eight-qubit unit cell forms the basis for repeating  both the quantum hardware and coherent control, enabling spatial multiplexing. This control  uses three fixed frequencies for all single-qubit gates and a unique frequency detuning pattern for each qubit in the cell. By pipelining the interaction and readout steps of ancilla-based $X$- and $Z$-type stabilizer measurements, we can engineer detuning patterns that avoid all second-order transmon-transmon interactions except those exploited in controlled-phase gates, regardless of fabric size. Our scheme is applicable to defect-based and planar logical qubits, including lattice surgery.\n\n## Introduction\nThe scaling of small quantum processors\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] into large qubit arrays capable of fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC)\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is an outstanding challenge for leading experimental quantum information platforms\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Modular\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and monolithic\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] approaches require a systems approach that simultaneously and compatibly addresses challenges in all layers of the quantum computer stack\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]: from the quantum hardware at the low level, through classical control electronics in the middle, to software at the high level (i.e., micro-instruction sets, compilers, and high-level programming languages).\n\nCurrently, the surface code\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] provides an experimentally attractive paradigm for FTQC owing to its modest requirements on the quantum hardware: only nearest-neighbor coupling is needed between qubits, and the error threshold falls robustly close to $1\\%$ across a range of error models and error-decoding strategies, signficantly higher than those of Steane and Shor codes\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In superconducting quantum integrated circuits based on circuit QED (cQED)\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the error rate of single-qubit gates has reached $<0.1\\%$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], while those of  two-qubit conditional-phase ($\\CZ$) gates and measurement are $0.6\\%$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and $\\sim 1\\%$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], respectively.\n\nThe scalability of monolithic systems hinges on the ability to copy-paste a unit cell in the quantum plane, with suitable quantum interconnect between cells, and suitable classical interconnect to and from  the control plane. The latter pursuit is very active, with several groups developing\nvertical (rather than the traditional lateral) interconnection of input/output (I/O) signals using through-the-wafer coaxial lines\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], electro-mechanical sockets\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and bump-bonding in flip-chip configuration\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nFor true scalability, it is crucial that the unit cell also extend into the classical control plane. A unit cell for control signals opens the door to hardware simplification through spatial multiplexing, i.e., the selective routing of control signals (with minimal customization) to spatially separated components. While frequency-division multiplexing is already heavily exploited in cQED\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], spatial multiplexing is in its infancy.  Precision control of same-frequency qubits using a microwave-frequency vector switch matrix (VSM) for pulse multicasting has only recently been demonstrated\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn this paper, we propose a scalable scheme for the QEC cycle of a monolithic superconducting surface code by defining a concrete unit cell for both the quantum hardware and the control signals. We focus on a fabric of fast-flux-tunable transmon qubits interacting with nearest neighbors via flux-controlled conditional-phase $(\\CZf)$ gates\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] realized by pulsing into the resonator-mediated $\\ket{11} \\leftrightarrow \\ket{02}$ avoided crossing of the interacting transmon pair (numbers indicate excitation level). Our approach is compatible with adiabatic\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], sudden\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and fast-adiabatic\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] use of these crossings.  Our eight-qubit unit cell uses three fixed frequencies for all single-qubit control and eight detuning sequences for two-qubit gates. This approach to classical control allows significant control hardware savings via spatial multiplexing. By pipelining the measurement of the two types of stabilizers of the surface code, we engineer detuning patterns avoiding all second-order transmon-transmon interactions except those exploited in $\\CZf$ gates, regardless of fabric size. Our scheme allows changing the weight of stabilizer measurements by simple on/off masking of detuning pulses, making it applicable to both defect-based and planar logical qubits\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], including lattice surgery\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n## Background\n### Surface code QEC cycle\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nLayout of a surface-code fabric.  Red circles with $D$ labels represent data qubits. Blue (green) circles with $X$ ($Z$) labels represent ancillas performing $X$-type ($Z$-type) quantum parity checks of their nearest-neighbor data qubits. Each check is realized as an indirect quantum measurement, consisting of a coherent step involving pairwise interactions (dashed lines) followed by ancilla measurement. The delineated fabric of nine data qubits ($\\Da$ through $\\Di$) and eight ancillas ($\\Xa$ through $\\Xd$ and $\\Za$ through $\\Zd$) constitutes the distance-3 planar logical qubit named Surface-17.\n\nA surface-code fabric consists of the two-dimensional square lattice of data-carrying qubits shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Large_SC). The stabilizers of this code are the $X$-type ($Z$-type) parity operators $\\prod_i X_i$ $\\left(\\prod_i Z_i \\right)$, where $i$ denotes data qubits on the corners of the blue (green) plaquettes. Conventionally, these stabilizers are measured indirectly using ancilla qubits positioned at the center of the plaquettes, forming a second square lattice. Standard circuits for measuring $X$- and $Z$-type stabilizers, shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Plaquettes), combine a sequence of coherent interactions of the ancilla with its nearest-neighbor data qubits, followed by projective ancilla measurement.\n\nUsing controlled-not ($\\CX$) gates as the fundamental interaction,  $X$-type and $Z$-type stabilizer measurements can be fully parallelized with circuit depth seven. We define circuit depth as the number of operations on each ancilla per QEC cycle, counting in measurement but excluding ancilla initialization [we assume Pauli frame updating (PFU)\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is used for data and ancilla qubits]. The order of two-qubit gates in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Plaquettes) is important for two reasons\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. First,\ndata qubits common to adjacent plaquettes must do all their interactions with one ancilla before the other. Second, the S (N) pattern for $X$-type ($Z$-type) stabilizers provides resilience to single ancilla-qubit errors even in small distance-three surface codes such as Surface-17. This circuit consists of the patch delineated in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Large_SC), with nine data qubits (labelled $\\Da$ to $\\Di$), four ancillas ($\\Xa$ to $\\Xd$) for $X$-type stabilizer measurements, and four ancillas\n($\\Za$ to $\\Zd$) for $Z$-type stabilizer measurements.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n$X$-type (a) and $Z$-type (b) plaquettes. Data qubits are labelled according to their position relative to the ancilla (NE=northeast, NW=northwest, SE=southeast, and SW=southwest). Standard circuits for measuring $X$-type (c, e) and $Z$-type (d, f) stabilizers indirectly using ancillas, using  $\\CX$ (c, d) or $\\CZ$ (e, f) as the primitive data-ancilla interaction. The order of two-qubit gates, NE-NW-SE-SW (NE-SE-NW-SW) for $X$-type ($Z$-type), ensures that all data qubits common to  adjacent plaquettes do their interactions with one ancilla before the other, and also provides resilience to ancilla errors in Surface-17\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Using the relations $H=Y_{+90}Z=ZY_{-90}$, one can see that the opening and closing $H$ gates can be replaced by $Y_{-90}$ and $Y_{+90}$ rotations, respectively.\n\nWhen the two-qubit gate is $\\CZ$, parallelizing the stabilizer measurements of Surface-17 requires depth nine because of non-commutation between Hadamard $(H)$ gates and $\\CZ$ gates. The full circuit for the parallelized QEC cycle of Surface-17 using $\\CZ$ gates is shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Parallelized). Using gate and measurement times from recent experiments  ($\\toneq=20~\\ns$ for single-qubit gates, $\\ttwoq=40~\\ns$ for $\\CZf$ gates, and $500~\\ns$ for ancilla readout and photon depletion in readout resonator), the QEC cycle will complete in $740~\\ns$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDepth-nine quantum circuit for parallelized $X$- and $Z$-stabilizer measurements in Surface-17 using $\\CZ$ gates. The six $\\CZ$ gates inside each gray box are executed simultaneously. Typical values  of gate and readout times are indicated at the top. The bottom arrow represents the looping of QEC cycles. Qubits are labelled as in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Large_SC).\n\nLimitations of fully parallelized $X$- and $Z$-type stabilizer measurements using $\\CZf$ gates\n\nOn paper, it is straightforward to compose a depth-nine quantum circuit for the fully parallelized QEC cycle of a surface-code fabric of arbitrary size. However, to the best of our knowledge following numerous failed  attempts, the full parallelization of $X$- and $Z$-type stabilizer measurements makes it impossible to realize a scalable implementation with $\\CZf$ gates that satisfies all of the following desirable properties:\n\n* Microwave pulses for single-qubit gates should be applied at a fixed, small number of frequencies.\n\n* Transmons should maximally exploit their coherence sweetspot\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n* Flux-pulsed transmons should not cross any other interaction zones on their way to or from the intended\n$\\ket{11} \\leftrightarrow \\ket{02}$ avoided crossings realizing the $\\CZf$ gate.\n\n* The flux-pulsing schemes should be extensible to a surface code of arbitrary size using a fixed number of detuning sequences and a fixed detuning range.\n\n* The implementation should be compatible with logical qubit operations.\n\nWe have found frequency arrangements and flux-pulse sequences that meet the first three criteria.\nHowever, all of these solutions require a growing number of detuning sequences and detuning ranges as the fabric expands, in order to avert all other interactions on the way to and from the $\\ket{11} \\leftrightarrow \\ket{02}$ avoided crossings of $\\CZf$ gates. Furthermore, these solutions seem practically infeasible already for distance five (Surface-49\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]). To our knowledge, no fully parallel solution exists with a fixed number of detuning sequences and a fixed detuning range. In the next section, we introduce a pipelined (rather than parallelized) version of the QEC cycle that simultaneously meets the five desirable properties for a fabric of arbitrary size.\n\n## The pipelined QEC cycle\nOur scalable scheme, which we term pipelined QEC cycle, combines four key elements:\n\nA. Repeating unit cells of eight qubits;\n\nB. Pipelined $X$- and $Z$-type stabilizer measurements;\n\nC. Three frequencies for single-qubit control;\n\nD. Eight detuning sequences implementing the requisite $\\CZf$ gates, realizable by on/off masking of three flux-pulse primitives.\n\nWe now introduce these elements in detail.\n\n### Unit cell\nThe first element is a unit cell (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:SC_layout)) from which a surface code of arbitrary size can be assembled by repetition (and truncation at boundaries). A unit cell contains four data qubits ($\\Done$ to $\\Dfour$) and four ancillas ($\\Xone$, $\\Xtwo$, $\\Zone$, and $\\Ztwo$). Crucially, the cell is the fundamental unit of repetition not just for the quantum hardware. It is also the unit of repetition for all coherent control.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nComposing the surface-code fabric by repetition of 8-qubit unit cells. Red and pink circles represent data qubits,  blue (green) circles represent ancillas for $X$-type ($Z$-type) stabilizer measurements, and dashed lines represent nearest-neighbor couplings. Dot colors also indicate the frequency for single-qubit microwave control (red for $\\Fone$, greed and blue for $\\Ftwo$, and pink for $\\Fthree$). Contours delineate unit cells (with qubits named $\\Done$ to $\\Dfour$, $\\Xone$, $\\Zone$, $\\Xtwo$, and $\\Ztwo$).\n\nPipelining of $X$-type and $Z$-type stabilizer measurements\n\nThe second element is the pipelined execution of the $X$- and $Z$-type stabilizer measurements. The pipelining concept is illustrated in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Pipelined)(a). While stabilizer measurements of one type always run simultaneously, the coherent and readout steps of ancillas of the other type are interleaved. In other words, ancillas of one type undergo coherent steps while ancillas of the other type are measured. Time slots A and B (D and E) are for single-qubit gates pertinent to the  $X$-type ($Z$-type) stabilizer measurements, while slots 1 to 4 (5 to 8) are for two-qubit gates. Note that nine of the $\\CZ$ gates involve two qubits within the cell, while fourteen involve one qubit from a neighboring unit cell.\n\nGenerally, ancilla measurement (including any photon depletion of the readout resonator) will take longer than the coherent steps, leaving\ntime to perform operations on the data qubits in steps C and F while all ancillas are measured. Possible operations include logical gate operations, refocusing pulses, or single-qubit gates performing error correction. Clearly, performing such operations during steps C or F would not increase the QEC cycle time.\n\nPipelining offers several advantages. First, it compresses the stabilizer measurements to depth seven, two single-qubit-gate steps less than fully-parallelized quantum circuits (such as Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Parallelized) for Surface-17). A second and more crucial advantage is the ability to scale without increasing the number of frequencies for single-qubit control or qubit detuning sequences, as explained next.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Unit cell quantum circuit for pipelined $X$- and $Z$-type stabilizer measurements. Qubits are labelled as in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:SC_layout). Time slots 1 to 4 (5 to 8) are for $X$-type ($Z$-type) stabilizer $\\CZ$ gates. Time slots A and B (D and E) are for $X$-type ($Z$-type) stabilizer single-qubit gates. Time slots C and F allow (optional) operations on data qubits while $X$-ancillas ($Z$-ancillas) are measured during time slots D through F (time slots A through C). The bottom arrow indicates the repetition of QEC cycles. Elements in transparent gray belong to the previous or next QEC cycle. (b) Frequency arrangement and detuning sequences for qubits in the unit cell: single-qubit gates on $\\Done$ and $\\Dtwo$ ($\\Dthree$ and $\\Dfour$) are performed at $\\Fone$ ($\\Fthree$), while those on ancillas are performed at $\\Ftwo$. Ancilla measurements are performed at $\\FtwoP$. $\\CZf$ gates are performed between qubits at $\\FoneI$ and $\\Ftwo$ or at $\\FtwoI$ and $\\Fthree$. No interactions take place at $\\Fone$ or the parking frequencies $\\FtwoP$ and $\\FthreeP$. Small offsets are added to some detuning sequences to clarify the distinction between sequences for $\\Done$ and $\\Dtwo$, $\\Xone$ and $\\Xtwo$, $\\Zone$ and $\\Ztwo$, and $\\Dthree$ and $\\Dfour$.\n\n### Single-qubit control and detuning sequences\nThe third and fourth elements are best described together. Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:Pipelined)(b) presents our choice of frequencies for single-qubit control and the qubit-specific detuning sequences for realizing the two-qubit QEC cycle interactions. Single-qubit gates on data qubits (steps A, B, D, and E) are performed at frequencies $\\Fone$ and $\\Fthree$ (alternating in data-qubit rows), while those on ancillas are performed at intermediate frequency $\\Ftwo$. Note that with only nearest-neighbor coupling, two distinct frequencies (one for ancilla qubits and one for data qubits) reduce the exchange coupling between same-frequency qubits to fourth order (qubit-resonators, resonator-qubit, qubit-resonator, resonator-qubit). When extending to the proposed three frequencies, this also allows engineering the detuning sequences so that no transmon crosses any other second-order interaction zone on the way to or from the $\\ket{11} \\leftrightarrow \\ket{02}$ avoided crossings exploited in the $\\CZf$ gates.\n\nDuring steps 1-4 and 5-8, transmons are flux pulsed to a discrete set of frequencies, depending on whether they interact, idle, or are measured: $\\Done$ and $\\Dtwo$ to $\\Fone$ or $\\FoneI$; ancillas to $\\Ftwo$, $\\FtwoP$ or $\\FtwoI$; and $\\Dthree$ and $\\Dfour$ to $\\Fthree$ or $\\FthreeP$. $\\CZ$ gates occur between transmons at $\\FoneI \\approx \\Ftwo-\\anh$ and $\\Ftwo$, and between transmons at $\\FtwoI \\approx \\Fthree-\\anh$ and $\\Fthree$. Here, $\\anh \\sim -300~\\MHz$ is the transmon anharmonicity\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Transmons at $\\Fone$, $\\FtwoP$, and $\\FthreeP$ are hidden away and do not interact.\n\n### Constructing detuning sequences by masking of primitive flux pulses\nThe frequency detuning patterns during interaction steps 1 through 4 and 5 through 8 can be synthesized by on/off masking of three flux-pulse primitives using a switch matrix:\nA first primitive detuning data qubits of type $\\Done$ and $\\Dtwo$ from $\\Fone$ to $\\FoneI$, a second one detuning ancillas from $\\Ftwo$ to $\\FtwoI$, and a third one detuning data qubits of type  $\\Dthree$ and $\\Dfour$ from $\\Fthree$ to $\\FthreeP$. For example, the detuning sequence for $\\Dtwo$ in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Pipelined)(b) can be synthesized by masking the pulse primitive on (off) at steps 1, 4, 6, and 7 (2, 3, 5, and 8).\n\n## Compatibility with logical qubit operations\nTwo types of logical qubits can be envisioned for surface code: defect-based\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and planar\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Defect-based logical qubits are introduced by stopping the measurement of one or two stabilizers ($X$-type for rough logical qubits, and $Z$-type for smooth ones\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]). In our scheme, turning stabilizer measurements fully off can be accomplished in either of two ways. One is to mask off the $H$ gates of the corresponding ancilla using the VSM, without changing the detuning sequence or stopping the ancilla measurement. If the ancilla is in $\\ket{0}$, all its $\\CZf$ gates are inactive and there is no net action on the logical qubit. If it starts in $\\ket{1}$, the stabilizer operator (not its measurement) is applied. This performs a logical $\\XL$ $(\\ZL)$ gate on a rough (smooth) qubit. The ancilla measurements provide the key input allowing the decoder to keep track of the action by PFU. A second way to turn a stabilizer fully off is to mask off all the flux-pulse primitives in the interaction step.\n\nLogical operations, such as move and braiding operations on defect-based qubits\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and lattice surgery on planar ones\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], also require dynamically changing the weight of specific stabilizer measurements, i.e., selectively removing specific data qubits from the quantum parity checks. In our scheme, this can easily be achieved by selective on/off masking of flux-pulse primitives. For example, removing a qubit of type $\\Dtwo$ from the $X$-type stabilizer measurement below it simply requires masking off the pulse primitive at step 1. The order of the two-qubit gates can also be changed by masking.\n\n## Implementation details and variations\n### Choosing the frequencies\nIdeally, $\\Fone$ ($\\Fthree$) would match the sweetspot frequency of $\\Done$ and $\\Dtwo$ ($\\Dthree$ and $\\Dfour$), and $\\Ftwo$ would match that of all ancillas, to minimize dephasing from $1/f$ flux noise. In practice, $\\Fone$ would be set to the lowest sweetspot frequency among all transmons labelled $\\Done$ or $\\Dtwo$, and so on. It is straightforward to expand the circuit of Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Pipelined)(a) with refocusing single-qubit gates to minimize dephasing in the transmons that are not at their sweetspot during single-qubit control\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe frequencies $\\Fone$, $\\Ftwo$, $\\Fthree$, $\\FtwoP$, and $\\FthreeP$ must be chosen so that residual interactions during single-qubit gates can be tolerated.\nFor simplicity, we consider a uniform detuning scale $\\DF = \\Fone-\\FoneI=\\Ftwo-\\FtwoP=\\FtwoP-\\FtwoI=\\Fthree-\\FthreeP$. The single-qubit gate error is\n$\\varepsilon \\sim \\left(\\frac{\\xi^2}{4\\pi\\DF}\\toneq\\right)^2$, where $\\xi$ is the $\\ket{11} \\leftrightarrow \\ket{02}$ coupling strength\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For fast-adiabatic $\\CZf$ gates, $\\ttwoq\\approx 2\\frac{\\pi}{\\xi}$. Thus, $\\varepsilon\\sim~10^{-2}\\ (10^{-3})$ for $\\toneq=20~\\ns$ and $\\ttwoq=40~\\ns$ requires $\\DF \\sim 400~\\MHz\\ (1.2~\\GHz)$.\n\n### Frequency arrangement variations\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nAlternative frequency arrangement for qubits in the unit cell, with ancillas $\\Xone$ and $\\Zone$ ($\\Xtwo$ and $\\Ztwo$) at the outer frequency $\\Fone$ ($\\Fthree$) and data qubits at the inner frequency $\\Ftwo$.\n\nThere exist other possible frequency arrangements than that shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Pipelined)(b). For example, consider the inverted arrangement with all\ndata qubits at $\\Ftwo$ and the ancillas at the outer frequencies. Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:Ancilla_out) shows one of these configurations, with $\\Xone$ and $\\Zone$ ($\\Xtwo$ and $\\Ztwo$) at $\\Fone$ ($\\Fthree$). It is straightforward to modify the detuning sequences for this arrangement to also avert all unwanted interactions. However, upon comparing this alternative to the original arrangement, we observe a key difference making the original preferable for a cQED implementation with flux-tuneable transmons. Specifically, the original exactly balances the number of interaction steps in which qubits can remain at their upper frequency (i.e., at or closest to their coherence sweetspot), while the flipped arrangement allows this on just two (out of eight) steps for data qubits and zero or four (out of four) steps for ancilla qubits. The reduced data-qubit dephasing during the coherent steps will lead to a lower logical error rate. Note that this advantage of the original arrangement is made possible by lowering the ancillas to $\\FtwoP$ for their measurement, at which the additional dephasing is innocuous in view of the measurement-induced projection.\n\nResidual single-qubit gate cross-talk between $\\Done$ and $\\Dtwo$ ($\\Dthree$ and $\\Dfour$) can be reduced by breaking the degeneracy in frequency $\\Fone$ ($\\Fthree$), which requires increasing the number of primitive pulses from three to five, or even in $\\Ftwo$, further increasing the number of primitive pulses to eight.\n\n### Switch matrix\nA digitally addressable switch matrix and primitive-flux-pulse-synthesizer operating at room temperature (cryogenically) are exciting challenges for the near (long) term. The switch matrix should allow qubit-specific customization of the flux-pulse primitives, including fine adjustment of delay (to compensate cable-length mismatch), amplitude (for fine tuning of two-qubit and single-qubit phase), and dc offset (for tuning to $\\Fone$, $\\Ftwo$ and $\\Fthree$).\n\n## Conclusion and outlook\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic of the targeted realization of Surface-17 in a planar cQED architecture with vertical I/O. Every transmon (represented by a circle) has dedicated flux control line, microwave-drive line, and readout resonator. Dedicated bus resonators mediate interactions between nearest-neighbor data and ancilla qubits. Readout resonators are simultaneously interrogated using frequency-division multiplexing in diagonally-running feedlines. The central dashed square corresponds to the scanning electron micrograph in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Implementation)(a).  Note that a similar cQED chip design is envisioned in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Our scheme reduces the number of feedlines by bridging these over bus resonators.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nScanning electron micrographs of the key components of our cQED implementation of surface-code fabric: (a) starmon\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], (b) transmission-line crossover\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and (c) vertical I/O\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. (a) Starmon is a seven-port transmon connecting to four bus resonators (corners), one readout resonator (bottom), one microwave-drive line (top), and one flux-bias line (right). The ports in this image correspond directly to those in the dashed square in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:CQEDS17). (b) Transmission-line crossovers bridge readout feedlines over bus resonators. (c) Vertical coaxial lines couple all input and output signals.\n\nWe have presented a concrete scheme for the QEC cycle of an arbitary-size surface code implemented with flux-tuneable transmons. The scheme combines four key concepts: an eight-qubit unit cell as the basis  for repetition of  quantum hardware and control signals; pipelining of $X$- and $Z$-type stabilizer measurements; a fixed set of three frequencies for single-qubit control; and a fixed set of eight detuning sequences implementing the requisite controlled-phase gates. These eight detuning sequences can be composed by on-off masking of three flux-pulse primitives.\n\nExperimental efforts are underway to implement and evaluate the pipelined QEC cycle in Surface-17. We pursue a realization of the Surface-17 quantum hardware with transmons in a planar cQED architecture\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] made extensible using vertical interconnect for all input and output signals (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:CQEDS17)).  Each transmon will have a dedicated flux line\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] allowing control of its transition frequency on nanosecond timescales, a dedicated microwave-drive line, and a dedicated dispersively-coupled resonator for readout. We opt for coupling nearest-neighbor data and ancilla transmons via bus resonators (rather than direct capacitance\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]). Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:Implementation)(a) shows a prototype seven-port transmon developed in our lab, nicknamed starmon\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The vertical I/O will be realised either using through-silicon-vias [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Implementation)(c)] or bump bonding in a flip-chip arrangement.\n\nExperimental efforts are also underway to demonstrate the scalability of the classical control plane. Diagonally running feedlines coupled to readout resonators will allow simultaneous readout by frequency-division multiplexing\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], reducing the need for cryogenic amplifiers and microwave electronics (circulators, etc.), as well as homodyne detection systems at room temperature. While frequency multiplexing for readout is common in cQED, the simultaneous readout of nine qubits using one feedline as required by Surface-17 is not yet achieved. Finally, demonstrating the control-hardware savings achievable by spatial multiplexing is an immediate priority. Single-qubit control at $\\Fone$, $\\Ftwo$ and $\\Fthree$ will make use of a next-generation VSM (follow-up to\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]) to independently route precision DRAG\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] pulses to same-frequency qubits, with significant savings in microwave sources. Finally, a switch matrix for constructing frequency detuning sequences by on/off masking of flux-pulse primitives is envisioned for room temperature. A cryogenic implementation remains highly attractive for the longer term.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank C.\u00a0C.

Over the past twenty years, the field has matured from a predominantly basic research endeavor to one that increasingly explores the engineering of larger-scale superconducting quantum systems. Here, we review several foundational elements \u2013  qubit design, noise properties, qubit control, and readout techniques \u2013 developed during this period, bridging fundamental concepts in circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) and contemporary, state-of-the-art applications in gate-model quantum computation.\n\n## Introduction\nQuantum processors harness the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanical systems \u2013 such as quantum parallelism and quantum interference \u2013 to solve certain problems where classical computers fall short\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Over the past two decades, rapid developments in the science and engineering of quantum systems have advanced the frontier in quantum computation, from the realm of scientific explorations on single isolated quantum systems toward the creation and manipulation of multi-qubit processors\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In particular, the requirements imposed by larger quantum processors have shifted of mindset within the community, from solely scientific discovery to the development of new, foundational engineering abstractions associated with the design, control, and readout of multi-qubit quantum systems. The result is the emergence of a new discipline termed quantum engineering, which serves to bridge the basic sciences, mathematics, and computer science with fields generally associated with traditional engineering.\n\nOne prominent platform for constructing a multi-qubit quantum processor involves superconducting qubits, in which information is stored in the quantum degrees of freedom of nanofabricated, anharmonic oscillators constructed from superconducting circuit elements. In contrast to other platforms, e.g. electron spins in silicon\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and quantum dots[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], trapped ions[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], ultracold atoms[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], nitrogen-vacancies in diamonds[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and polarized photons[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where the quantum information is encoded in natural microscopic quantum systems, superconducting qubits are macroscopic in size and lithographically defined.\n\nOne remarkable feature of superconducting qubits is that their energy-level spectra are governed by circuit element parameters and thus are configurable; they can be designed to exhibit \u201catom-like\u201d energy spectra with desired properties. Therefore, superconducting qubits are also often referred to as artificial atoms, offering a rich parameter space of possible qubit properties and operation regimes, with predictable performance in terms of transition frequencies, anharmonicity, and complexity.\n\nWhile there are many other excellent reviews on superconducting qubits, see e.g. Refs. Devoret2004,You2005b,Schoelkopf2008,Clarke2008,Girvin2009,You2011,Oliver2013,Gambetta2017,Wendin2017,Gu2017, this work specifically aims to introduce new quantum engineers (academic and industrial alike) to the terminology and state-of-the-art practices used in the rapidly accelerating field of superconducting quantum computing. The reader is assumed to be familiar with basic concepts that span classical physics, quantum mechanics, and electrical engineering. In particular, readers will find it useful to have had previous exposure to classical mechanics, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the Bloch sphere representation of qubit states, second quantization, basic concepts of superconductivity, electromagnetism, introductory circuit analysis, classical boolean logic, linear dynamical systems, analog and digital signal processing, and familiarity with microwave components such as transmission lines and mixers. These topics will be introduced as they arise, but having basic prior knowledge will be helpful.\n\n### Organization of this article\nThis review is organized in the following four sections; first, in Sec. <ref>, we explore the parameter space available when designing superconducting circuits. In particular, we look at the promising capacitively-shunted planar qubit modalities and how these can be engineered with desired properties, such as transition frequency, anharmonicity, and reduced susceptibility to various sources of noise. In this section, we also introduce several ways in which interactions between qubits can be engineered, in order to implement two-qubit entangling operations, needed for a universal gate set.\n\nIn Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we discuss systematic and stochastic noise, the concepts of noise strength and qubit noise susceptibility, and the common sources of noise which lead to decoherence in superconducting circuits. We introduce the Bloch-Redfield model of decoherence, characterized by longitudinal and transverse relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$, and discuss the implications of $1/f$ noise. We then define the noise power spectral density, which is commonly used to characterize noise processes, and describe how it drives decoherence. Finally, we close the section with a review of coherent control methods used to mitigate certain types of coherence, reversible noise.\n\nIn Sec. <ref>, we provide a review of how single- and two-qubit operations are typically implemented in superconducing circuits, by using a combination of local magnetic flux control and microwave drives. In particular, we discuss the family of two-qubit gates arising from a capacitive coupling between qubits, and introduce several recent advances that have been demonstrated to achieve high-fidelity gates, as well as applications in quantum information processing that use these gates. The continued development of high-fidelity two-qubit gates in superconducting qubits is a highly active research area. For this reason, we include sufficient technical details that a reader may use this review as a starting point to critically assess the pros and cons of the various gates, as well as develop an appreciation for the types of gate-engineering already implemented in state-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors.\n\nFinally, in Sec. <ref>, we discuss the physics and engineering associated with the dispersive readout technique, typically used to measure the individual qubit states in modern quantum processors. After a discussion of the theory behind dispersive coupling, we give an introduction to design of Purcell filters and the development of quantum-limited parametric amplifiers.\n\nENGINEERING QUANTUM CIRCUITS\n\nIn this section, we will demonstrate how quantum systems based on superconducting circuits can be engineered to achieve certain desired properties. Using the most common qubit modalities, we discuss how properties such as the qubit transition frequency, anharmonicity, and noise susceptibility can be tailored by the choice of circuit topology and element parameter values. We also discuss how to engineer the interactions between different quantum systems, in particular the cases of qubit-qubit and qubit-resonator couplings.\n\nFrom quantum harmonic oscillator to the transmon qubit\n\nA quantum mechanical system is governed by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\n$$\n\n\\hat{H} \\vert \\psi(t) \\rangle = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\vert \\psi(t) \\rangle,\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\vert \\psi(t) \\rangle$ is the state of the quantum system at time $t$, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant $h/2\\pi$, and $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian that describes the total energy of the system. The \u201chat\" is used to indicate that $\\hat{H}$ is a quantum operator. As the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a first-order linear differential equation, the temporal dynamics of the quantum system may be viewed as a straightforward example of a linear dynamical system with formal solution,\n\n$$\n\n\\vert \\psi(t) \\rangle = e^{-i \\hat{H} t / \\hbar} \\vert \\psi(0) \\rangle.\n\n$$\n\nThe time-independent Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ governs the time evolution of the system through the operator $e^{-i \\hat{H} t / \\hbar}$. Thus, just as with classical systems, determining the Hamiltonian of a system \u2013 whether the classical Hamiltonian $H$ or its quantum counterpart $\\hat{H}$ \u2013 is the first step to deriving its dynamical behavior. In Sec. <ref>, we consider the case when the Hamiltonian is time-dependent in the context of qubit control.\n\nTo understand the dynamics of a superconducting qubit circuit, it is natural to start with the classical description of a linear LC resonant circuit [Fig. <ref>(a)]. In this system, energy oscillates between electrical energy in the capacitor $C$ and magnetic energy in the inductor $L$. In the following, we will arbitrarily associate the electrical energy with the \u201ckinetic energy\u201d and the magnetic energy with the \u201cpotential energy\u201d of the oscillator. The instantaneous, time-dependent energy in each element is derived from its current and voltage,\n\n$$\n\nE(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} V(t')I(t')dt',\n\\label{Eq:ElementEnergy}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $V(t')$ and $I(t')$ denote the voltage and current of the capacitor or inductor.\n\nTo derive the classical Hamiltonian, we follow the standard approach used in classical mechanics: the Lagrange-Hamilton formulation. Here, we represent the circuit elements in terms of one of its generalized circuit coordinates, charge or flux. In the following, we pick flux, defined as the time integral of the voltage\n\n$$\n\n\\Phi(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} V(t')dt'.\n\\label{Eq:NodeFlux}\n\n$$\n\nIn this example, the voltage at the node is also the branch voltage across the element. In this section, we will simply refer to these as node voltages and fluxes for convenience. For a more detailed discussion of nodes and branches in this context, we refer the reader to Ref.\u00a0Devoret1997.\n\nNote that in the following, we could have exchanged our associations with kinetic energy (momentum coordinate) and potential energy (position coordinate), and instead start with the charge variable $Q(t)$, which is the time integral of the current $I(t)$.\n\nBy combining Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>), using the relations $V=L \\; dI/dt$ and $I=C \\; dV/dt$, and applying the integration by parts formula, we can write down energy terms for the capacitor and inductor in terms of the node flux,\n\n$$\n\n\\mathcal{T}_C = \\frac{1}{2}C\\dot{\\Phi}^2,\n\\label{Eq:KineticEnergy}\n\n$$\n\n$$\n\n\\mathcal{U}_L = \\frac{1}{2L}\\Phi^2.\n\\label{Eq:PotentialEnergy}\n\n$$\n\nThe Lagrangian is defined as the difference between the kinetic and potential energy terms and can thus be expressed in terms of Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>)\n\n$$\n\n\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{T}_{C} - \\mathcal{U}_L = \\frac{1}{2}C\\dot{\\Phi}^2 - \\frac{1}{2L}\\Phi^2.\n\\label{Eq:Lagrangian}\n\n$$\n\nFrom the Lagrangian in Eq. (<ref>), we can further derive the Hamiltonian using the Legendre transformation, for which we need to calculate the momentum conjugate to the flux, which in this case is the charge on the capacitor\n\n$$\n\nQ = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{\\Phi}} = C\\dot{\\Phi}.\n\n$$\n\nThe Hamiltonian of the system is now defined as\n\n$$\n\nH = Q\\dot{\\Phi} - \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{Q^2}{2C} + \\frac{\\Phi^2}{2L} \\equiv\n\\frac{1}{2} C V^2 + \\frac{1}{2} L I^2,\n\\label{Eq:HamiltonianLC}\n\n$$\n\nas one would expect for an electrical LC circuit. Note that this Hamiltonian is analogous to that of a mechanical harmonic oscillator, with mass $m = C$, and resonant frequency $\\omega = 1/\\sqrt{LC}$, which expressed in position, $x$, and momentum, $p$, coordinates takes the form $H = p^2/2m + m\\omega^2 x^2/2$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian described above is classical. In order to proceed to a quantum-mechanical description of the system, we need to promote the charge and flux coordinates to quantum operators. And, whereas the classical coordinates satisfy the Poisson bracket:\n\n$$\n\n\\{f,g\\}\n&= \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta \\Phi} \\frac{\\delta g}{\\delta Q} - \\frac{\\delta g}{\\delta \\Phi} \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta Q} \\\\\n\\rightarrow \\{\\Phi,Q\\}  &= \\frac{\\delta \\Phi}{\\delta \\Phi} \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta Q} - \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta \\Phi} \\frac{\\delta \\Phi}{\\delta Q} = 1-0 = 1,\n\n$$\n\nthe quantum operators similarly satisfy a commutation relation:\n\n$$\n\n[\\hat{\\Phi},\\hat{Q}] = \\hat{\\Phi}\\hat{Q} - \\hat{Q}\\hat{\\Phi} = i\\hbar,\n\\label{Eq:CommutationRelationPhiq}\n\n$$\n\nwhere the operators are indicated by hats. From this point forward, however, the hats on operators will be omitted for simplicity.\n\nIn a simple LC resonant circuit [Fig. <ref>(a)], both the inductor $L$ and the capacitor $C$ are linear circuit elements. Defining the reduced flux $\\phi \\equiv 2 \\pi \\Phi / \\Phi_0$ and the reduced charge $n=Q/2e$, we can write down the following quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian for the circuit,\n\n$$\n\nH = 4E_C n^2 + \\frac{1}{2}E_L \\phi^2,\n\\label{Eq:Hqho}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $E_C = e^2/(2C)$ is the charging energy required to add each electron of the Cooper-pair to the island and $E_L = (\\Phi_0/2\\pi)^2/L$ is the inductive energy, where $\\Phi_0 = h/(2e)$ is the superconducting magnetic flux quantum. Moreover, the quantum operator $n$ is the excess number of Cooper-pairs on the island, and $\\phi$ \u2013 the reduced flux \u2013 is denoted the \u201cgauge-invariant phase\u201d across the inductor. These two operators form a canonical conjugate pair, obeying the commutation relation $[\\phi,n] = i$. We note that the factor 4 in front of the charging energy $E_C$ is solely a historical artifact, namely, that this energy scale was first defined for single-electron systems and then adopted to two-electron Cooper-pair systems.\n\nThe Hamiltonian in Eq.$\\,$(<ref>) is identical to the one describing a particle in a one-dimensional quadratic potential, a quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). We can treat $\\phi$ as the generalized position coordinate, so that the first term is the kinetic energy and the second term is the potential energy. We emphasize that the functional form of the potential energy influences the eigensolutions. For example, the fact that this term is quadratic ($U_L \\propto \\phi^2$) in Eq. (<ref>) gives rise to the shape of the potential in Fig. <ref>(b). The solution to this eigenvalue problem gives an infinite series of eigenstates $|k\\rangle$, ($k = 0,1,2,\\ldots$), whose corresponding eigenenergies $E_k$ are all equidistantly spaced, i.e. $E_{k+1} - E_k = \\hbar \\omega_r$, where $\\omega_r = \\sqrt{8 E_L E_C}/\\hbar = 1/\\sqrt{L C}$ denotes the resonant frequency of the system, see Fig. <ref>(b). We may represent these results in a more compact form (second quantization) for the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) Hamiltonian\n\n$$\n\nH = \\hbar\\omega_{r}\\left( a^{\\dagger}a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right),\n\\label{Eq:HqhoSQ}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $a^{\\dagger}(a)$ is the creation (annihilation) operator of a single excitation of the resonator. The Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) is written as an energy. It is, however, often preferred to divide by $\\hbar$ so that the expression has units of radian frequency, since we will later resonantly drive transitions at a particular frequency or reference the rate at which two systems interact with one another. Therefore, from here on, $\\hbar$ will be omitted.\n\nThe original charge number and phase operators can be expressed as $n = n_{\\text{zpf}}\\times i(a - a^{\\dagger})$ and $\\phi = \\phi_{\\text{zpf}} \\times (a + a^{\\dagger})$, where $n_{\\text{zpf}} = [E_L/(32E_C)]^{1/4}$ and $\\phi_{\\text{zpf}} = (2E_C/E_L)^{1/4}$ are the zero-point fluctuations of the charge and phase variables, respectively. Quantum mechanically, the quantum states are represented as wavefunctions that are generally distributed over a range of values of $n$ and $\\phi$ and, consequently, the wavefunctions have non-zero standard deviations. Such wavefunction distributions are referred to as \u201cquantum fluctuations,\u201d and they exist, even in the ground state, where they are called \u201czero-point fluctuations\u201d.\n\nThe linear characteristics of the QHO has a natural limitation in its applications for processing quantum information. Before the system can be used as a qubit, we need to be able to define a computational subspace consisting of only two energy states (usually the two-lowest energy eigenstates) in between which transitions can be driven without also exciting other levels in the system. Since many gate operations, such as single-qubit gates (Sec. <ref>), depend on frequency selectivity, the equidistant level-spacing of the QHO, illustrated in Fig. <ref>(b), poses a practical limitation[Even though linear resonant systems cannot be addressed properly, their long coherence times have proven them useful as quantum access memories for storing quantum information, where a nonlinear ancilla system is used as a quantum controller for feeding and extracting excitations to/from the resonant cavity modes[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Circuit for a parallel LC-oscillator (quantum harmonic oscillator, QHO), with inductance $L$ in parallel with capacitance, $C$. The superconducting phase on the island is denoted $\\phi$, referencing ground as zero. (b) Energy potential for the QHO, where energy levels are equidistantly spaced $\\hbar \\omega_{r}$ apart. (c) Josephson qubit circuit, where the nonlinear inductance $L_J$ (represented with the Josephson-subcircuit in the dashed orange box) is shunted by a capacitance, $C_s$. (d) The Josephson inductance reshapes the quadratic energy potential (dashed red) into sinusoidal (solid blue), which yields non-equidistant energy levels. This allows us to isolate the two lowest energy levels $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, forming a computational subspace with an energy separation $\\hbar\\omega_{01}$, which is different than $\\hbar\\omega_{12}$.\n\nTo mitigate the problem of unwanted dynamics involving non-computational states, we need to add anharmonicity (or nonlinearity) into our system. In short, we require the transition frequencies $\\omega_{\\text{q}}^{0\\rightarrow 1}$ and $\\omega_{\\text{q}}^{1\\rightarrow 2}$ be sufficiently different to be individually adressable. In general, the larger the anharmonicity the better. In practise, the amount of anharmonicity sets a limit on how short the pulses used to drive the qubit can be. This is discussed in detail in Sec. <ref>.\n\nTo introduce the nonlinearity required to modify the harmonic potential, we use the Josephson junction \u2013 a nonlinear, dissipationless circuit element that forms the backbone in superconducting circuits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. By replacing the linear inductor of the QHO with a Josephson junction, playing the role of a nonlinear inductor, we can modify the functional form of the potential energy. The potential energy of the Josephson junction can be derived from Eq. (<ref>) and the two Josephson relations\n\n$$\n\nI = I_c \\sin (\\phi), \\hspace{0.5cm}V = \\frac{\\hbar}{2e} \\frac{d\\phi}{dt},\n\\label{Eq:JosephsonRelations}\n\n$$\n\nresulting in a modified Hamiltonian\n\n$$\n\nH = 4E_C n^2 - E_J \\cos(\\phi),\n\\label{Eq:HTransmon}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $E_C = e^2/(2C_{\\Sigma})$, $C_{\\Sigma} = C_s + C_J$ is the total capacitance, including both shunt capacitance $C_s$ and the self-capacitance of the junction $C_J$, and $E_J = I_c \\Phi_0/2\\pi$ is the Josephson energy, with $I_c$ being the critical current of the junction[The critical current is the maximum supercurrent that the junction can support before it switches to the resistive state with non-zero voltage.]. After introducing the Josephson junction in the circuit, the potential energy no longer takes a manifestly parabolic form (from which the harmonic spectrum originates), but rather features a cosinusoidal form, see the second term in Eq. (<ref>), which makes the energy spectrum non-degenerate. Therefore, the Josephson junction is the key ingredient that makes the oscillator anharmonic and thus allows us to identify a uniquely addressable quantum two-level system, see Fig. <ref>(d).\n\nOnce the nonlinearity has been added, the system dynamics is governed by the dominant energy in Eq. (<ref>), reflected in the $E_J/E_C$ ratio. Over time, the superconducting qubit community has converged towards circuit designs with $E_J \\gg E_C$. In the opposite case when $E_J \\leq E_C$, the qubit becomes highly sensitive to charge noise, which has proven more challenging to mitigate than flux noise, making it very hard to achieve high coherence. Another motivation is that current technologies allow for more flexibility in engineering the inductive (or potential) part of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, working in the $E_J \\leq E_C$ limit, makes the system more sensitive to the change in the potential Hamiltonian. Therefore, we will focus here on the state-of-the-art qubit modalities that fall in the regime $E_J \\gg E_C$. For readers who are interested in the physics in the $E_J \\leq E_C$ regime, such as the earlier Cooper-pair box charge qubit, we refer to Refs. Nakamura1999,Vion2002,You2003,Duty2004.\n\nTo access the $E_J \\gg E_C$ regime, one preferred approach is to make the charging $E_C$ small by shunting the junction with a large capacitor, $C_s \\gg C_J$, effectively making the qubit less sensitive to charge noise \u2013 a circuit commonly known as the transmon qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In this limit, the superconducting phase $\\phi$ is a good quantum number, i.e. the spread (or quantum fluctuation) of $\\phi$ values represented by the quantum wavefunction is small. The low-energy eigenstates are therefore, to a good approximation, localized states in the potential well, see Fig. <ref>(d). We may gain more insight by expanding the potential term of Eq. (<ref>) into a power series (since $\\phi$ is small), that is\n\n$$\n\nE_J \\cos(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2}E_J \\phi^2 - \\frac{1}{24}E_J \\phi^4 + \\mathcal{O}(\\phi^6).\n\\label{Eq:EJexpansion}\n\n$$\n\nThe leading quadratic term in Eq. (<ref>) alone will result in a QHO, recall Eq. (<ref>). The second term, however, is quartic which modifies the eigensolution and disrupts the otherwise harmonic energy structure. Note that, the negative coefficient of the quartic term indicates that the anharmonicity $\\alpha = \\omega_{\\text{q}}^{1\\rightarrow 2} - \\omega_{\\text{q}}^{0\\rightarrow 1}$ is negative and its limit in magnitude thus cannot be made arbitrarily large. For the case of the transmon, $\\alpha = - E_C$ is usually designed to be $100 - 300\\,$MHz, as required to maintain a desirable qubit frequency $\\freq = (\\sqrt{8 E_J E_C} - E_C)/\\hbar = 3-6\\,$GHz, while keeping an energy ratio sufficiently large ($E_J/E_C \\geq 50$) to suppress charge sensitivity[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Fortunately, the charge sensitivity is exponentially suppressed for increased $E_J/E_C$, while the reduction in anharmonicity only scales as a weak power law, leading to a workable device.\n\nIncluding terms up to fourth order and using the QHO eigenbases, the system Hamiltonian resembles that of a Duffing oscillator\n\n$$\n\nH = \\freq a^{\\dagger}a + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}a^{\\dagger}a^{\\dagger}aa.\n\\label{Eq:HDuffing}\n\n$$\n\nSince $|\\alpha| \\ll \\freq$, we can see that the transmon qubit is basically a weakly anharmonic oscillator (AHO). If excitation to higher non-computational states is suppressed over any gate operations, either due to a large enough  $|\\alpha|$ or due to robust control techniques such as the DRAG pulse, see Sec. <ref>, we may effectively treat the AHO as a quantum two-level system, simplifying the Hamiltonian to\n\n$$\n\nH = \\freq \\frac{\\sigma_{z}}{2},\n\\label{Eq:HTwoLevelSystem}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma_{z}$ is the Pauli-z operator. However, one should always keep in mind that the higher levels physically exist[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Their influence on system dynamics should be taken into account when designing the system and its control processes. In fact, there are many cases where the higher levels have proven useful to implement more efficient gate operations[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn addition to reducing the charge dispersion, the use of a large shunt capacitor also enables us to engineer the electric field distribution of the quantum system, and thus the participation of surface loss mechanisms. In the development of the 3D transmon[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], e.g. a 2D transmon coupled to a 3D cavity, it was demonstrated that by making the gap between the two lateral capacitor plates large (compared to the film thickness) the coherence time increases since a smaller portion of the electric field interacts with the lossy interfaces, e.g. metal-substrate and substrate-vacuum interfaces, which has been studied extensively[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nModular qubit circuit representations for capacitively shunted qubit modalities (orange box Fig. <ref>c) and corresponding qubit transition frequencies for the two lowest energy states as a function of applied magnetic flux in units of $\\Phi_0$.

[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. (g-h) C-shunted fluxonium qubit, where the small junction is inductively shunted with a large array of $N$ junctions.\n\nQubit Hamiltonian engineering\n\n#### Tunable qubit: split transmon\nTo implement fast gate operations with high-fidelity, as needed to implement quantum logic, many (though not all[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]) of the quantum processor architectures implemented today feature tunable qubit frequencies[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For instance, in some cases, we need to bring two qubits into resonance to exchange (swap) energy, while we also need the capability of separating them during idling periods to minimize their interactions. To do this, we need an external parameter which allows us to access one of the degrees of freedom of the system in a controllable fashion.\n\nOne widely-used technique is to replace the single Josephson junction with a loop interupted by two identical junctions \u2013 forming a dc superconducting quantum interference device (dc-SQUID)[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Due to the interference between the two arms of the SQUID, the effective critical current of the two parallel junctions can be decreased by applying a magnetic flux threading the loop, see Fig. <ref>(a). Due to the fluxoid quantization condition, the algebraic sum of branch flux of all of the inductive elements along the loop plus the externally applied flux equal an integer number of superconducting flux quanta, that is\n\n$$\n\n\\varphi_1 - \\varphi_2 + 2\\varphi_{e} = 2\\pi k,\n\\label{Eq:FluxoidQuantization}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\varphi_{e} = \\pi \\Phi_{\\text{ext}}/\\Phi_0$. Using this condition, we can eliminate one degree of freedom and treat the SQUID-loop as a single junction, but with the important modification that $E_J$ is tunable (via the SQUID critical current) by means of the external flux $\\Phi_{\\text{ext}}$. The effective Hamiltonian of the so-called split transmon (ignoring the constant) is\n\n$$\n\nH = 4E_C n^2 - \\underbrace{2E_J \\left| \\cos\\left(\\varphi_e\\right)\\right|}_{E_{J}'(\\varphi_e)}\\cos(\\phi).\n\\label{Eq:HsplitTransmon}\n\n$$\n\nWe can see that Eq. (<ref>) is analogous to Eq. (<ref>), with $E_J$ replaced by $E_{J}'(\\varphi_e) = 2E_J \\left|\\cos\\left(\\varphi_e\\right)\\right|$. The magnitude of the net, effective Josephson energy $E_{J}'$ has a period of $\\Phi_0$ in applied flux and spans from $0$ to its maximum value $2E_J$. Therefore, the qubit frequency can be tuned periodically with $\\Phi_{\\text{ext}}$, see Fig. <ref>(b).\n\nWhile the split transmon enables frequency tunability by the externally applied magnetic field, it also introduces sensitivity to random flux fluctuations, known as flux noise. At any working point, the slope of the qubit spectrum, $\\partial \\freq/\\partial\\Phi_{\\text{ext}}$, indicates to first order how strongly this flux noise affects the qubit frequency. The sensitivity is generally non-zero, except at multiples of the flux quantum, $\\Phi_{\\text{ext}} = k\\Phi_{\\text{0}}$, where $k$ is an integer, where $\\partial \\freq/\\partial\\Phi_{\\text{ext}} = 0$.\n\nOne recent development has focused on reducing the qubit sensitivity to flux noise, while maintaining sufficient tunability to operate our quantum gates. The idea is to make the two junctions in the split transmon asymmetric[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], see Fig. <ref>(c). This yields the following Hamiltonian\n\n$$\n\nH = 4E_Cn^2 - \\underbrace{{E_{J\\Sigma}\\sqrt{\\cos^2(\\varphi_e) + d^2\\sin^2(\\varphi_e)}}}_{E'_J(\\varphi_e)}\\cos(\\phi),\n\\label{Eq:AsymmetricTransmon}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $E_{J\\Sigma} = E_{J1} + E_{J2}$ and $d = (\\gamma - 1)/(\\gamma + 1)$ is the junction asymmetry parameter, with $\\gamma = E_{J2}/E_{J1}$. Again, we can treat the two junctions as a single-junction transmon, with an effective Josephson energy $E_{J}'(\\varphi_e)$. In particular, we can recognize the two special cases; for $d = 0$, the Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) reduces to the symmetric case with $E_{J}'(\\varphi_e) = E_{J\\Sigma}\\left|\\cos(\\varphi_e)\\right|$, as in Eq. (<ref>) with $E_{J\\Sigma} = 2E_J$. In the other limit, when $|d| \\rightarrow 1$, $E_{J}'(\\varphi_e) \\rightarrow E_{J\\Sigma}$ and the flux-tunability of the Josephson energy vanishes, which is equivalent to the single junction case, recall Eq. (<ref>).\n\nFrom the discussion above we see that going from symmetric to asymmetric transmons does not change the circuit topology. This seemingly trivial modification, however, has profound impact for practical applications. As we can see from the qubit spectra, Fig. <ref>(d), the flux sensitivity is suppressed across the entire tunable frequency range. For example, the performance of the cross-resonance gate is optimized with certain frequency detuning between two qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Therefore, by using an asymmetric transmon, a small frequency-tuning range is introduced that is sufficient to compensate for fabrication variations, without introducing unnecessary large susceptibility to flux noise and thus maintaining high coherence. For another example, a surface code scheme based on the adiabatic -gate requires specific frequency configuration among qubits in order to avoid frequency crowding issues, and asymmetric transmons fit well with its well-defined frequency range[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In general, as the quantum processors scale up and fabrication improves, asymmetric transmons are likely to be found in wider applications in the future.\n\n#### Towards larger anharmonicity: flux qubit and fluxonium\nWe see that split transmon qubits, be it symmetric or not, still share the same topology as the single junction version, yielding a sinusoidal potential. Therefore, the degree to which the properties of these qubits can be engineered has not fundamentally changed. In particular, the limited anharmonicity in transmon-type qubits intrinsically causes significant residual excitation to higher-energy states, undermining performance of gate operations. To go beyond this, it is necessary to introduce additional complexity into the circuit.\n\nOne outstanding development in this regard is the invention of the flux qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where the qubit loop is interrupted by three (or four) junctions, see Fig. <ref>(e). On one branch is one smaller junction; on the other branch are two identical junctions, both a factor $\\gamma$ larger in size compared to the small junction. The addition of one more junction as compared to the split transmon is non-trivial, as it changes the circuit topology and reshapes the potential energy profile.\n\nEach junction is associated with a phase variable, and the fluxoid quantization condition again allows us to eliminate one degree of freedom. Consequently, we have a two-dimensional potential landscape, which in comparison to the simpler topology of the transmon, complicates the problem both conceptually and computationally. Fortunately, under the assumed setting that the array junctions are larger in size ($\\gamma > 1$), it is usually a good approximation to treat the problem as a particle moving in a quasi-1D potential, which also helps us gain more insight and intuition about the system and draw qualitative conclusions. The Hamiltonian under this quasi-1D approximation reads,\n\n$$\n\nH \\approx 4E_Cn^2 - E_{J}\\cos(2\\phi + \\varphi_e) - 2\\gamma E_J\\cos(\\phi).\n\\label{Eq:FluxQubit}\n\n$$\n\nNote that the phase variable in Eq. (<ref>) is the sum of the branch phases across the two array junctions, $\\phi = (\\varphi_1 + \\varphi_2)/2$, assuming the same current direction across $\\varphi_1$ and $\\varphi_2$. The external magnetic flux is denoted $\\varphi_e = 2 \\pi  \\Phi_{ext}/\\Phi_0$. The second term in Eq. (<ref>) is contributed by the small junction with Josephson energy $E_J$, whereas the third term takes into account the two array junctions, together with Josephson energy $2\\gamma E_J$. Clearly, the sum of these two terms no longer has the characteristics of a simple cosinusoid, and the final potential profile as well as the corresponding eigenstates depends on both the external flux $\\varphi_e$ and the junction area ratio $\\gamma$.\n\nThe most common working point for this system is when $\\varphi_e = \\pi + 2\\pi k$, where $k$ is an integer \u2013 that is when half a superconducting flux quantum threads the qubit loop. At this flux bias point, the qubit spectrum reaches its minimum, and the qubit frequency is first-order insensitive to flux noise, see Fig. <ref>(f). This point is often referred to as the flux degeneracy point, where flux qubits tend to have the optimal coherence time.\n\nAt this operation point, the potential energy may assume a single-well ($\\gamma \\geq 2$) or a double-well ($\\gamma < 2$) profile. The single-well case shares some simularities with the transmon qubit, where the quadratic and quartic terms of the Hamiltonian determines the harmonicity and anharmonicity, respectively. The capacitively-shunted flux qubit (CSFQ)[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] was explored in this regime, demonstrating long coherence and decently high anharmonicity. Note that as opposed to the transmon qubit, the anharmonicity of the CSFQ is positive ($\\alpha > 0$). While the improvement in anharmonicity can be associated with reshaping the energy potential, the improved coherence over the first flux qubits can be attributed to the introduction of the capacitive shunt, similar to the modified Cooper-pair box leading to the transmon qubit.\n\nThe double-well case obtained for $\\gamma < 2$ was demonstrated and investigated much earlier[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The intuitive picture based on circulating current states \u2013 so it gets the name persisting-current flux qubit (PCFQ) \u2013 gives a satisfying physical description of the qubit degrees of freedom. However, from the perspective of a quantum engineer, the qubit properties are of more interest, even if sometimes we may lose physical intuition about the system in certain regimes; such as when $\\gamma \\approx 2$ and there are no clear circulating current states. The most important feature of the PCFQ is that its anharmonicity can be much greater than the transmon and CSFQ and the transition matrix elements $|\\langle 1|\\hat{n}|0\\rangle|, |\\langle 1|\\hat{\\phi}|0\\rangle|$ become considerably smaller given equivalent $E_J / E_C$. Therefore, a longer relaxation time can be expected. These features have been demonstrated even more prominently in its close relative, the fluxonium qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe flux qubit is a striking example that illustrates how one dramatically can engineer the qubit properties through the choice of various circuit parameters. The introduction of array junctions and consequent biharmonic profile generates rich dynamics as well as broad applications. An extention of this idea is the fluxonium qubit, which generated substantial interest recently, due partly to its capability of engineering the transition matrix elements to achieve millisecond $T_1$ time, and due partly to the invention of novel gate schemes applicable to such well-protected qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nCompared to flux qubits, which usually contain two or three array junctions[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the number of array junctions in the fluxonium qubit is dramatically increased[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], in some cases, to the order of $100$, see Fig. <ref>(g). Following the same quasi-1D approximation as for the flux qubit, the last term in Eq. (<ref>) becomes $-N\\gamma E_J \\cos (\\phi/N)$, where $N$ denotes the number of array junctions. For large $N$, the argument in the cosine term $\\phi/N$ becomes sufficiently small that a second order expansion is a good approximation. This results in the fluxonium Hamiltonian,\n\n$$\n\nH \\approx 4E_Cn^2 - E_{J}\\cos(\\phi + \\varphi_e) + \\frac{1}{2}E_L \\phi^2,\n\\label{Eq:Fluxonium}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $E_L = (\\gamma/N)E_J$ is the inductive energy of the effective inductance contributed by the junction array \u2013 often known as superinductance due to its large value\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Therefore, we can treat the potential energy as a quadratic term modulated by a sinusoidal term, similar to that of an rf-SQUID type flux qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, the kinetic inductance of the Josephson junction array is in general much larger than the geometric inductance of the wire in an rf-SQUID.\n\nDepending on the relative magnitude of $E_J$ and $E_L$, the fluxonium system could involve plasmon states (in the same well) and fluxon states (in different wells). There are a variety of schemes to utilize them for quantum information processing. Generally, the spectrum of the transition between the lowest energy states is similar to that of the flux qubit, see Fig. <ref>(h). Both long coherence and high anharmonicity can be expected at the flux sweet spot.\n\nLastly, we want to point out a further extension \u2013 the $0-\\pi$ qubit \u2013 which has even stronger topological protection from noise[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, the strongly suppressed sensitivity to external fluctuations also makes it hard to manipulate.\n\nInteraction Hamiltonian engineering\n\nTo generate entanglement between individual quantum systems \u2013 it is necessary to engineer an interaction Hamiltonian that connects degrees of freedom in those individual systems. In this section, we discuss the physical coupling mechanism and its representation in the qubit eigenbasis. The use of coupling to form 2-qubit gates is discussed in Sec. <ref>.\n\n#### Physical coupling: capacitive and inductive\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic of capacitive and inductive coupling schemes between two superconducting qubits, labeled $1$ and $2$. (a) Direct capacitive coupling, where the voltage nodes of two qubits $V_1$ and $V_2$ are connected by a capacitance $C_g$. (b) Capacitive coupling via a coupler in form of a linear resonator. (c) Direct inductive coupling, where the two qubits are coupled via mutual inductance, $M_{12}$. (d) Inductive coupling via mutual inductances $M_{1C}$ and $M_{2C}$ to a frequency-tunable coupler.\n\nThe Hamiltonian of two coupled systems takes a generic form\n\n$$\n\nH = H_1 + H_2 + H_{\\text{int}},\n\\label{Eq:Hcoupling}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $H_1$ and $H_2$ denote the Hamiltonians of the individual quantum systems, which could be any combination of the qubit circuits mentioned in Sec. <ref> and <ref>. The last term, $H_{\\text{int}}$, is the interaction Hamiltonian, which couples variables of both systems. In superconducting circuits, the physical form of the coupling energy is either an electric or magnetic field (or a combination thereof).\n\nTo achieve capacitive coupling, a capacitor is placed between the voltage nodes of the two participating circuits, yielding an interaction Hamiltonian $H_{\\text{int}}$ of the form\n\n$$\n\nH_{\\text{int}} = C_g V_1 V_2,\n\\label{Eq:HintAB}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $C_g$ is the coupling capacitance and $V_1 (V_2)$ is the voltage operator of the corresponding voltage node being connected. Fig. $\\ref{Fig:QubitInteraction}$(a) illustrates a realistic example of a direct capacitive coupling between the top nodes of two transmon qubits. Circuit quantization in the limit of $C_g \\ll C_1,C_2$ yields\n\nH = \u2211_i = 1,2[ 4E_C,in_i^2 - E_J,icos(\u03d5_i)]\n\n$$\n\n+ 4e^2\\frac{C_g}{C_1 C_2}n_1 n_2,\n\\label{Eq:HsystCap}\n\n$$\n\nwhere the expressions in brackets are the two Hamiltonians of the individual qubits, [see Eq. (<ref>)], and we take $V_i = (2e/C_i)n_i$ in Eq. (<ref>). From Eq. (<ref>), we see that the coupling energy depends on the coupling capacitance as well as the matrix elements of the voltage operators. The dependencies are bilinear in the perturbative limit ($C_g \\ll C_1, C_2$).\n\nTo implement the coupling capacitance, one only need bring the edges of the capacitor pads into close proximity, as has been demonstrated in state-of-the-art planar designs[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The coupling capacitance is determined by the planar capacitor geometry as well as the surrounding environment, such as the dielectric constant of the substrate and the ground plane proximity.\n\nIn the case of inductive coupling, a mutual inductance shared by two loops is the coupling mechanism,\n\nyielding an interaction Hamiltonian that\n\nis of the intuitive form\n\n$$\n\n%\\textcolor{red}{\nH_{\\text{int}} = M_{12} I_1 I_2,\n%}\n\\label{Eq:Mint}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $M_{12}$ denotes the mutual inductance between the loops and $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the current operators for the currents through the inductors.\n\nA typical example comprises two closely positioned (rf-SQUID type) flux qubits, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c). The system Hamiltonian can be expressed as (see Refs.\u00a0Burkard2004,Weber2017):\n\n$$\n\n%\\textcolor{red}{\nH = \\sum_{i = 1,2} \\left[ 4E_{C,i}n_{i}^2 - E_{J,i}\\cos(\\phi_i) + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\Phi_{Li}^2 }{L_i(1-K^2)}\\right]\n%}\n\\\\\n%\\textcolor{red}{\n- M_{12}(1-K^2) \\frac{\\Phi_{L1}}{L_1(1-K^2)}\\frac{\\Phi_{L2}}{L_2(1-K^2)},\n%    }\n\\label{Eq:Mint-Phi}\n\n$$\n\nwhere the first two terms are the energies associated with the Josephson junctions, the third term captures the inductor energies, and the fourth term is the mutual coupling energy of the form $M I_1 I_2$ (note that in general $\\Phi=LI$). $\\Phi_{L1}$ and $\\Phi_{L2}$ are the magnetic fluxes associated with the currents flowing through the respective inductors, and $K$ is the unitless mutual coupling factor defined by $M_{12} = K \\sqrt{L_1 L_2}$.\n\nImportantly, note that in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), $K^2$ renormalizes $L_1$, $L_2$ and $M_{12}$, essentially capturing the loading effect on the circuit due to their presence, and is found by inverting an inductance matrix (see Refs.\u00a0Burkard2004,Weber2017).\n\nAs we did with the charge degree of freedom, we will normalize the inductor and externally applied magnetic fluxes \u2013 in this case, by the reduced quantum unit of flux $\\Phi_0/2\\pi$ \u2013  to define phases $\\phi \\equiv \\Phi/(\\Phi_0/2\\pi)$ that are on the same footing as the junction phases $\\phi_{1,2}$. Due to fluxoid quantization around the closed loop, these phases must sum to zero or an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. For current directions entering the top of the junctions [with $I_1$ counterclockwise and $I_2$ as shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c)], $\\phi_{i}-\\phi_{Li} = \\phi_{ei}+ 2\\pi n$ with $n=0, \\pm1,\\ldots$ (see, for example, Ref.\u00a0Orlando1999). Replacing $\\phi_{L1(L2)}$ with $\\phi_{1(2)} - \\phi_{1(e2)}$  yields:\n\n$$\n\n%\\textcolor{red}{\n= \\sum_{i = 1,2} \\left[ 4E_{C,i}n_{i}^2 - E_{J,i}\\cos(\\phi_i) +\n\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\Phi_0}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 (\\phi_{i} - \\phi_{ei})^2 }{L_i(1-K^2)}\\right]\n%}\n\\\\\n%\n%\\textcolor{red}{\n- M_{12}(1-K^2) \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\Phi_0}{2\\pi}\\right) (\\phi_{1} - \\phi_{e1})}{L_1(1-K^2)}\\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\Phi_0}{2\\pi}\\right)(\\phi_{2} - \\phi_{e2})}{L_2(1-K^2)}.\n%   }\n\\label{Eq:Mint-phi}\n\n$$\n\nThe coupling is of the form $M_{1,2} I_1 I_2$, with both the mutual coupling and the circulating currents (via the $L_1$ and $L_2$) \u201crenormalized\u201d by the factor $(1-K^2)$. To capture the renormalization explicitly, the Hamiltonian is generally simulated using phase operators (Eq.\u00a0<ref>), rather than current operators.\n\nIn the weak-coupling limit $K^2 \\ll 1$ (equivalently, $M^2 \\ll L_1 L_2 $), the coupling term may be approximated by the Josephson currents with $M_{12} I_1 I_2 \\approx M_{12} I_{c1}\\sin \\phi_1 I_{c2} \\sin \\phi_2$. Note, however, that this simplifying approximation is only exact in the pathological limit of no coupling.\n\nTo realize a mutual inductance, two looped circuits are brought into close proximity to one another, or, to make it stronger, overlap with each other\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and even may share the same wire or Josephson junction inductor\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn the case of a Josephson junction, and for certain metals, the inductance is dominated by kinetic inductance contributions, rather than solely geometric inductance\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Kinetic inductance arises from the mechanical, inertial mass of the charge carriers, but is only practically witnessed in very high-conductance materials like superconductors. A primary feature of kinetic inductance is that its values can vastly exceed those of conventional geometric inductances, which are generally limited by electromagnetic considerations\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nCoupling axis: transverse and longitudinal\n\nRegardless of its physical realization, the effect of a coupling on system dynamics is determined by its form as represented in the eigenbasis of the individual systems. That is, how $H_{\\text{int}}$ appears in the representation spanned by the eigenbasis of $H_1 \\otimes H_2$.\n\nLet us start with the previous example of two capacitively coupled transmon qubits [Fig. <ref>(a)]. Using second quantization, the system Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) can be expressed as\n\nH = \u2211_i \u22081,2[ \u03c9_i a_i^\u2020a_i + \u03b1_i/2a_i^\u2020a_i^\u2020a_ia_i]\n\n$$\n\n- g \\left(a_1 - a_{1}^{\\dagger}\\right)\\left(a_2 - a_{2}^{\\dagger}\\right),\n\\label{Eq:HsystDiagC}\n\n$$\n\nwhere the expression within brackets represent the Duffing oscillator Hamiltonian for the qubits and $g$ is the coupling energy. Since we define $V \\propto n \\propto i(a - a^{\\dagger})$, and consequently $I \\propto \\phi \\propto (a + a^{\\dagger})$, the original $n_{1}n_{2}$-term becomes what is shown in Eq. (<ref>). Such a coupling is called transverse, because the coupling Hamiltonian has non-zero matrix elements only at off-diagonal positions with respect to both oscillators, i.e. $_{i}\\langle k|a_{i} - a_{i}^{\\dagger}|k\\rangle_{i} = 0$ for any integer $k$ and for $i \\in {1,2}$ and in this case $_{i}\\langle k \\pm 1|a_{i} - a_{i}^{\\dagger}|k\\rangle_{i} \\neq 0$.\n\nIf we can ignore higher energy levels ($k \\geq 2$) either because of sufficient anharmonicity or through careful control protocols that ensure these levels never have influence, we may truncate the Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) to\n\n$$\n\nH = \\sum_{i \\in {1,2}} \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_i \\sigma_{z,i} + g \\sigma_{y,1}\\sigma_{y,2}.\n\\label{Eq:HsystDiagCtrunc}\n\n$$\n\nThis is a Hamiltonian of two spins, coupled by an exchange interaction. As we will see in Sec. <ref>, such a Hamiltonian is most commonly used in contemporary implementations and can generate various types of two-qubit entangling gates. Note that, more often, we see that the interaction term is expressed in $\\sigma_{x}\\sigma_{x}$ instead of $\\sigma_{y}\\sigma_{y}$. The choice in the context here is arbitrary and does not change the dynamics. However, when both capacitive and inductive couplings are present in the system, both $\\sigma_{x}\\sigma_{x}$ and $\\sigma_{y}\\sigma_{y}$ may be needed. In this case, the voltage operator $V \\propto i(a - a^{\\dagger})$ (reduced to $\\sigma_{y}$ after two-level approximation in the lab frame) is transversal to the current operator $I \\propto (a + a^{\\dagger})$ (reduced to $\\sigma_{x}$) and both of them may be transverse to the qubit. A similar example is demonstrated between a qubit and a resonator by Lu et al.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n\nTransverse coupling can be engineered between a qubit and a harmonic oscillator, see Fig. <ref>(b). In this case, the Hamiltonian becomes\n\n$$\n\nH = \\frac{1}{2}\\freq \\sigma_{z} + \\omega_{r}a^{\\dagger}a + g (\\sigma_{+}a + \\sigma_{-}a^{\\dagger}),\n\\label{Eq:HsystCircuitQED}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\freq$ and $\\omega_r$ denote the qubit and resonator frequencies, and $\\sigma_+ = |0\\rangle \\langle1|$ and $\\sigma_- = |1\\rangle\\langle 0|$ describes the processes of exciting and de-exciting the qubit, respectively. Here, we have assumed that the coupling is in the dispersive limit, i.e. $g \\ll \\freq, \\omega_r$, hence ignoring the double (de)excitation terms proportional to $\\sigma_{+}a^{\\dagger}$ and $\\sigma_{-}a$, which under typical operation regimes oscillate sufficiently fast to average to zero. The Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>), is the standard model used for describing how a two-level atom interacts with a resonant cavity that houses it. Such a structure is also known as cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED), and it is extended to the circuit version here. It has many useful applications in superconducting quantum information architectures, such as high-fidelity readout[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], see Sec. <ref>, cavity buses[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], quantum memory[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], quantum computation with cat states[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], etc.\n\nHere, we briefly mention the use of a cavity or resonator to mediate coupling between two qubits, which may be physically well-separated ($\\approx 1\\,$cm). Since most superconducting resonators are in the GHz frequency range, they can be made much longer than any dimension of a qubit circuit ($\\approx 1\\,$mm). One can use such a resonator to mediate coupling between two or more otherwise non-interacting qubits. An example is shown in Fig. <ref>(b), where two transmon qubits are both capacitively coupled to the center resonator. The two-level system Hamiltonian is:\n\nH = \u2211_i = 1,2( \u03c9_i a_i^\u2020a_i + \u03b1_i/2a_i^\u2020a_i^\u2020a_ia_i) + \u03c9_r a_r^\u2020a_r\n\n$$\n\n+ g_{1r} \\left(a_{1}^{\\dagger}a_{r} + a_{1}a_{r}^{\\dagger}\\right) + g_{2r} \\left(a_{2}^{\\dagger}a_{r} + a_{2} a_{r}^{\\dagger}\\right).\n\\label{Eq:HsystCircuitQED2}\n\n$$\n\nIt can be shown that in the dispersive limit, i.e. $g_{ir} \\ll |\\omega_i - \\omega_r|$, the resonator can \u2013 after proper transformation and approximation \u2013 be treated as an isolated system, and the composite system simplified to two transversely coupled qubits, see Eq. (<ref>).\n\nWe now turn to the previous example of two inductively coupled flux qubits, see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c). Assume that the double-well potential [Fig. <ref>(g)] has a relatively high inter-well barrier, which leads to an exponentially small qubit transition frequency at the energy degeneracy point, ($\\Phi_{e} = \\pi$). Around this degeneracy point, the off-diagonal matrix element of $\\sin(\\phi)$ is zero, i.e. the ground and excited states are localized in different wells and $\\langle 1 | \\sin(\\phi) | 1\\rangle - \\langle 0 | \\sin(\\phi) | 0\\rangle \\neq 0$. We can then rewrite the Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) as\n\n$$\n\nH = \\sum_{i = 1,2} \\frac{1}{2}\\omega_i \\sigma_{zi} + g \\sigma_{z1}\\sigma_{z2}.\n\\label{Eq:HsystDiagL}\n\n$$\n\nNow, the coupling axis is the same as the qubit quantization axes and therefore termed longitudinal coupling. Note, however, that the physical $\\sigma_{x}\\sigma_{x}$ and $\\sigma_{z}\\sigma_{z}$ couplings can change in the qubit frame.\n\nLongitudinal coupling is an important type of interaction, because it can generate entanglement without energy exchange. Moreover, it is found a necessary ingredient in the application of quantum annealing, where certain hard combinatorial optimization problems can be modeled by the Ising Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) and finding its ground state would solve this problem.\n\nAn intermediate qubit mode may also be used as a coupler in the longitudinal case. In Fig. <ref>(d), an additional rf-SQUID is used to mediate the coupling. The coupling strength can be tuned by the flux bias of the coupler SQUID[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Note that a tunable coupler may also be realized in a structure with capacitive couplings[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. A tunable coupler is useful because it provides a wide range of coupling strengths[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], a high on-off ratio[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for reducing gate error-rates, and more ways of achieving high-fidelity entangling gates[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The trade-off is an additional control line.\n\nIn addition to the pure transversal and longitudinal qubit-qubit interactions, there are also examples of mixed types of interaction Hamiltonians[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n\n$$\n\nH = \\frac{1}{2}\\freq \\sigma_{z} + \\omega_{r}a^{\\dagger}a + g \\sigma_{z}(a + a^{\\dagger}),\n\\label{Eq:HsystDiagLC}\n\n$$\n\nwhich are longitudinal with respect to a qubit, but transverse with respect to a harmonic oscillator in a qubit-resonator system. Such a model is called longitudinal but one should note that it is only longitudinal to one participating system. It is hard to engineer physically longitudinal coupling with respect to a harmonic oscillator, since either the $E$-field ($V$) or the $B$-field ($I$) is transverse with respect to the eigen field of the harmonic oscillator. Note, however, that a transversal model such as in Eq. (<ref>) may be transformed into a longitudinal one in certain operating regimes, see Sec. <ref>.\n\nIn some applications, such as for quantum annealing, both longitudinal and transverse couplings are desired ($\\sigma_z \\sigma_z$ coupling for mapping the problem and $\\sigma_x \\sigma_x$ coupling for enhancing the annealing performance) and require independent control.\n\nNOISE, DECOHERENCE, AND ERROR MITIGATION\n\nRandom, uncontrollable physical processes in the qubit control and measurement equipment or in the local environment surrounding the quantum processor are sources of noise that lead to decoherence and reduce the operational fidelity of the qubits. In this section, we introduce the basics of noise leading to decoherence in superconducting circuits, and we discuss coherent control methods to mitigate certain types of noise.\n\n### Types of noise\nIn a closed system, the dynamical evolution of a qubit state is deterministic. That is, if we know the starting state of the qubit and its Hamiltonian, then we can predict the state of the qubit at any time in the future. However, in open systems, the situation changes. The qubit now interacts with uncontrolled degrees of freedom in its environment, which we refer to as fluctuations or noise. In the presence of noise, as time progresses, the qubit state looks less and less like the state we would have predicted and, eventually, the state is lost. There are many different sources of noise that affect quantum systems, and they can be categorized into two primary types: systematic noise and stochastic noise.\n\n#### Systematic noise\nSystematic noise arises from a process that is traceable to a fixed control or readout error. For example, we apply a microwave pulse to the qubit that we believe will impart a 180-degree rotation. However, the control field is not tuned properly and, rather than rotating the qubit 180 degrees, the pulse slightly over-rotates or under-rotates the qubit by a fixed amount. The underlying error is systematic, and it therefore leads to the same rotation error each time it is applied. However, when such erroneous pulses are used in practice in a variety of control sequences, the observed results may appear to be influenced by random noise. This is because the pulse is generally not applied in the same way for each experiment: it could be applied a different number of times, interspersed with different pulses in different orders, and therefore generally differs from experiment to experiment. However, once systematic errors are identified, they can generally be corrected through proper calibration or the use of improved hardware.\n\n#### Stochastic noise\nThe second type of noise is stochastic noise, arising from random fluctuations of parameters that are coupled to our qubit\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For example, thermal noise of a 50$\\Omega$ resistor in the control lines leading to the qubit will have voltage and current fluctuations \u2013 Johnson noise \u2013 with a noise power that is proportional to both temperature and bandwidth. Or, the oscillator that provides the carrier for a qubit control pulse may have amplitude or phase fluctuations. Additionally, randomly fluctuating electric and magnetic fields in the local qubit environment \u2013 e.g., on the metal surface, on the substrate surface, at the metal-substrate interface, or inside the substrate \u2013 can couple to the qubit. This creates unknown and uncontrolled fluctuations of one or more qubit parameters, and this leads to qubit decoherence.\n\nNoise strength and qubit susceptibility\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nTransverse and longitudinal noise represented on the Bloch sphere.\n\n(a) Bloch sphere representation of the quantum state $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle = \\alpha \\lvert 0 \\rangle + \\beta \\lvert 1 \\rangle$. The qubit quantization axis \u2013 the $z$ axis \u2013 is longitudinal in the qubit frame, corresponding to $\\sigma_z$ terms in the qubit Hamiltonian. The $x$-$y$ plane\n\nis transverse in the qubit frame, corresponding to $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$ terms in the qubit Hamiltonian.\n\n(b) Longitudinal relaxation results from energy exchange between the qubit and its environment, due to transverse noise that couples to the qubit in the $x-y$ plane and drives transitions $\\lvert 0 \\rangle \\leftrightarrow \\lvert 1\\rangle$. A qubit in state $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ emits energy to the environment and relaxes to $\\lvert 0\\rangle$ with a rate $\\Gamma_{1\\downarrow}$ (blue arched arrow). Similarly, a qubit in state $\\lvert 0\\rangle$ absorbs energy from the environment, exciting it to $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ with a rate $\\Gamma_{1\\uparrow}$ (orange arched arrow). In the typical operating regime $k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\ll \\hbar \\freq$, the up-rate is suppressed, leading to the overall decay rate $\\Gamma_1 \\approx \\Gamma_{1\\downarrow}$.\n\n(c) Pure dephasing in the transverse plane arises from longitudinal noise along the $z$ axis that\n\nfluctuates the qubit frequency. A Bloch vector along the $x$-axis will diffuse clockwise or counterclockwise around the equator due to the stochastic frequency fluctuations, depolarizing the azimuthal phase with a rate $\\Gamma_{\\phi}$.\n\n(d) Transverse relaxation results in a loss of coherence at a rate $\\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma_1/2 + \\Gamma_{\\phi}$, due to a combination of energy relaxation and pure dephasing. Pure dephasing leads to decoherence of the quantum state $(1/\\sqrt{2})(\\lvert 0 \\rangle + \\lvert 1 \\rangle)$, initially pointed along the $x$-axis. Additionally, the excited state component of the superposition state  may relax to the ground state, a phase-breaking process that loses the orientation of the vector in the $x$-$y$ plane.\n\nThe degree to which a qubit is affected by noise is related to the amount of noise impinging on the qubit, and the qubit's susceptibility to that noise. The former is often a question of materials science and fabrication; that is, can we make devices with lower levels of noise. Or, it may be related to the quality of the control electronics and cryogenic engineering to limit the levels of noise on the control lines that necessarily connect to the qubits to control them. The latter \u2013 qubit susceptibility \u2013 is a question of qubit design. Qubits can be designed to trade off sensitivity to one type of noise at the expense of increased sensitivity to other types of noise. Thus, materials science, fabrication engineering, electronics design, cryogenic engineering, and qubit design all play a role in creating devices with high coherence. In general, one should strive to eliminate the sources of noise, and then design qubits that are insensitive to the residual noise.\n\nThe qubit response to noise depends on how the noise couples to it \u2013 either through a longitudinal or a transverse coupling as referenced to the qubit quantization axis. This can be visualized using a Bloch Sphere picture of the qubit state, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Bloch-sphere-noise) and discussed in detail in Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\nModeling noise and decoherence\n\n#### Bloch sphere representation\nThe Bloch sphere is a unit sphere used to represent the quantum state of a two-level system (qubit). Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Bloch-sphere-noise)(a) shows a Bloch sphere with a Bloch vector representing the state $\\lvert \\psi\\rangle = \\alpha \\lvert 0\\rangle + \\beta \\lvert 1\\rangle$. If we visualize the Bloch sphere as the planet Earth, then by convention, the north pole represents state $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$ and the south pole state $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$. For pure quantum states such as $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle$, the Bloch vector is of unit length, $\\lvert \\alpha \\rvert^2+\\lvert \\beta \\rvert^2=1$, connecting the center of the sphere to any point on its surface.\n\nThe $z$-axis connects the north and south poles. It is called the longitudinal axis, since it represents the qubit quantization axis for the states $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$ and $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$ in the qubit eigenbasis. In turn, the $x$-$y$ plane is the transverse plane with transverse axes $x$ and $y$. In this Cartesian coordinate system, the unit Bloch vector $\\vec{a}=(\\sin \\theta \\cos \\phi, \\sin \\theta \\sin \\phi, \\cos \\theta)$ is represented using the polar angle $0\\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$ and the azimuthal angle $0 \\leq \\phi < 2\\pi$, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Bloch-sphere-noise) (a). Following our convention, state $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$ at the north pole is associated with $+1$, and state $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$ (the south pole) with $-1$. We can similarly represent the quantum state using the angles $\\theta$ and $\\phi$,\n\n$$\n\n\\lvert \\psi \\rangle = \\alpha \\lvert 0 \\rangle + \\beta \\lvert 1 \\rangle = \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\lvert 0 \\rangle + e^{i \\phi}\\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\lvert 1 \\rangle.\n\\label{Eq:Bloch-vector-stationary}\n\n$$\n\nThe Bloch vector is stationary on the Bloch sphere in the rotating frame picture. If state $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$ has a higher energy than state $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$ (as it generally does in superconducting qubits), then in a stationary frame, the Bloch vector would precess around the $z$-axis at the qubit frequency $(E_1-E_0)/\\hbar$. Without loss of generality (and much easier to visualize), we instead choose to view the Bloch sphere in a reference frame where the $x$ and $y$-axes also rotate around the $z$-axis at the qubit frequency. In this rotating frame, the Bloch vector appears stationary as written in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). The rotating frame will be described in detail in Section\u00a0<ref> in the context of single-qubit gates.\n\nFor completeness, we note that the density matrix $\\rho=\\lvert \\psi \\rangle \\langle \\psi \\vert$ for a pure state $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle$ is equivalently\n\n$$\n\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{2}(I + \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma})\n&= \\frac{1}{2}\n\\left(\n\\begin{matrix}\n1+\\cos \\theta & e^{-i\\phi} \\sin \\theta \\\\\ne^{i\\phi} \\sin \\theta  & 1+ \\sin \\theta\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right) \\\\\n%\n&= \\left(\n\\begin{matrix}\n\\cos^2\\frac{\\theta}{2} & e^{-i\\phi}\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\\\\ne^{i\\phi}\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2}  & \\sin^2\\frac{\\theta}{2}\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right) \\\\\n%\n&=\\left(\n\\begin{matrix}\n|\\alpha|^2 & \\alpha \\beta^*  \\\\\n\\alpha^* \\beta  & |\\beta|^2\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right)\n\\label{eq:rho}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $I$ is the identity matrix, and $\\vec{\\sigma} = [\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y, \\sigma_z]$ is a vector of Pauli matrices. If the Bloch vector $\\vec{a}$ is a unit vector, then $\\rho$ represents a pure state $\\psi$ and $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho^2)=1$. More generally, the Bloch sphere can be used to represent mixed states, for which $\\lvert \\vec{a} \\rvert < 1$; in this case, the Bloch vector terminates at points inside the unit sphere, and $0\\leq \\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho^2)<1$. To summarize, the surface of the unit sphere represents pure states, and its interior represents mixed states[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n#### Bloch-Redfield model of decoherence\nWithin the standard Bloch-Redfield\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] picture of two-level system dynamics, noise sources weakly coupled to the qubits have short correlation times with respect to the system dynamics. In this case, the relaxation processes are characterized by two rates (see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Bloch-sphere-noise)):\n\n$$\n\n&\\textrm{longitudinal relaxation rate:} &\\Gamma_1 &\\equiv \\frac{1}{T_1}  \\\\\n&\\textrm{transverse relaxation rate:} &\\Gamma_2 &\\equiv \\frac{1}{T_2} = \\frac{\\Gamma_1}{2} + \\Gamma_{\\varphi} \\label{Eq:T2}\n\n$$\nwhich contains the pure dephasing rate $\\Gamma_{\\varphi}$. We note that the definition of $\\Gamma_2$ as a sum of rates presumes that the individual decay functions are exponential, which occurs for Lorentzian noise spectra (centered at $\\omega=0$) such as white noise (short correlation times) with a high-frequency cutoff.\n\nThe impact of noise on the qubit can be visualized on the Bloch sphere in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Bloch-sphere-noise)(a). For an initial state ($t=0$)\n$$\n\n\\lvert \\psi \\rangle = \\alpha |0 \\rangle + \\beta |1\\rangle,\n\n$$\nthe Bloch-Redfield density matrix $\\rho_{\\textrm{BR}}$ for the qubit is written\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ],\n\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:rho_RB}\n\\rho_{\\textrm{BR}} =\n\\left(\n\\begin{matrix}\n1 + (|\\alpha|^2-1) e^{- \\Gamma_1 t} & \\alpha \\beta^* e^{i \\delta \\omega t} e^{- \\Gamma_2 t} \\\\\n\\alpha^* \\beta e^{-i \\delta \\omega t} e^{- \\Gamma_2 t} & |\\beta|^2 e^{- \\Gamma_1 t}\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right).\n\n$$\nThere are a few important distinctions between Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), which we list here and then describe in more detail in subsequent sections.\n\n* First, we have introduced the longitudinal decay function $\\exp(-\\Gamma_1 t)$, which accounts for longitudinal relaxation of the qubit.\n\n* Second, we introduced the transverse decay function $\\exp(-\\Gamma_2 t)$, which accounts for transverse decay of the qubit.\n\n* Third, we have introduced an explicit phase accrual $\\exp(i \\delta \\omega t)$, where $\\delta \\omega = \\omega_{\\textrm{q}} - \\omega_{\\textrm{d}}$, which generalizes the Bloch sphere picture to account for cases where the qubit frequency $\\omega_{\\textrm{q}}$ differs from the rotating-frame frequency $\\omega_{\\textrm{d}}$, as we will see later when discussing measurements of $T_2$ using Ramsey interferometry[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and in Section\u00a0<ref> in the context of single-qubit gates.\n\n* And, fourth, we have constructed the matrix such that for $t \\gg (T_1, \\; T_2)$, the upper-left matrix element will approach unit value, indicating that all population relaxes to the ground state, while the other three matrix elements decay to zero. This is related to the assumption that the environmental temperature is low enough that thermal excitations of the qubit from the ground to excited state rarely occur.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nCharacterizing longitudinal $(T_1)$ and transverse $(T_2)$ relaxation times of a transmon qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n(a) Longitudinal relaxation (energy relaxation) measurement. The qubit is prepared in the excited state using an $\\X{\\pi}$-pulse and measured after a waiting time $\\tau$. For each value $\\tau$, this procedure is repeated to obtain an ensemble average of the qubit polarization: $+1$ corresponding to $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$, and $-1$ corresponding to $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$.\n\nThe resulting exponential decay function has a characteristic time $T_1 = 85$ $\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n(b) Transverse relaxation (decoherence) measurement via Ramsey interferometry. The qubit is prepared on the equator using an $\\X{\\pi/2}$-pulse, intentionally detuned from the qubit frequency by $\\delta \\omega$, causing the Bloch vector to precess in the rotating frame at a rate $\\delta \\omega$ around the $z$-axis. After a time $\\tau$, a second $\\X{\\pi/2}$ pulse then projects the Bloch vector back on to the $z$ axis, effectively mapping its former position on the equator to a position on the $z$ axis.\n\nThe oscillations decay with an approximately (but not exactly) exponential decay function, with a characteristic time $T_2^* = 95$ $\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n(c) Transverse relaxation (decoherence) measurement via a Hahn echo experiment\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The qubit is prepared and measured in the same manner as the Ramsey interfometry experiment, except that a single $X{\\pi}$ pulse is applied midway through the free-evolution time $\\tau$.\n\nThe decay function is approximately exponential, with a characteristic time $T_{2E} = 120$ $\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe coherence improvement using the Hahn echo over panel (b)\nindicates that some low-frequency dephasing noise has been mitigated; however, a small amount\nremains since $T_{2E}$ has not yet reached the $2 T_1$ limit.\n\n(d) Coherence function incorporating $T_1$ loss and Gaussian dephasing components of the Ramsey interferometry data in panel (b).\nThe Gaussian-distributed $1/f$ noise spectrum of magnetic flux noise leads to a decay function $\\exp(-t/2T_1)\\exp(-\\chi_N) = \\exp (-t/2T_1) \\exp(-t^2/T_{\\varphi,\\mathrm{G}}^2)$ in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). These two decay functions together match well the Ramsey data in panel (b).\n\nLongitudinal relaxation\n\nThe longitudinal relaxation rate $\\Gamma_1$ describes depolarization along the qubit quantization axis, often referred to as \u201cenergy decay\u201d or \u201cenergy relaxation.\u201d In this language, a qubit with polarization $p=1$ is entirely in the ground state $(\\lvert0\\rangle)$ at the north pole, $p=-1$ is entirely in the excited state $(\\lvert1\\rangle)$ at the south pole, and $p=0$ is a completely depolarized mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Bloch-sphere-noise)(b), longitudinal relaxation is caused by transverse noise, via the $x$- or $y$-axis, with the intuition that off-diagonal elements of an interaction Hamiltonian are needed to connect and drive transitions between states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1 \\rangle$.\n\nDepolarization occurs due to energy exchange with an environment, generally leading to both an \u201cup transition rate\u201d $\\Gamma_{1\\uparrow}$ (excitation from $|0 \\rangle$ to $|1 \\rangle$), and a \u201cdown transition rate\u201d $\\Gamma_{1\\downarrow}$  (relaxation from $|1 \\rangle$ to $|0 \\rangle$). Together, these form the longitudinal relaxation rate $\\Gamma_1$:\n$$\n\n\\Gamma_1 \\equiv \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\Gamma_{1\\downarrow} + \\Gamma_{1\\uparrow}.\n\n$$\n\n$T_1$ is the $1/e$ decay time in the exponential decay function in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), and it is the characteristic time scale over which qubit population will relax to its steady-state value. For superconducting qubits, this steady-state value is generally the ground state, due to Boltzmann statistics and typical operating conditions. Boltzmann equilibrium statistics lead to the \u201cdetailed balance\u201d relationship $\\Gamma_{1\\uparrow} = \\exp(-\\hbar \\freq / k_{\\mathrm{B}} T) \\Gamma_{1\\downarrow}$, where $T$ is the temperature and $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, with an equilibrium qubit polarization approaching $p=\\tanh (\\hbar \\freq / 2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)$. Typical qubits are designed at frequency $\\freq/2 \\pi \\approx 5$ GHz and are operated at dilution refrigerator temperatures $T \\approx 20$ mK. In this limit, the up-rate $\\Gamma_{1\\uparrow}$ is exponentially suppressed by the Boltzmann factor $\\exp(-\\hbar \\freq / k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)$, and so only the down-rate $\\Gamma_{1\\downarrow}$ contributes significantly, relaxing the population to the ground state. Thus, qubits generally spontaneously lose energy to their cold environment, but the environment rarely introduces a qubit excitation. As a result, the equilibrium polarization approaches unity [see Eq.\u00a0(<ref>)][Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nOnly noise at the qubit frequency mediates qubit transitions, whether absorption or emission, and this noise is generally \u201cwell behaved\u201d (short correlation time, many modes weakly coupled to qubit, no divergences) around the qubit frequency for superconducting qubits. The intuition is that qubit-transition linewidths are relatively narrow in frequency, and so the noise generally does not vary much over this narrow frequency range. Although there are a few notable exceptions, for example, qubit decay in the presence of hot quasiparticles[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which can lead to non-exponential decay functions, longitudinal depolarization measurements generally present exponential decay functions consistent with the Bloch-Redfield picture.\n\nAn example of a $T_1$ measurement is shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:T1-T2)(a). The qubit is prepared in its excited state using an $\\X{\\pi}$-pulse, and then left to spontaneously decay to the ground state for a time $\\tau$, after which the qubit is measured. A single measurement will project the quantum state into either state $\\lvert0\\rangle$ or state $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$, with probabilities that correspond to the qubit polarization. To make an estimate of this polarization, one needs to identically prepare the qubit and repeat the experiment many times. This is analogous to flipping a coin: any single flip will yield heads or tails, but the probability of obtaining a heads or tails can be estimated by flipping the coin many times and taking the ensemble average. The resulting exponential decay has a characteristic time $T_1 = 85$ $\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nPure dephasing\n\nThe pure dephasing rate $\\Gamma_{\\phi}$ describes depolarization in the $x-y$ plane of the Bloch sphere. It is referred to as \u201cpure dephasing,\u201d to distinguish it from other phase-breaking processes such as energy excitation or relaxation.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Bloch-sphere-noise)(c), pure dephasing is caused by longitudinal noise that couples to the qubit via the $z$-axis. Such longitudinal noise causes the qubit frequency $\\freq$ to fluctuate, such that it is no longer equal to the rotating frame frequency $\\omega_d$, and causes the Bloch vector to precess forward or backward in the rotating frame. Intuitively, we can imagine identically preparing several instances of the Bloch vector along the $x$-axis. For each instance, the stochastic fluctuations of qubit frequency will result in a different precession frequency, resulting in a net fanout of the Bloch vector in the $x-y$ plane. This eventually leads to a complete depolarization of the azimuthal angle $\\phi$. Note that this stochastic effect will be captured in the transverse relaxation rate $\\Gamma_2$ (next section); it is not the deterministic term $\\exp(\\pm i \\delta \\omega t)$ that appears in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), which represents intentional detuning of the qubit reference frame.\n\nThere are a few important distinctions between pure dephasing and energy relaxation. First, in contrast to energy relaxation, pure dephasing is not a resonant phenomenon; noise at any frequency can modify the qubit frequency and cause dephasing. Thus, qubit dephasing is subject to broadband noise. Second, since pure dephasing is elastic (there is no energy exchange with the environment), it is in principle reversible. That is, the dephasing can be \u201cundone\u201d \u2013 with quantum information being preserved \u2013 through the application of unitary operations, e.g., dynamical decoupling pulses[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], see Sec. <ref>.\n\nThe degree to which the quantum information can be retained depends on many factors, including the bandwidth of the noise, the rate of dephasing, the rate at which unitary operations can be performed, etc. This should be contrasted with spontaneous energy relaxation, which is an irreversible process. Intuitively, once the qubit emits energy to the environment and its myriad uncontrollable modes, the quantum information is essentially lost with no hope for its recovery and reconstitution back into the qubit.\n\nTransverse relaxation\n\nThe transverse relaxation rate $\\Gamma_2=\\Gamma_1/2 + \\Gamma_{\\varphi}$ describes the loss of coherence of a superposition state, for example $(1/\\sqrt{2})(\\lvert 0 \\rangle + \\lvert 1 \\rangle)$, pointed along the $x$-axis on the equator of the Bloch sphere as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Bloch-sphere-noise)(d). Decoherence is caused in part by longitudinal noise, which fluctuates the qubit frequency and leads to pure dephasing $\\Gamma_{\\varphi}$ (red). It is also caused by transverse noise, which leads to energy relaxation of the excited-state component of the superposition state at a rate $\\Gamma_1$ (blue). Such a relaxation event is also a phase-breaking process, because once it occurs, the Bloch vector points to the north pole, $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$, and there is no longer any knowledge of which direction the Bloch vector had been pointing along the equator; the relative phase of the superposition state is lost.\n\nTransverse relaxation $T_2$ can be measured using Ramsey interferometry, as shown and described in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:T1-T2)(b). The protocol positions the Bloch vector on the equator using a $X_{\\pi/2}$-pulse. Typically, the carrier frequency of this pulse is slightly detuned from the qubit frequency by an amount $\\delta \\omega$. As a result, the Bloch vector will precess around the $z$-axis at a rate $\\delta \\omega$. This is done for convenience sake, so that the resulting Ramsey measurement will oscillate, making it easier to analyze. After precessing for a time $\\tau$, a second $\\X{\\pi/2}$-pulse projects the Bloch vector back on to the $z$-axis. Repeated measurements are made to take an ensemble averaged estimate of the qubit polarization, as a function of $\\tau$. The resulting oscillations in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:T1-T2)(b) feature an approximately exponential decay function with time $T_2^* = 98$ $\\mu\\mathrm{s}$. The \u201c*\u201d indicates that the Ramsey experiment is sensitive to inhomogeneous broadening. That is, it is highly sensitive to quasi-static, low-frequency fluctuations that are constant within one experimental trial, but vary from trial to trial, e.g., due to $1/f$-type noise. This sensitivity to quasi-static noise is related to the corresponding $N=0$ noise filter function shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:T1-T2)(d) being centered at at zero-frequency, as described in more detail in Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\nThe Hahn echo shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:T1-T2)(c) is an experiment that is less sensitive to quasi-static noise. By placing a $Y_{\\pi}$ pulse at the center of a Ramsey interferometry experiment, the quasi-static contributions to dephasing can be \u201crefocused,\u201d leaving an estimate $T_{2E}$ that is less sensitive to inhomogeneous broadening mechanisms. The pulses are generally chosen to be resonant with the qubit transition for a Hahn echo, since any frequency detuning would be nominally refocused anyway. The resulting decay function in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:T1-T2)(c) is essentially exponential with time $T_{2E} = 120$ $\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nWith the known $T_1$ and $T_2$ times, one can infer the pure dephasing time $T_{\\varphi}$ from Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), provided the decay functions are exponential. In superconducting qubits, however, the broadband dephasing noise (e.g., flux noise, charge noise, critical-current noise, ...) tends to exhibit a $1/f$-like power spectrum. Such noise is singular near $\\omega = 0$, has long correlation times, and generally does not fall within the Bloch-Redfield description. The decay function of the off-diagonal terms in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) are generally non-exponential, and for such cases, the simple expression in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) is not applicable.\n\nModification due to $1/f$-type noise\n\nIf we assume that the qubit is coupled to many independent fluctuators, then, regardless of their individual statistics, they will in concert generate noise with a Gaussian distribution due to the central limit theorem. We therefore say that the longitudinal fluctuations exhibit Gaussian-distributed $1/f$ noise\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For $1/f$ noise spectra, the phase decay function is itself a Gaussian $\\exp \\left[ -(t/T_{\\varphi,\\mathrm{G}})^2 \\right]$, where we write $T_{\\varphi,\\mathrm{G}}$ to distinguish it from $T_{\\varphi}$ used in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). Furthermore, this function is separable from the $T_1$-type exponential decay, because the $T_1$-noise remains regular at the qubit frequency. The density matrix in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) becomes, following Refs.\u00a0IthierPhD2005,Bylander2011,\n\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:rho_1_f}\n\\rho %_{\\textrm{BR}} =\n= \\left(\n\\begin{matrix}\n1 + (|\\alpha|^2-1) e^{- \\Gamma_1 t} & \\alpha \\beta^* e^{i \\delta \\omega t} e^{- \\frac{\\Gamma_1}{2} t} e^{- \\chi_N (t)}  \\\\\n\\alpha^* \\beta e^{-i \\delta \\omega t} e^{- \\frac{\\Gamma_1}{2} t} e^{-\\chi_N (t)}  & |\\beta|^2 e^{- \\Gamma_1 t}\n\\end{matrix}\n\\right),\n\n$$\n\nwhere the decay function $\\langle \\exp(- \\chi_N(t)) \\rangle$ contains the coherence function $\\chi_N(t)$, which generalizes pure dephasing to include non-exponential decay functions. As we shall see later, the subscript $N$ labeling the decay function\n\nrefers to the number of $\\pi$-pulses used to refocus the low-frequency noise, which impacts the form of the decay function. Because the function is no longer purely exponential, we cannot formally write the transverse relaxation decay function as $\\exp(-t/T_2)$. However, an exponential decay remains a practically reasonable approximation for $T_{\\varphi} \\gtrsim T_1$. We also note that the energy decay component of the transverse relaxation is $\\exp(-t/2T_1)$, and so $T_2$ can never be larger than $2T_1$. In the absence of pure dephasing, the maximum $T_2=2T_1$ is reached.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nExamples of symmetric and asymmetric noise spectral densities. Noise at positive (negative) frequencies corresponds to the qubit emitting (absorbing) energy to (from) its environment. Thermal noise is proportional to temperature $T$ and carries essentially a white noise spectrum. As it represents a classical fluctuating parameter, such as electric current, the noise power spectral density is symmetric in frequency. When resonant with the qubit, it will drive both stimulated emission and absorption processes. The qubit may also spontaneously emit energy to its environment, represented as Nyquist noise[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], a quantum mechanical effect that is not symmetric in frequency. At sufficiently low temperatures or high frequencies, $\\hbar \\omega > 2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$, the Nyquist noise dominates thermal noise. Another common example is $1/f$ noise, which is also a classical noise fluctuation and symmetric in frequency.\n\nAs an example, consider the Ramsey interferometry data in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:T1-T2)(b). Since the dephasing is relatively weak, the transverse relaxation function as $\\exp(-t/T_2)$ is a reasonable fit and yields $T_2 = 95$ $\\mu \\mathrm{s}$. However, using the value $T_1 = 85$ $\\mu \\mathrm{s}$ from Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:T1-T2)(a) and dividing out $\\exp(-t/2T_1)$ from the data in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:T1-T2)(b), the remaining pure dephasing decay function is shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:T1-T2)(d) and assumes a Gaussian envelope $\\langle \\exp(- \\chi_N(t)) \\rangle = \\exp \\left[ -(t/T_{\\varphi,\\mathrm{G}} t)^2 \\right]$, with $T_{\\varphi,\\mathrm{G}} = 98$ $\\mu \\textrm{s}$. The Hahn echo data in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:T1-T2)(c) may be treated similarly.\n\nFor completeness, in addition to $1/f$ dephasing mechanisms, we note that there are also \u201cwhite\u201d pure dephasing mechanisms, which give rise to an exponential decay function for the dephasing component of $T_2$. One common example is dephasing due to the shot noise of residual photons in the readout resonator coupled to superconducting qubits, as we discuss in Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\n#### Noise power spectral density (PSD)\nThe frequency distribution of the noise power for a stationary noise source $\\lambda$ is characterized by its PSD $S_{\\lambda}(\\omega)$\n\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:PSD_defn}\nS_{\\lambda}(\\omega) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\tau \\; \\langle \\lambda(\\tau) \\lambda(0) \\rangle e^{- i \\omega \\tau}.\n\n$$\n\nThe Wiener-Khintchine theorem states that the PSD is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function $c_{\\lambda}(\\tau) = \\langle \\lambda(\\tau) \\lambda(0) \\rangle$ of the noise source $\\lambda$. Since the integration limits are $(-\\infty,\\infty)$, this is the bilateral PSD. Symmetrizing the PSD allows one to consider only positive frequencies, which is termed a unilateral PSD. Both unilateral and bilateral PSDs are used, often with the same notation, and so one needs to know how the PSD is defined, keep track of the factors of 2 and $\\pi$, and also be aware of the implications for quantum systems.\n\nFor classical systems, the noise power spectral density is symmetric. This is because the autocorrelation function of real signals is itself a real function, and the Fourier transform of a real temporal function is symmetric in the frequency domain. Dephasing noise is caused by real, fluctuating fields, and so its PSD is generally symmetric. Examples of such classical noise include thermal (Johnson) noise and $1/f$ noise[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:noise-PSD)).\n\nIn turn, the inverse Fourier transform of the PSD will yield the autocorrelation function:\n\n$$\n\nc_{\\lambda}(\\tau) &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\omega \\; S_{\\lambda}(\\omega) e^{ i \\omega \\tau}. %\\\\\n%\\sigma_{\\lambda}^2 \\equiv c_{\\lambda}(0) &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} d\\omega S_{\\lambda}(\\omega)\n\n$$\n\nThis implies that integrating the noise power spectral density with $\\tau=0$ yields the second moment of the noise, or, for zero-mean fluctuations, the variance.\n\nHowever, the autocorrelation function for a quantum system may be complex-valued due to the fact that quantum operators generally do not commute at different times. This means that time-ordering of the operators matters, and the PSD need not be symmetric in frequency. This is generally the case for transverse noise causing longitudinal energy relaxation. Noise at a positive frequency $S(\\freq)$ corresponds to energy transfer from the qubit to the environment, including both stimulated and spontaneous emission, associated with the down-rate $\\Gamma_{1\\downarrow}$. Noise at a negative frequency $S(-\\freq)$ corresponds to energy transfer to the qubit from the environment, associated with the up-rate $\\Gamma_{1\\uparrow}$. For a detailed discussion, see Refs.\u00a0Haus2000,Clerk2010. Spontaneous emission to a cold environment or electromagnetic vacuum, represented by Nyquist noise in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:noise-PSD), is an example of an asymmetric noise PSD[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn general, making a connection between $S_{\\lambda}(\\omega)$ and the measured qubit decay functions is the basis for noise spectroscopy up to second-order statistics\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The search for higher-order spectra related to non-Gaussian noise is a current topic of active research[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n### Common examples of noise\nThere are many sources of stochastic noise in superconducting qubits, and we refer the reader to Ref.\u00a0Oliver2013 for a review. Here, we briefly present several of the most common types of noise, their affect on coherence, and refer the reader to the references for a more detailed discussion.\n\n#### Charge noise\nCharge noise is ubiquitous in solid-state devices. It arises from charged fluctuators present in the defects or charge traps that reside in interfacial dielectrics, the junction tunnel barrier, and in the substrate itself. These are often modeled as an ensemble of fluctuating two-level systems or as bulk dielectric loss\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For example, in the case of a transmon qubit, the electric field between the capacitor plates traverses and couples to dielectric defects residing on the metal surfaces of the plates (for lateral-plate-type capacitors) or the capacitor dielectric between the plates (for parallel-plate-type capacitors). The electric field variable is transverse with respect to the quantization axis of the transmon qubit, which means that this noise is mainly responsible for energy relaxation ($T_1$). Additionally, if the $E_J/E_C$ ratio of the transmon is not made sufficiently large (smaller than around 60), the qubit frequency itself will also be sensitive to broadband charge fluctuations. In this case, low-frequency charge noise couples longitudinally to the transmon and causes pure dephasing ($T_{\\varphi}$).\n\nCharge noise is modeled primarily as a combination of inverse-frequency noise and Nyquist noise, also referred to as ohmic noise. At lower frequencies, the spectral density takes the form\n$$\n\\label{eqn:charge-1_f}\nS_Q(\\omega) = A_Q^2 \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi \\times 1\\mathrm{Hz}}{\\omega} \\right)^{\\gamma_Q},\n\n$$\nwith quasi-universal values $A_Q^2 = (10^{-3}e)^2/\\mathrm{Hz}$ at 1 Hz, and $\\gamma_Q \\approx 1$. In addition to large $1/f$ fluctuations, early charge qubits often witnessed discrete, charge offsets reminiscent of random telegraph noise. Together, these two mechanisms severely limited the utility of charge qubits, and served as a strong motivation to move to capacitively shunted charge qubits (transmons), which greatly reduced the qubit longitudinal sensitivity to charge noise. At higher frequencies, the power spectrum takes the form $S_Q(\\omega) = B_Q^2 [\\omega/ (2 \\pi \\times 1 \\mathrm{Hz})]$,\nwhere the noise strength $B_Q^2$ at 1 Hz can assume a range of values depending on the level of dissipation in the system. Likewise, the cross-over from $1/f$-like behavior to $f$-like behavior generally occurs at around 1 GHz, but will vary higher or lower between samples depending on the degree of dissipation[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n#### Magnetic flux noise\nAnother commonly observed noise in solid-state devices is magnetic flux noise.\nThe origin of this noise is understood to arise from the stochastic flipping of spins (magnetic dipoles) that reside on the surfaces of the superconducting metals comprising the qubit\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], resulting in random fluctuations of the effective magnetic field that biases flux-tunable qubits.\n\nFor example, in the case of the split transmon, the external magnetic field threading the loop couples longitudinally to the qubit and modulates the transition frequency via the Josephson energy $E_J$ (except at $\\varphi_e = 0$, where the qubit is first-order insensitive to magnetic-field fluctuations). Because the flux noise is longitudinal to the transmon, it contributes to pure dephasing ($T_{\\varphi}$). However, in the case of the flux qubit, and depending on the flux-bias point, the flux noise may be either longitudinal \u2013  causing dephasing $T_{\\varphi}$ \u2013 or it may couple transversely and thus contribute to $T_1$ relaxation\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe noise power spectrum of these fluctuations generally exhibits a \u201cquasi-universal\" dependence,\n$$\n\\label{eqn:charge-1_f}\nS_{\\Phi}(\\omega) = A_{\\Phi}^2 \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi \\times 1\\mathrm{Hz}}{\\omega} \\right)^{\\gamma_{\\Phi}},\n\n$$\nwith $\\gamma_{\\Phi} \\approx 0.8-1.0$ and $A_{\\Phi}^2 \\approx (1 \\; \\mu \\Phi_0)^2/\\mathrm{Hz}$, and has been shown to extend from less than millihertz to beyond gigahertz frequencies\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe large, low-frequency weighting of the $1/f$ power distribution enables the use of engineered error mitigation techniques \u2013 such as dynamical decoupling \u2013 to achieve better coherence\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and for improving single and two-qubit gate fidelity[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. It was recently demonstrated that $1/f$ flux noise is also a $T_1$-mechanism when extended out to the qubit frequency\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and one similarly expects a crossover to ohmic flux noise at high enough frequencies[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nAlthough much is known about the statistics and number of the defects presumed responsible for flux noise, their precise physical manifestation remains uncertain\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The fact that the $1/f$ noise is quasi-universal and largely independent of device, strongly suggests a common origin for the noise. Recent studies suggest that adsorbed molecular oxygen may be responsible for flux-noise\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nPhoton number fluctuations\n\nIn the circuit QED architecture, resonator photon number fluctuation is another major decoherence source\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Residual microwave fields in the cavity have photon-number fluctuations that in the dispersive regime impact the qubit through an interaction term $\\chi\\sigma_z n$, see Sec. <ref>, leading to a frequency shift $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{Stark}}=2\\eta \\chi \\bar{n}$, where $\\bar{n}$ is the average photon number, and $\\eta=\\kappa^2/(\\kappa^2 + 4\\chi^2)$ effectively scales the photon population seen by the qubit due to the interplay between the qubit-induced dispersive shift of the resonator frequency ($\\chi$) and the resonator decay rate ($\\kappa$).\n\nIn the dispersive limit, the noise is longitudinally coupled to the qubit and leads to pure dephasing at a rate,\n$$\n\n\\Gamma_{\\phi} = \\eta \\frac{4 \\chi^2}{\\kappa} \\bar{n}.\n\n$$\nThe fluctuations originate from residual photons in the resonator, typically due to radiation from higher temperature stages in the dilution refrigerator\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The corresponding noise spectral density is of a Lorentzian type,\n$$\n\nS(\\omega) = 4 \\chi^2 \\frac{2\\eta\\bar{n}\\kappa}{\\omega^2+\\kappa^2},\n\n$$\nwhich exhibits an essentially white noise spectrum up to a $3\\mathrm{dB}$ cutoff frequency $\\omega = \\kappa$ set by the resonator decay rate $\\kappa$, see Ref.\u00a0Yan2016.\n\n#### Quasiparticles\nQuasiparticles, i.e. unpaired electrons, are another important noise source for superconducting devices\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The tunneling of quasiparticles through a qubit junction may lead to both $T_1$ relaxation and pure dephasing $T_{\\varphi}$, depending on the type of qubit, the bias point, and the junction through which the tunneling event occurs\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nQuasiparticles are naturally excited due to thermodynamics, and the quasiparticle density in equilibrium superconductors should be exponentially suppressed as temperature decreases. However, below about 150 mK, the quasiparticle density observed in superconducting devices \u2013 generally in the range $10^{-8}-10^{-6}$ per Cooper pair \u2013 is much higher than BCS theory would predict for a superconductor in equilibrium with its cryogenic environment at 10 mK. The reason for this excess quasiparticle population is unclear, but it is very likely related to the presence of additional, non-thermal mechanisms that increase the generation rates, \u201cbottleneck effects\u201d that occur at millikelvin temperatures to reduce recombination rates, or a combination of both.\n\nIt has been shown that the observed $T_1$ and excess excited-state population measured in today's state-of-the-art high-coherence transmon are self-consistent with excess \u201chot\u201d nonequilibrium quasiparticles at the quasi-universal density of around $10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ per Cooper pair[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Although this quasiparticle generation mechanism is not yet well understood, it has been shown that quasiparticles can be transiently pumped away, improving $T_1$ times and reducing $T_1$ temporal variation\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n### Operator form of qubit-environment interaction\nSimilar to the way that two qubits are coupled, a qubit may couple and interact with uncontrolled degrees of freedom (DOF) in its environment (the noise sources). The interaction Hamiltonian between the qubit DOF ($\\hat{O}_q$) and those of the noise source ($\\hat{\\lambda}$) may be expressed in a general form\n\n$$\n\n\\hat{H}_{\\text{int}} = \\nu \\hat{O}_q\\hat{\\lambda} %\\rightarrow \\frac{d\\hat{H}}{d\\lambda} \\delta \\lambda,\n\\label{Eq:HintNoise}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\nu$ denotes the coupling strength \u2013 which is related to the sensitivity of the qubit to environmental fluctuations $\\partial\\hat{H}_q / \\partial\\lambda$\n\u2013 and we assume that $\\hat{O}_q$ is a qubit operator\nwithin the qubit Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_q$. The noisy environment represented by the operator $\\hat{\\lambda}$ produces fluctuations $\\delta \\lambda$. Note that we retained the hats in this section to remind us that these are quantum operators.\n\nConnecting $T_1$ to $S(\\omega)$\n\nIf the coupling is transverse to the qubit, e.g. $\\hat{O}_q$ is of the type $\\sigma_{x}$ or $(a + a^{\\dagger})$ \u2013 see the related case of qubit-qubit coupling treated in Sec. <ref> \u2013 then noise at the qubit frequency can cause transitions between the qubit eigenstates. Since this is a stochastic process, the ensemble-average manifests itself as a decay (usually exponential) of the qubit population\ntowards a certain equilibrium value (usually the qubit ground state $|0\\rangle$ for $k_B T \\ll \\hbar \\freq$). Again, this process is equivalently referred to as \u201c$T_1$ relaxation\", \u201cenergy relaxation\", or \u201clongitudinal relaxation\". As stated above, $T_1$ is the characteristic time scale of the decay. Its inverse, $\\Gamma_1 = 1/T_{1}$ is called the relaxation rate and depends on the power spectral density of the noise $S(\\omega)$ at the transition frequency of the qubit $\\omega = \\freq$:\n\n$$\n\n%\\label{Eq:Gamma1}\n\\Gamma_{1} = \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\left| \\langle 0 | \\frac{\\partial \\hat{H}_q}{\\partial\\lambda} | 1 \\rangle \\right|^2 S_{\\lambda} (\\freq),\n%&= \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\hbar} \\left| \\langle \\d\\hat{H}_q / d\\lambda \\rangle \\right|^2 |\\delta \\lambda|^2 \\; \\rho(\\hbar \\freq) \\\\\n\\label{Eq:Gamma1-PSD}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\partial\\hat{H}_q / \\partial\\lambda$ is the qubit transverse susceptibility to fluctuations $\\delta \\lambda$, such that $|\\delta \\lambda|^2$\nis the ensemble average value of the environmental noise sources as seen by the qubit.\n\nEq.\u00a0(<ref>) is equivalent to Fermi's Golden Rule,\nin which the qubit's transverse susceptibility to noise\nis driven by the noise power spectral density.\n\nThe qubit transverse susceptibility can be used to calculate the prefactors; for example, for fluctuations $\\delta \\lambda = \\delta n$, the relevant term in the transmon Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) is $4E_C(\\hat{n} - n_g)^2$, where we allow for an offset charge $n_g$, and the susceptibility is given by $8 E_C\\hat{n}$.\nWe refer the reader to Refs. You2007,Kerman2008,Oliver2013b for more details.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDynamical error suppression.\n\n(a) Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence applies $N$ equally spaced $\\pi$ pulses within an otherwise free-evolution time $\\tau$. Pulses in the time domain correspond to bandpass filters in the frequency domain (lower panel) which serve to shape the noise power spectrum seen by the qubit. The centroid of the bandpass filter shifts to higher frequencies as $N$ is increased. For noise that decreases with frequency, such as $1/f$ noise, larger $N$ corresponds to less integrated noise impinging on the qubit.\n\n(b) CPMG pulse sequence applied to a flux qubit biased at a point that is highly sensitive to $1/f$ flux noise. The Ramsey $(N=0)$ time is approximately 300 ns, and the Hahn echo $(N=1)$ time is approximately $1.5$ $\\mu \\mathrm{s}$. Increasing the number of CPMG pulses continues to increase the effective $T_2$ time towards the $2T_1$ limit. Adapted from Ref.\u00a0Bylander2011.\n\nConnecting $T_{\\varphi}$ to $S(\\omega)$\n\nIf the coupling to the qubit is instead longitudinal, e.g. $\\hat{H}_q$ is of the type $\\sigma_z$ or $a^{\\dagger}a$, the noise will stochastically modulate the transition frequency of the qubit and thereby  introduce a stochastic phase evolution of a qubit superposition state. This gradually leads to a loss of phase information, and it is therefore called pure dephasing (time constant $T_{\\varphi}$). Unlike $T_1$ relaxation, which is generally an irreversible (incoherent) error, pure dephasing $T_{\\varphi}$ is in principle reversible (a coherent error). The degree of pure dephasing depends on the control pulse sequence applied while the qubit is subject to the noise process.\n\nConsider the relative phase $\\varphi$ of a superposition state undergoing free evolution in the presence of noise.\nThe superposition state's accumulated phase,\n$$\n\n\\varphi(t) = \\int_0^t \\omega_{q} dt' = \\langle\\omega_{\\mathrm{q}}\\rangle t + \\delta\\varphi(t)\n\n$$\ndiffuses due to adiabatic fluctuations of the transition frequency,\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:del_phi_defn}\n\\delta\\varphi(t) = \\frac{\\partial \\freq}{\\partial \\lambda} \\int_0^t \\delta\\lambda(t')\\mathrm{d}t',\n\n$$\nwhere $\\partial \\freq / \\partial \\lambda = (1/\\hbar) |\\langle \\partial\\hat{H}_q / \\partial\\lambda \\rangle |$ is the qubit's longitudinal sensitivity to $\\lambda$-noise.\n\nFor noise generated by a large number of fluctuators that are weakly coupled to the qubit, its statistics are Gaussian.\nEnsemble averaging over all realizations of the Gaussian-distributed stochastic process $\\delta\\lambda(t)$,\n\nthe dephasing is\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:ens_avg_phase}\n\\langle e^{i\\,\\delta\\varphi(t)} \\rangle = e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\langle \\delta\\varphi^2(t) \\rangle} \\equiv e^{-\\chi_N(t)},\n\n$$\nleading to a coherence decay function,\n\n$$\n\n\\langle e^{- \\chi_N(\\tau)} \\rangle = \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\tau^2}{2} \\frac{\\partial \\freq}{\\partial\\lambda} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}g_N(\\omega,\\tau)S(\\omega)d\\omega\\right],\n\\label{Eq:PureDephasing}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $g(\\omega,\\tau)$ is a dimensionless weighting function.\n\nThe function $g_N(\\omega,\\tau)$ can be viewed as a frequency-domain filter of the noise $S_{\\lambda}(\\omega)$ [see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:CPMG)(a)].\nIn general, its filter properties depend on the number $N$ and distribution of applied pulses. For example, considering sequences of $\\pi$-pulses\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ],\n\n$$\n\\label{eq:filter_def}\ng_N(\\omega,\\tau) =\n\\frac{1}{(\\omega\\tau)^2} \\, \\Big| 1+(-1)^{1+N}\\exp(i\\omega\\tau) + \\\\\n2\\sum_{j=1}^{N} (-1)^j \\exp(i\\omega\\delta_j\\tau) \\cos(\\omega\\tau_\\pi/2) \\Big|^2 ,\n%   g=\\frac{|y_N(\\omega,\\tau)|^2}{(\\omega\\tau)^2},\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\delta_j \\in [0,1]$ is the normalized position of the centre of the $j$th $\\pi$-pulse between the two $\\pi/2$-pulses, $\\tau$ is the total free-induction time, and $\\tau_\\pi$ is the length of each $\\pi$-pulse\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], yielding a total sequence length $\\tau + N\\tau_\\pi$.\n\nAs the number of pulses increases for fixed $\\tau$, the filter function's peak shifts to higher frequencies, leading to a reduction in the net integrated noise for $1/f^{\\alpha}$-type noise spectra with $\\alpha > 0$.\n\nSimilarly, for a fixed $N$, the filter function will shift in frequency with $\\tau$.\n\nAdditionally, for a fixed time separation $\\tau' = \\tau/N$ (valid for $N \\ge 1$), the filter sharpens and asymptotically peaks at $\\omega'/2\\pi = 1/2\\tau'$ as more pulses are added. $g_N(\\omega,\\tau)$ is thus called the \u201cfilter function\u201d\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and it depends on the pulse sequences being applied.\n\nFrom Eq. (<ref>), the pure dephasing decay arises from a noise spectral density that is \u201cshaped\u201d or \u201cfiltered\u201d by the sequence-specific filter function. By choosing the number of pulses, their rotation axes, and their arrangement in time, we can design filter functions that minimize the net noise power for a given noise spectral density within the experimental constraints of the experiment (e.g., pulse-modulation bandwidth of the electronics used to control the qubits).\n\nTo give a standard example, we compare the coherence integral for two cases: a Ramsey pulse sequence and a Hahn echo pulse sequence. Both sequences involve two $\\pi/2$ pulses separated by a time $\\tau$, during which free evolution of the qubit occurs in the presence of low-frequency dephasing noise. The distinction is that the Hahn echo will place a single $\\pi$ pulse ($N=1$) in the middle of the free-evolution period, whereas the Ramsey does not use any additional pulses ($N=0$). The resulting filter functions are:\n\n$$\n\n%\\langle e^{- \\chi_N(\\tau)} \\rangle = \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\tau^2 \\nu^2}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}g(\\omega,\\tau)S(\\omega)d\\omega\\right],\ng_0(\\omega,\\tau) &= \\text{sinc}^2 \\frac{\\omega \\tau}{2} \\\\\ng_1(\\omega,\\tau) &= \\sin^2 \\frac{\\omega \\tau}{4} \\text{sinc}^2 \\frac{\\omega \\tau}{4}\n\n$$\n\nwhere the subscript $N=0$ and $N=1$ indicate the number of $\\pi$-pulses applied for the Ramsey and Hahn echo experiments, respectively. The filter function $g_0(\\omega,\\tau)$ for the Ramsey case is a sinc-function centered at $\\omega=0$. For noise that decreases with frequency, e.g., $1/f$ flux noise in superconducting qubits, the Ramsey experiment windows through the noise in $S(\\omega)$ where it has its highest value. This is the worst choice of filter function for $1/f$ noise. In contrast, the Hahn echo filter function has a centroid that is peaked at a higher frequency, away from $\\omega=0$. In fact, it has zero value at $\\omega=0$. For noise that decreases with frequency, such as $1/f$ noise, this is advantageous. This concept extends to larger numbers $N$ of $\\pi$ pulses, and is called a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:CPMG)(b), the $T_2$ time of a qubit under the influence of strong dephasing noise is increased toward the $2T_1$ limit using a CPMG dynamical error-suppression pulse sequence with an increasing number of pulses, $N$. We refer the reader to Refs.\u00a0Bylander2011,Gustavsson2012a,Gustavsson2012b, where these experiments were performed with superconducting qubits.\n\nNoise spectroscopy\n\nThe qubit is highly sensitive to its noisy environment, and this feature can be used to map out the noise power spectral density. In general, one can map the noise PSD during free evolution \u2013 periods of time for which no control is applied to the qubit, except for very short dynamical decoupling pulses \u2013 and during driven evolution \u2013 periods of time during which the control fields are applied to the qubit. Both free-evolution and driven-evolution noise is important to characterize, as the noise PSD may differ for these two types of evolution, and both are utilized in the context of universal quantum computation. We refer the reader to Ref.\u00a0Yan2013 for a summary of noise spectroscopy during both types of evolution.\n\nThe Ramsey frequency itself is sensitive to longitudinal noise, and monitoring its fluctuations is one means to map out the noise spectral density over the sub-millihertz to $\\sim100$ Hz range[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nAt higher frequencies, the CPMG dynamical decoupling sequence can be used to create narrow-band filters that \u201csample\u201d the noise at different frequencies as a function of the free-evolution time $\\tau$ and the number of pulses $N$. This has been used to map out the noise PSD in the range 0.1 - 300 MHz\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nOne must be careful of the additional small peaks at higher-frequencies, which all contribute to the dephasing used to perform the noise spectroscopy[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn fact, using pulse envelopes such as Slepians[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] \u2013 which are designed to have concentrated frequency response \u2013 to perform noise spectroscopy is one means to reduce such errors[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nAt even higher frequencies, measurements of $T_1$ can be used in conjunction with Fermi's golden rule to map out the transverse noise spectrum above 1 GHz\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe aforementioned are all examples of noise spectroscopy during free evolution. Noise spectroscopy during driven evolution was also demonstrated using a \u201cspin-locking\u201d technique, where a strong drive along $x$ or $y$ axes defines a new qubit quantization axis, whose Rabi frequency is the new qubit frequency in the spin-locking frame. The spin-locking frame is then used to infer the noise spectrum while the qubit is continually subject to a driving field. For more information, we refer the reader to Ref.\u00a0Yan2013.\n\n### Engineering noise mitigation\nHere, we briefly review a few examples of techniques that have been developed to reduce noise or reduce its impact on decoherence (sensitivity). We stress that improving gate fidelity is a comprehensive optimization task, one that is full of trade-offs. It is thus important to identify what the limiting factors are, what price we have to pay to diminish these limiting factors, and what advantage we can achieve until reaching a better trade-off. These all require an accurate understanding the limitations on the gate fidelity, the sources of decoherence, the properties of the noise, and how it affects the system performance.\n\n#### Materials and fabrication improvements\nNumerous efforts have been undertaken to reduce noise-induced defects due to materials and fabrication\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In the case of charge noise, significant efforts have been made\nto reduce the number of defects, such as substrate cleaning\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], substrate annealing\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and trenching\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn the case of flux noise, several groups have performed experiments to characterize the behavior and properties of magnetic-flux defects\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. More recently, a number of groups have tried optical surface treatments to remove these defects\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn the context of residual quasiparticles, it has been shown that adding quasiparticle traps to the circuit design can reduce the quasiparticle number, particularly in devices that create excess quasiparticles, such as classical digital logic or operation in the presence of thermal radiation\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n\n#### Design improvements\nAnother strategy is to reduce qubit sensitivity to the noise by design. A qubit can only lose energy to defects if it couples to them. It has been demonstrated that altering the capacitor geometry to increase the electric-field mode volume reduces the electric field density in the thin dielectric regions that cause loss. This effectively reduces the \u201cparticipation\u201d of the defects and makes the qubits less senstivie to these noise sources.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn another example, the split transmons built using asymmetric junctions have lower sensitivity to flux noise than their symmetric counterparts at the expense of decreased frequency tunability\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This is a good trade-off to make, because generally one is interested in tuning the qubit frequency over a somewhat restricted range (typically around 1 GHz) about the qubit frequency. When such asymmetric transmons are used in a gate scheme such as the adiabatic -gate[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], (see Sec.<ref>) the qubit is less sensitive to flux noise, has a lower dephasing rate, and this should improve the gate fidelity in general.\n\n#### Dynamical error suppression\nAs introduced in the previous section, it is advantageous to leverage the $1/\\omega$ distribution of flux noise, wherein a considerable amount of the noise power resides at low frequencies, and so the noise is \u201cquasi-static\u201d.\n\nThe spin-echo technique\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which disrupts the free evolution by a $\\pi$-pulse, is extremely effective in mitigating the pure dephasing by refocusing the coherent phase dispersion due to low-frequency noise.\n\nThe more advanced versions, such as the CPMG-sequence, use multiple $\\pi$-pulses to interrupt the system more frequently, pushing the filter band to even higher frequencies \u2013 a technique known as dynamical decoupling[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nReturning to excess quasiparticles, it has been shown that quasiparticles can be stochastically pumped away from the qubit region, resulting in longer, and more stable $T_1$ times\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Although the pumping technique uses a series of $\\pi$-pulses, this technique differs from dynamical error suppression of coherent errors in that pulses are stochastically applied, and that it addresses incoherent errors ($T_1$).\n\n#### Cryogenic engineering\nIn the case of photon shot-noise, in addition to applying dynamical decoupling techniques, there have been several recent works aimed at reducing the thermal photon flux that reaches the device. This include optimizing the attenuation of the cryogenic setup\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], remaking the cryogenic attenuators with more efficient heat sinking\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], adding absorptive \u201cblack\u201d material to absorb stray thermal photons\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and adding additional cavity filters for thermalization\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nQUBIT CONTROL\n\nIn this section, we will introduce how superconducting qubits are manipulated to implement quantum algorithms. Since the transmon-like variety of superconducting qubits has so far been the most widely deployed modality for implementing quantum programs, the discussion throughout this section will be focused on modern techniques for transmons. Nonetheless, the techniques introduced here are applicable to all types of superconducting qubits.\n\nWe start with a brief review of the gates used in classical computing as well as quantum computing, and the concept of universality. Subsequently we discuss the most common technique of driving single qubit gates via a capacitive coupling of a microwave line, coupled to the qubit. We introduce the notion of \u201cvirtual $\\Z{}$ gates\" and \u201cDRAG\" pulsing. In the latter part of this section, we review some of the most common implementations of two-qubit gates in both tunable and fixed-frequeny transmon qubits. The single-qubit and two-qubit operations together form the basis of many of the medium-scale superconducting quantum processors that exist today.\n\nThroughout this section, we write everything in the computational basis $\\{|0\\rangle,|1\\rangle\\}$ where $|0\\rangle$ is the $+1$ eigenstate of $\\sigma_z$ and $|1\\rangle$ is the $-1$ eigenstate. We use capitalized serif-fonts to indicate the rotation operator of a qubit state, e.g. rotations around the $x$-axis by an angle $\\theta$ is written as\n$$\n\n\\X{\\theta} = R_X(\\theta) = e^{-i\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\sigma_x} = \\cos(\\theta/2) \\mathds{1}-i\\sin(\\theta/2) \\sigma_x\n\n$$\nand we use the shorthand notation `$\\X{}$' for a full $\\pi$ rotation about the $x$ axis (and similarly for $\\Y{} := \\Y{\\pi}$ and $\\Z{} := \\Z{\\pi}$).\n\nBoolean logic gates used in classical computers\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nClassical single-bit and two-bit boolean logic gates. For each gate, the name, a short description, circuit representation, and input/output truth tables are presented. The numerical values in the truth table correspond to the classical bit values $0$ and $1$. Adapted from Ref.\u00a0MITxPRO.\n\nUniversal boolean logic can be implemented on classical computers using a small set of single-bit and two-bit gates. Several common classical logic gates are shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Classical-logic-gates) along with their truth tables. In classical boolean logic, bits can take on one of two values: state $0$ or state $1$. The state $0$ represents logical , and state $1$ represents logical .\n\nBeyond the trivial \u201cidentity operation,\u201d which simply passes a boolean bit unchanged, the only other possible single-bit boolean logic gate is the  gate. As shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Classical-logic-gates), the  gate flips the bit: $0 \\rightarrow 1$ and $1 \\rightarrow 0$. This gate is reversible, because it is trivial to determine the input bit value given the output bit values. As we will see, for two-bit gates, this is not the case.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nQuantum single-qubit gates. For each gate, the name, a short description, circuit representation, matrix representation, input/output truth tables, and Bloch sphere represenation are presented. Matrices are defined in the basis spanned by the state vectors $\\vert 0 \\rangle \\equiv [ 1 \\; 0 ]^T$ and $\\vert 1 \\rangle \\equiv [ 0 \\; 1 ]^T$. The numerical values in the truth table correspond to the quantum states $\\vert 0 \\rangle$ and $\\vert 1 \\rangle$. Adapted from Ref.\u00a0MITxPRO.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nQuantum two-qubit gates: the controlled NOT () gate and the controlled phase ( or ). For each gate, the name, a short description, circuit representation, matrix representation, and input/output truth tables are presented. Matrices are defined in the basis spanned by the two-qubit state vectors $\\vert 00 \\rangle \\equiv [ 1 \\; 0 \\; 0 \\; 0 ]^T$, $\\vert 01 \\rangle \\equiv [ 0 \\; 1 \\; 0 \\; 0 ]^T$, $\\vert 10 \\rangle \\equiv [ 0 \\; 0 \\; 1 \\; 0 ]^T$, and $\\vert 11 \\rangle \\equiv [ 0 \\; 0 \\; 0 \\; 1 ]^T$, where the first qubit is the control qubit, and the second qubit is the target qubit. The  gate flips the state of the target qubit conditioned on the control qubit being in state $\\vert 1 \\rangle$. The  gate applies a $\\Z{}$ gate to the target qubit conditioned on the control qubit being in state $\\vert 1 \\rangle$. Adapted from Ref.\u00a0MITxPRO.\n\nThere are several two-bit gates shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Classical-logic-gates). A two-bit gate takes two bits as inputs, and it passes as an output the result of a boolean operation. One common example is the  gate, for which the output is $1$ if and only if both inputs are $1$; otherwise, the output is $0$. The  gate, and the other two-bit gates shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Classical-logic-gates), are all examples of irreversible gates; that is, the input bit values cannot be inferred from the output values. For example, for the  gate, an output of logical $1$ uniquely identifies the input $11$, but an output of $0$ could be associated with $00$, $01$, or $10$. Once the operation is performed, in general, it cannot be \u201cundone\u201d and the input information is lost.\n\nThere are several variants of two-bit gates, including,\n\n*  and ;\n\n*  (a combination of  and ) and  (a combination of  and );\n\n*  (exclusive ) and  ().\n\nThe  gate is interesting, because it is a parity gate. That is, it returns a logical $0$ if the two inputs are the same values (i.e., they have the same parity), and it returns a logical $1$ if the two inputs have different values (i.e., different parity). Still, the  and  gates are not reversible, because knowledge of the output does not allow one to uniquely identify the input bit values.\n\nThe concept of universality refers to the ability to perform any boolean logic algorithm using a small set of single-bit and two-bit gates. A universal gate set can in principle transform any state to any other state in the state space represented by the classical bits. The set of gates which enable universal computation is not unique, and may be represented by a small set of gates. For example, the  gate and the  gate together form a universal gate set. Similarly, the  gate itself is universal, as is the  gate. The efficiency with which one can implement arbitrary boolean logic, of course, depends on the choice of the gate set.\n\nQuantum logic gates used in quantum computers\n\nQuantum logic can similarly be performed by a small set of single-qubit and two-qubit gates. Qubits can of course assume the classical states $\\vert 0 \\rangle$ and $\\vert 1 \\rangle$, at the north pole and south pole of the Bloch sphere, but they can also assume arbitrary superpositions $\\alpha \\vert 0 \\rangle + \\beta \\vert 1 \\rangle$, corresponding to any other position on the sphere.\n\nSingle-qubit operations translate an arbitrary quantum state from one point on the Bloch sphere to another point by rotating the Bloch vector (spin) a certain angle about a particular axis. As shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Quantum-logic-gates-single), there are several single-qubit operations, each represented by a matrix that describes the quantum operation in the computational basis represented by the eigenvectors of the $\\sigma_z$ operator, i.e. $\\vert 0 \\rangle \\equiv [ 1 \\; 0 ]^T$ and $\\vert 1 \\rangle \\equiv [ 0 \\; 1 ]^T$.\n\nFor example, the identity gate performs no rotation on the state of the qubit. This is represented by a two-by-two identity matrix. The $\\X{}$-gate performs a $\\pi$ rotation about the $x$ axis. Similarly, the $\\Y{}$-gate and $\\Z{}$-gate perform a $\\pi$ rotation about the $y$ axis and $z$ axis, respectively. The $\\textsf{S}$-gate performs a $\\pi/2$ rotation about the $z$ axis, and the $\\text{T}$-gate performs a rotation of $\\pi/4$ about the $z$ axis. The Hadamard gate $\\textsf{H}$ is also a common single-qubit gate the performs a $\\pi$ rotation about an axis diagonal in the $x$-$z$ plane, see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Quantum-logic-gates-single).\n\nTwo-qubit quantum-logic gates are generally conditional gates and take two qubits as inputs. Typically, the first qubit is the control qubit, and the second is the target qubit. A unitary operator is applied to the target qubit, dependent on the state of the control qubit. The two common examples shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Quantum-logic-gates-coupled) are the controlled NOT (-gate) and controlled phase ( or  gate). The -gate flips the state of the target qubit conditioned on the control qubit being in state $\\vert 1 \\rangle$. The -gate applies a $\\Z{}$ gate to the target qubit, conditioned on the control qubit being in state $\\vert 1 \\rangle$. As we will shown later, the $i\\textsf{SWAP}$ gate \u2013 another two-qubit gate \u2013 can be built from the -gate and single-qubit gates.\nThe unitary operator of the $\\CNOT{}$ gate can be written in a useful way, highlighting that it applies an $\\X{}$ depending on the state of the control qubit.\n$$\n\nU_\\CNOT{} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} = |0\\rangle\\langle  0| \\otimes \\mathds{1} + |1\\rangle\\langle 1| \\otimes \\X{} \\label{eq:UCNOT}\n\n$$\nand similarly for the $\\CPHASE{}$ gate,\n$$\n\nU_\\CPHASE{} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} = |0\\rangle\\langle  0| \\otimes \\mathds{1} + |1\\rangle\\langle 1| \\otimes \\Z{}\n\\label{eq:UCPHASE}\n\n$$\nComparing the last equality above with the unitary for the  [<ref>], it is clear that the two gates are closely related. Indeed, a  can be generated from a  by applying two Hadamard gates,\n$$\n\nU_\\CNOT{} = (\\Id \\otimes \\H{})U_\\CPHASE(\\Id \\otimes \\H{}),\n\n$$\nsince $\\H{}\\Z{}\\H{} = \\X{}$. Due to the form of <ref>, the  gate is also denoted the  gate, since it applies a controlled $\\Z{}$ operator, by analogy with  (a controlled application of $\\X{}$ operator). Inspection of the definition of  in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Quantum-logic-gates-coupled) makes no distinction between which qubit acts as the target and which as the control and, consequently, the circuit-diagram is sometimes drawn in a symmetric fashion\n$$\n\n\\CPHASE{}=\\begin{minipage}{0.05\\textwidth}\n\\begin{flushleft}\n\\mbox{\\Qcircuit @C=0.5em @R=0.75em{\n& \\ctrl{1} &  \\qw \\\\\n& \\ctrl{-1} & \\qw \\\n}}\n\\end{flushleft}\n\\end{minipage}\n\n$$\nThe  in terms of  can then be realized as\n$$\n\n\\CNOT{}=\n\\begin{minipage}{0.05\\textwidth}\n\\begin{flushleft}\n\\mbox{\\Qcircuit @C=0.5em @R=0.75em{\n& \\qw &\\ctrl{1} &  \\qw  & \\qw \\\\\n& \\gate{\\H{}} &\\ctrl{-1} & \\gate{\\H{}} & \\qw \\\n}}\n\\end{flushleft}\n\\end{minipage}\\label{eq:CNOTfromCPHASE}\n\n$$\n\nSome two-qubit gates such as  and  are also called entangling gates, because they can take product states as inputs and output entangled states. They are thus an indispensable component of a universal gate set for quantum logic. For example, consider two qubits $A$ and $B$ in the following state:\n\n$$\n\n\\vert \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left(\\vert 0 \\rangle + \\vert 1 \\rangle\\right)_A \\vert 0 \\rangle_B.\n\n$$\n\nIf we perform a  gate, $U_{\\CNOT}$, on this state, with qubit A the control qubit, and qubit B the target qubit, the resulting state is (see the truth table in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Quantum-logic-gates-coupled)):\n\n$$\n\nU_{\\CNOT} \\vert \\psi \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left(\\vert 0 \\rangle_A \\vert 0 \\rangle_B + \\vert 1 \\rangle_A \\vert 1 \\rangle_B \\right) \\neq ( \\ldots)_A ( \\ldots)_B,\n\n$$\nwhich is a state that cannot be factored into an isolated qubit-A component and a qubit-B component. This is one of the two-qubit entangled Bell states, a manifestly quantum mechanical state.\n\nA universal set of single-qubit and two-qubit gates is sufficient to implement arbitrary quantum logic. This means that this gate set can in principle reach any state in the multi-qubit state-space. How efficiently this is done depends on the choice of quantum gates that comprise the gate set. We also note that each of the single-qubit and two-qubit gates is reversible, that is, given the output state, one can uniquely determine the input state. As we discuss further, this distinction between classical and quantum gates arises, because quantum gates are based on unitary operations $U$. If a unitary operation $U$ is a particular gate applied to a qubit, then its hermitian conjugate $U^{\\dagger}$ can be applied to recover the original state, since $U^{\\dagger}U=I$ resolves an identity operation.\n\nComparing classical and quantum gates\n\nThe gate-sequences used to represent quantum algorithms have certain similarities to those used in classical computing, with a few striking differences. As an example, we consider first the classical  gate (discussed previously), and the related quantum circuit version, shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:ClassicalVQuantum_circuits).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nComparison of the classical inverter () gate and quantum bit flip () gate. (a) The classical  gate that inverts the state of a classical bit. (b) The quantum  gate, which flips the amplitudes of the two components of a quantum bit.\n\nWhile the classic bit-flip gate inverts any input state, the quantum bit-flip does not in general produce the antipodal state (when viewed on the Bloch sphere), but rather exchange the prefactors of the wavefunction written in the computational basis. The $\\mathsf{X}$ operator is sometimes referred to as `the quantum NOT' (or `quantum bit-flip`), but we note that  only acts similar to the classical  gate in the case of classical data stored in the quantum bit, i.e. $\\textsf{X}|g\\rangle = |\\bar g\\rangle$ for $g\\in\\{0,1\\}$.\n\nAs briefly mentioned in Sec.\u00a0<ref>, all quantum gates are reversible, due to the underlying unitary nature of the operators implementing the logical operations. Certain other processes used in quantum information processing, however, are irreversible. Namely, measurements (see Sec.\u00a0<ref> for detailed discussion) and energy loss to the the environment (if the resulting state of the environment is not known). Here, we will not consider how these processes are modeled, but refer the interested reader to e.g. Ref.\u00a0NielsenChuang, and will only consider unitary control operations throughout the rest of this section. Finally, we note that quantum circuits are written left-to-right (in order of application), while the calculation of the result of a gate-sequences, e.g the circuit\n$$\n\n\\Qcircuit @C=1em @R=2em{\n\\lstick{|\\psi_\\text{in}\\rangle} & \\gate{U_0} & \\gate{U_1} & \\qw & \\cdots & & \\gate{U_n} & \\rstick{|\\psi_\\text{out}\\rangle} \\qw\\\\\n}\n\\label{eq:simplecirc}\n\n$$\nis performed right-to-left, i.e.\n$$\n\n|\\psi_\\text{out}\\rangle = U_n \\cdots U_1U_0 |\\psi_\\text{in}\\rangle.\n\n$$\nAs discussed in Sec.\u00a0<ref>, the  and  gates are each individually universal gates for classical computing. Since both of these gates have no direct quantum analogue (because they are not reversible), it is natural to ask which gates are needed to build a universal quantum computer. It turns out that the ability to rotate about arbitrary axes on the Bloch-sphere (i.e. a complete single-qubit gate set), supplemented with any entangling 2-qubit operation will suffice for universality [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. By using what is known as the `Krauss-Cirac decomposition', any two-qubit gate can be decomposed into a series of  operations [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nGate sets and gate synthesis\n\nA common universal quantum gate set is\n$$\n\n\\mathcal G_0 = \\{\\X{\\theta},\\Y{\\theta},\\Z{\\theta},\\text{Ph}_\\theta,\\CNOT{}\\}\n\n$$\nwhere Ph$_\\theta = e^{i\\theta} \\mathds{1}$ applies an overall phase $\\theta$ to a single qubit. For completeness we mention another universal gate set which is of particular interest from a theoretical perspective, namely\n$$\n\n\\mathcal G_1 = \\{\\H, \\S, \\T, \\CNOT{}\\},\n\n$$\n\nAs a technical aside, we mention that the restriction to a discrete gate set still gives rise to universality. This fact relies on using the so-called Solovay-Kitaev[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] theorem, which (roughly) states that any other single-qubit gate can be approximated to an error $\\epsilon$ using only $\\mathcal O(\\log^c (1/\\epsilon))$ (where $c>0$) single-qubit gates from $\\mathcal G_1$. The gate-set $\\mathcal{G}_1$ is typically referred to as the `Clifford + $T$' set, where $\\H$, $\\S$ and  are all Clifford gates.\n\nEach quantum computing architecture will have certain gates that are simpler to implement at the hardware level than others (sometimes referred to as 'native' gates of the architecture). These are typically the gates for which the Hamiltonian governing the gate-implementation gives rise to a unitary propagator that corresponds to the gate itself. We will show several examples of this in Sections <ref>, <ref>, and <ref>. Regardless of which gates are natively available, as long as one has a complete gate set, one can use the Solovay-Kitaev theorem to synthesize any other set efficiently. In general one wants to keep the overall number of time steps in which gates are applied (denoted the depth of a circuit) as low as possible, and one wants to use as many of the native gates as possible, to reduce the amount of time spent synthesising. Moreover, running a quantum algorithm also depends on the qubit connectivity of the device. The process of designing a quantum gate sequence that efficiently implements a specific algorithm, while taking into account the considerations outlined above is known as gate synthesis and gate compilation, respectively. A full discussion of this large research effort is outside the scope of this review, but the interested reader may consult e.g. Refs. Chong2017,Campbell2017,Alexandru2017 and references therein as a starting point. As a concrete (and trivial) example of how gate identities can be used, in <ref> we illustrate how the Hadamard gate from $\\mathcal G_1$ can be generated by two single-qubit gates (from $\\mathcal G_0$) and an overall phase gate,\n\n$$\n\n\\H &= \\text{Ph}_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\Y{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\Z{\\pi} = i\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & -1\\\\\n1 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-i & 0\\\\\n0 & i\n\\end{bmatrix}=\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1\\\\\n1 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\label{eq:Hfrompulses}\n\n$$\nAs we show in Sec. <ref>, the gates $\\X{\\theta}$, $\\Y{\\theta}$ and $\\Z{\\theta}$ are all natively available in a superconducting quantum processor.\n\nWe now address the question of how single qubit rotations and two-qubit operations are implemented in transmon-based superconducting quantum processors.\n\nAddressing superconducting qubits\n\nThe modes of addressing transmon-like superconducting qubits can roughly be split into two main categories: $i)$ Capacitive coupling between a resonator (or a feedline) and the superconducting qubit dipole-field allows for microwave control to implement single-qubit rotations (see Sec. <ref>) as well as certain two-qubit gates (see Sections <ref> and <ref>). $ii)$ For flux-tunable qubits, local magnetic fields can be used to tune the frequency of individual qubits. This allows the implementation of $z$-axis single-qubit rotation as well as multiple two-qubit gates (see Sections <ref>, <ref> and <ref>).\n\nSingle-qubit gates\n\nIn this section we will review the steps necessary to demonstrate that capacitive coupling of microwaves to a superconducting circuit can be used to drive single-qubit gates. To this end we consider coupling a superconducting qubit to a microwave source (sometimes referred to as a `qubit drive') as shown in <ref>(a).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nCircuit diagram of capacitive coupling of a microwave drive line (characterized by a time-dependent voltage $V_d(t)$) to a generic transmon-like superconducting qubit.\n\nA full circuit analysis of the circuit in <ref>(a) is beyond the scope of this review, so here we settle for highlighting the steps that elucidate the physics of the qubit/drive coupling. The interested reader may consult a number of lectures notes and pertinent theses (e.g. Refs. Devoret1997,Vool2017,SankPhD2014,Girvin2014,LangfordCQED). Here we follow Ref. SankPhD2014.\n\nCapacitive coupling for $\\X{}$,$\\Y{}$ control\n\nWe start by modeling the qubit as an harmonic oscillator, for which the (classical) circuit Hamiltonian can be calculated by circuit quantization techniques, starting from Kirchoffs laws, and is given by [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n$$\n\nH = \\frac{\\tilde Q(t)^2}{2C_\\Sigma}+\\frac{\\Phi^2}{2L}+\\frac{C_\\text{d}}{C_\\Sigma}V_\\text{d}(t)\\tilde Q,\n\n$$\nwhere $C_\\Sigma = C+C_\\text{d}$ is the total capacitance to ground and $\\tilde Q = C_\\Sigma \\dot \\Phi - C_\\text{d}V_\\text{d}(t)$ is a renormalized charge variable for the circuit. We can now promote the flux and charge variables to quantum operators and assume weak coupling to the drive-line, so that $\\tilde Q \\approx \\hat Q$, and arrive at\n$$\n\nH = H_\\text{LC} + \\frac{C_\\text{d}}{C_\\Sigma}V_\\text{d}(t) \\hat Q \\label{eq:quantumLCwithDrive},\n\n$$\nwhere $H_\\text{LC} = \\hat Q^2/(2C) + \\hat \\Phi^2/(2L)$ and we have kept only terms that couple to the dynamic variables. Similar to the momentum operator for a harmonic oscillator in $(x,p)$\u2013space, we can express the charge variable in terms of raising and lowering operators, as done in Sec. <ref>\n$$\n\n\\hat Q = -iQ_\\text{zpf}\\left(a-a^\\dagger \\right)\n\n$$\nwhere $Q_\\text{zpf} = \\sqrt{\\hbar/2Z}$ is the zero-point charge fluctations and $Z=\\sqrt{L/C}$ is the impedance of the circuit to ground. Thus, the $LC$ oscillator capacitively coupled to a drive line can be written as,\n$$\n\nH = \\omega \\left(a^\\dagger a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\frac{C_\\text{d}}{C_\\Sigma}V_d(t) iQ_\\text{zpf}\\left(a-a^\\dagger \\right). \\label{eq:DriveNlevels}\n\n$$\nFinally, by truncating to the lowest transition of the oscillator we can make the replacement $a \\rightarrow \\sigma^-$ and $a^\\dagger \\rightarrow \\sigma^+$ throughout and arrive at\n$$\n\nH = \\underbrace{-\\frac{\\freq}{2}\\sigma_z}_{H_0}+\\underbrace{\\vphantom{\\frac{1}{2}}\\Omega V_\\text{d}(t)\\sigma_y}_{H_\\d} \\label{eq:DriveHamLabFrame}\n\n$$\nwhere $ \\Omega = (C_\\text{d}/C_\\Sigma)Q_\\text{zpf}$ and $\\freq = (E_1 - E_0)/\\hbar$.[Starting from a generic qubit Hamiltonian, $H_0 = E_0 |0\\rangle\\langle 0| + E_1|1\\rangle\\langle 1|$, we can rewrite in terms of Pauli matrices, and get $H_0 = ((E_0+E_1)/2) \\mathds{1} - ((E_1-E_0)/2) \\sigma_z$. In the main text we have ignored the constant offset term.]\n\nTo elucidate the role of the drive, we move into a frame rotating with the qubit at frequency $\\freq$ (also denoted `the rotating frame' or the `the interaction frame'). To see the usefulness of this rotating frame, consider a state $|\\psi_0\\rangle = ( 1 \\quad 1)^T/\\sqrt{2}$. By the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation this state evolves according to\n$$\n\n|\\psi_0(t)\\rangle = U_{H_0}|\\psi_0\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} e^{i\\freq t/2} \\\\ e^{-i\\freq t/2} \\end{pmatrix},\n\n$$\nwhere $U_{H_0}$ is the propagator corresponding to $H_0$. By calculating e.g. $\\langle \\psi_0| \\sigma_x|\\psi_0\\rangle = \\cos(\\freq t)$ it is evident that the phase is winding with a frequency of $\\freq$ due to the $\\sigma_z$ term. By going into a frame rotating with the qubit at frequency $\\freq$, the action of the drive can be more clearly appreciated. To this end we define $U_\\rf = e^{iH_0 t} = U_{H_0}^\\dagger$ and the new state in the rotating frame is $|\\psi_\\rf(t)\\rangle = U_\\rf|\\psi_0\\rangle$. The time-evolution in this new frame is again found from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (using the shorthand $\\partial_t = \\partial / \\partial t$),\n$$\n\ni \\partial_t |\\psi_\\rf(t)\\rangle &= i(\\partial_tU_\\rf)|\\psi_0\\rangle + i U_\\rf\\left(\\partial_t|\\psi_0\\rangle\\right)\\\\\n&= i\\dot U_\\rf U_\\rf^\\dagger|\\psi_\\rf\\rangle + U_\\rf H_0 |\\psi_0\\rangle \\\\\n&= \\underbrace{\\left(i\\dot U_\\rf U_\\rf^\\dagger  + U_\\rf H_0 U^\\dagger_\\rf\\right)}_{\\widetilde H_0}|\\psi_\\rf\\rangle \\label{eq:RotFrameSchrodinger}\n\n$$\nWe can think of the term $\\widetilde H_0$ in the parentheses in <ref> as the form of $H_0$ in the rotating frame. Simple insertion shows that $\\widetilde H_0 = 0$ as expected (the rotating frame should take care of the time-dependence). However, one could also think of the term in brackets in <ref> as a prescription for calculating the form of any Hamiltonian in the rotating frame given by $U_\\rf$, by replacing $H_0$ with some other $H$. In general, we will not find $\\widetilde H = 0$.\n\nReturning to <ref>, the form of $H_\\text{d}$ in the rotating frame is found to be\n$$\n\n\\widetilde H_\\text{d} = \\Omega V_\\text{d}(t)\\left(\\cos(\\omega_\\text{q} t)\\sigma_y - \\sin(\\omega_\\text{q} t)\\sigma_x\\right).\n\\label{eq:RotatingFrame_drive}\n\n$$\nWe can in general assume that the time-dependent part of the voltage ($V_\\d(t) = V_0v(t)$) has the generic form\n$$\n\nv(t) & = s(t) \\sin(\\omega_\\d t + \\phi) \\\\\n& = s(t)\\left(\\cos(\\phi)\\sin(\\omega_\\d t) + \\sin(\\phi)\\cos(\\omega_\\d t) \\right), \\label{eq:IQdef}\n\n$$\nwhere $s(t)$ is a dimensionless envelope function, so that the amplitude of the drive is set by $V_0s(t)$. Adopting the definitions\n$$\n\nI &= \\cos(\\phi) \\text{ (the `in-phase' component)}\\\\\nQ &= \\sin(\\phi) \\text{ (the `out-of-phase' component)}\n\n$$\nthe driving Hamiltonian in the rotating frame takes the form\n$$\n\n\\widetilde H_\\text{d} &= \\Omega V_0 s(t)\\left( I \\sin(\\omega_\\d t) - Q \\cos(\\omega_\\d t)\\right)\\quad \\nonumber\\\\\n& \\hphantom{=} \\times \\left(\\cos(\\freq t)\\sigma_y - \\sin(\\freq t)\\sigma_x\\right)\n\n$$\nPerforming the multiplication and dropping fast rotating terms that will average to zero (i.e. terms with $\\freq + \\omega_d$), known as the rotating wave approximation (RWA), we are left with\n$$\n\n\\widetilde H_\\text{d}  & = \\frac{1}{2} \\Omega V_0 s(t) \\left[\\vphantom{\\frac{2}{2}} \\left(-I\\cos(\\omegad t) + Q\\sin(\\omegad t)\\right)\\sigma_x \\right. \\nonumber \\\\\n& \\hphantom{=} + \\left. \\left(I\\sin(\\omegad t) - Q\\cos(\\omegad t)\\right)\\sigma_y \\vphantom{\\frac{2}{2}}\\right]\n\n$$\nwhere $\\omegad = \\freq - \\omega_\\d$. Finally, by re-using the definitions from <ref>, the driving Hamiltonian in the rotating frame using the RWA can be written as\n$$\n\n\\widetilde H_\\text{d} = -\\frac{\\Omega}{2}V_0s(t) \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & e^{i(\\omegad t + \\phi)}\\\\\ne^{-i(\\omegad t + \\phi)} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} .\\label{eq:finalDriveHam}\n\n$$\nEquation (<ref>) is a powerful tool for understanding single-qubit gates in superconducting qubits. As a concrete example, assume that we apply a pulse at the qubit frequency, so that $\\omegad = 0$, then\n$$\n\n\\widetilde H_\\text{d} = -\\frac{\\Omega}{2}V_0s(t)\\left(I\\sigma_x +Q\\sigma_y \\right),\n\n$$\nshowing that an in-phase pulse ($\\phi =0$, i.e. the $I$-component) corresponds to rotations around the $x$-axis, while an out-of-phase pulse ($\\phi=\\pi/2$, i.e. the $Q$-component), corresponds to rotations about the $y$-axis. As a concrete example of an in-phase pulse, writing out the unitary operator yields\n$$\n\nU^{\\phi = 0}_\\text{rf,d}(t) = \\exp\\left( \\left[\\frac{i}{2}\\Omega  V_0 \\int_0^{t} s(t')\\d t'  \\right]\\sigma_x \\right), \\label{eq:drivingPropagator}\n\n$$\nwhich depends only on the macroscopic design parameters of the circuit as well as the envelope of the baseband pulse $s(t)$ and amplitude $V_0$, which can both be controlled using arbitrary waveform generators (AWGs). Equation (<ref>) is known as Rabi driving and can serve as a useful tool for engineering the circuit parameters needed for efficient gate operation (subject to the available output voltage $V_0$). To see this we define the shorthand\n$$\n\n\\Theta(t) = -\\Omega V_0\\int_0^{t} s(t')\\d t'\n\n$$\nwhich is the angle by which a state is rotated given the capacitive couplings, the impedance of the circuit, the magnitude $V_0$, and the waveform envelope, $s(t)$. This means that to implement a $\\pi$-pulse on the $x$-axis one would solve the equation $\\Theta(t) = \\pi$ and output the signal in-phase with the qubit drive. In this language, a sequence of pulses (see <ref>(a)) $\\Theta_k, \\Theta_{k-1},...\\Theta_0$ is converted to a sequence of gates operating on a qubit as\n$$\n\n% U_k\\cdots U_1U_0 = e^{\\left[-\\frac{i}{2} \\Theta_n(t)\\left(I_n \\sigma_x + Q_n \\sigma_y\\right)\\right]} \\times \\cdots\\\\  e^{\\left[-\\frac{i}{2} \\Theta_n(t)\\left(I_n \\sigma_x + Q_n \\sigma_y\\right)\\right]}\nU_k\\cdots U_1U_0 = \\mathcal T\\prod_{n=0}^k  e^{\\left[-\\frac{i}{2} \\Theta_n(t)\\left(I_n \\sigma_x + Q_n \\sigma_y\\right)\\right]}, \\label{eq:sequencesandwaveforms}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal T$ is an operator that ensures the pulses are generated in the time-ordered sequence corresponding to $U_k\\cdots U_1U_0$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Schematic of a typical qubit drive setup. A microwave source supplies a high-frequency signal ($\\omega_\\textsf{LO}$), while an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) supplies a pulse-envelope ($s(t)$), sometimes with a low frequency component, $\\omega_\\textsf{AWG}$, generated by the AWG. The IQ-mixer combines the two signals to generate a shaped waveform $V_d(t)$ with a frequency $\\omega_d = \\omega_\\textsf{LO} \\pm \\omega_\\textsf{AWG}$, typically resonant with the qubit.

(c) The action of a $\\X{\\pi/2}$ pulse on a $|0\\rangle$ state to produce the $|\\!-\\!i\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(|0\\rangle -i |1\\rangle \\right)$ state.\n\nIn <ref> we outline the typical IQ modulation setup used to generate the pulses used in <ref>. <ref>(a) shows how a pulse at frequency $\\omega_\\text{d}$ is generated using a low phase-noise microwave generator (typically denoted `the local oscillator (LO)'), while the pulse is shaped by combining the LO signal in an IQ mixer with pulses generated in an AWG. To allow for frequency multiplexing, the AWG signal will typically be generated with a low-frequency component, $\\omega_\\text{AWG}$, and the LO signal will be offset, so that $\\omega_\\text{LO} + \\omega_\\text{AWG} = \\omega_\\text{d}$. By mixing in more than one frequency $\\omega_\\text{AWG1}, \\omega_\\text{AWG2}, ...$ it is possible to address multiple qubits (or readout resonators) simultaneously, via the superposition of individual drives.\n\nThe $I$ ($Q$) input of the $IQ$ mixer will multiply the baseband signal to the in-phase (out-of-phase) component of the LO. In <ref>(b) we schematically show the comparison between $XY$ gates in a quantum circuit and the corresponding waveforms generated in the AWG (omitting for clarity the frequency $\\omega_\\text{AWG}$ component). The inset in <ref>(b) shows an example of a gate on the Bloch sphere, with indication of $(I,Q)$ axes. More sophisticated and compact approaches exist to reduce the hardware needed for $XY$ qubit control, relative to the setup shown in <ref>, see e.g. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nVirtual $\\Z{}$ gate\n\nAs we saw in Sec. <ref>, the distinction between $x$\u2013 and $y$\u2013rotations was merely a choice of phase on the microwave signals, and the angle to be rotated is given by $\\Theta(t)$, both of which are generated using an AWG. Since the choice of phase $\\phi$ has an arbitrary starting point, we could consider $\\phi \\rightarrow \\phi+\\pi/2$. This would lead to $I \\rightarrow Q$ and $Q \\rightarrow -I$. Therefore, changing the phase effectively changes rotations around $x$ to rotations around $y$ (and vice-versa, with a change of sign). This is reminiscent of the result of applying a $\\Z{\\pi}$ rotation to $x$\u2013 and $y$\u2013rotations, where $\\Z{\\pi} \\X{\\pi} = i\\Y{\\pi}$ and $\\Z{\\pi} \\Y{\\pi} = - i\\X{\\pi}$. This analogy between shifting a phase of an AWG-generated signal and applying $\\Z{}$ rotations can be utilized to implement virtual $\\Z{}$ gates[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. As shown by McKay et al., this intuition can be formalized via the following example: consider the case of applying a pulse with an angle $\\theta$ on the $I$ channel (i.e. a $\\X{\\theta}$) followed by another $\\theta$ pulse on the $I$ channel, but with a phase $\\phi_0$ relative to the first pulse (denoted $\\X{\\theta}^{(\\phi_0)}$, where $\\X{}$ indicates we still use the $I$ channel, but the rotation axis is now an angle $\\phi_0$ away from the $x$-axis). Using <ref> this corresponds to a pulse sequence\n$$\n\n\\X{\\theta}^{(\\phi_0)}\\X{\\theta} &= e^{-i\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\left(\\cos(\\phi_0)\\sigma_x + \\sin(\\phi_0) \\sigma_y\\right)}\\X{\\theta}\\\\\n& = \\Z{-\\phi_0}\\X{\\theta}\\Z{\\phi_0}\\X{\\theta}\n\n$$\nfrom which we see that the effect of the offset phase $\\phi_0$ is to apply $\\Z{\\phi_0}$. The equality above can be verified with a little trigonometric footwork. The final $\\Z{-\\phi_0}$ is due to the rotation being in the frame of reference of the qubit. However, since readout is along $z$-axis (see Sec. <ref>), a final phase rotation about $z$ will not change the measurement outcome. Thus, if one wants to to implement the gate sequence\n$$\n\n\\Qcircuit @C=0.5em @R=0.75em{\n\\cdots & & & \\gate{U_i} & \\gate{\\Z{\\theta_0}} & \\gate{U_{i+1}} & \\gate{\\Z{\\theta_1}} & \\gate{U_{i+2}}  & \\qw & & \\cdots}\n\n$$\nwhere $U_i$'s are arbitrary gates, this can be done by revising the gate sequence (in the control software for the AWG) and changing the phase of subsequent pulses\n$$\n\n\\Qcircuit @C=0.5em @R=0.75em{\n\\cdots & & &  \\gate{U_i \\vphantom{U^{(\\theta_0)}_{i+1}}}  & \\gate{U^{(\\theta_0)}_{i+1}} & \\gate{U^{(\\theta_0+\\theta_1)}_{i+2}}  & \\qw & & \\cdots}\n\n$$\nwhich reduces the number of overall gates. Moreover, the virtual-$\\Z{}$ gates are \u201cperfect\", in the sense that no additional pulses are required, and the gate takes \u201czero time\", and thus the gate fidelity is nominally unity. As we show in Sections <ref> and <ref>, operation of two-qubit gates can incur additional single-qubit phases. Using the virtual-$\\Z{}$ strategy, these phases can be cancelled out, leaving a pure two-qubit interaction.\n\nFinally we mention one more salient feature of the virtual-$\\Z{}$ gates. As shown in Ref.McKay2016, any single-qubit operation (up to a global phase) can be written as\n$$\n\nU(\\theta,\\phi,\\lambda) = \\Z{\\phi-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\X{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\Z{\\pi-\\theta} \\X{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\Z{\\lambda-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}, \\label{eq:anySU2}\n\n$$\nfor appropriate choice of angles $\\theta, \\phi, \\lambda$. This means that access to a single physical $\\X{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ combined with the virtual-$\\Z{}$ gives access to a complete single qubit gate set! An explicit example of <ref> in action is the Hadamard gate, which can be written as $\\H = \\Z{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\X{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\Z{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$, but since the $\\Z{}$'s can be virtual, it is possible to implement Hadamards as an effective single pulse operation in superconducting qubits.\n\nThe DRAG scheme\n\nIn going from <ref> to <ref> we assumed we could ignore the higher levels of the qubit. However, for weakly anharmonic qubits, such as the transmon (see Sec. <ref>), this may not be a justified assumption, since $\\omega^{1\\rightarrow 2}_\\text{q}$ only differs from $\\omega_\\text{q} (\\equiv \\omega_\\text{q}^{0\\rightarrow 1})$ by the anharmonicity, $\\alpha = \\omega^{1\\rightarrow 2}_\\text{q} - \\omega_\\text{q}$, which is negative and typically around $200$ to $300$\u00a0MHz. This situation is sketched in <ref>(a-c), where we illustrate how Gaussian pulses with standard deviations $\\sigma = \\{1,2,5\\}$\u00a0ns have spectral content that leads to non-zero overlaps with the $\\omega^{1\\rightarrow2}_\\text{q} = \\omega_\\text{q}-|\\alpha|$ frequency.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Schematic level diagram of a weakly anharmonic transmon qubit subjected to a drive at transition frequency $\\omega_\\d = \\freq$. (b) Gaussian waveform with standard deviation $\\sigma$. (c) Fourier transform of (b) showing how the short pulse lengths lead to significant overlap with the $\\omega_\\text{q}^{1\\rightarrow2}$ transition, separated from $\\omega_\\text{q}$ by the anharmonicity $\\alpha$. (d) Waveform of a $\\X{\\pi}$ pulse without DRAG modulation. (e) Effect of the waveform from (d) on a qubit initialized in the $|0\\rangle$ state with $\\alpha = -200$\u00a0MHz and $\\omega_\\text{q} = 4$\u00a0GHz. The dephasing error is visible as a deviation from the $|1\\rangle$ after the pulse. (f) Waveform of a $\\X{\\pi}$ pulse with DRAG modulation for a qubit with anharmonicity $\\alpha = -200$\u00a0MHz and DRAG parameter $\\lambda = 0.5$ to cancel dephasing errors (see text for details). (g) Effect of the waveform from (f) on the same qubit as (e). Calculated using  in the software package [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThis leads to two deleterious effects: (1) leakage errors which take the qubit out of the computational subspace, and (2) phase errors. Effect 1 can occur because a qubit in the state $|1\\rangle$ may be excited to $|2\\rangle$ as a $\\pi$ pulse is applied, or be excited directly from the $|0\\rangle$, since the qubit spends some amount of time in the $|1\\rangle$ state during the $\\pi$ pulse. Effect 2 occurs because the presence of the drive results in a repulsion between the $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$ levels, in turn changing $\\omega_\\text{q}^{0\\rightarrow 1}$ as the pulse is applied. This leads to the accumulation of a relative phase between $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The so-called DRAG procedure[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (Derivative Reduction by Adiabatic Gate) seeks to combat these two effects by applying an extra signal in the out-of-phase component. The trick is to modify the waveform envelope $s(t)$ according to\n$$\n\n\\renewcommand*{\\arraystretch}{1.3}\ns(t)\\rightarrow s'(t) =\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ccl}\ns(t) & \\text{ on } & I\\\\\n\\displaystyle \\lambda\\frac{\\dot s(t)}{\\alpha} & \\text{ on } & Q\\\\\n\\end{array}\\right., \\label{eq:DRAG_waveform}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a dimensionless scaling parameter, and $\\lambda = 0$ correspond to no DRAG pulse and $\\dot{s}(t)$ is the time derivative of $s(t)$. The theoretically optimal choice for reducing dephasing error is $\\lambda = 0.5$ and an optimal choice for reducing leakage error is $\\lambda = 1$[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Interchanging $I$ and $Q$ in <ref> corresponds to DRAG pulsing for the $Q$ component.\n\nIn practice there can be a deviation from these two optimal values, often due to pulse distortions in the lines leading to the qubits. Typically, randomized benchmarking experiments combined with single-shot measurements (see Sec. <ref>) of the $|2\\rangle$ state is used to determine the optimal value of $\\lambda$. The $\\lambda=\\{0.5,1\\}$ tradeoff was demonstrated explicitly in [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, by extending the original DRAG pulse implementation[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], it is is possible to reduce both errors simultaneously. By introducing a frequency detuning parameter $\\delta f$ to the waveform[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (defined such that $\\delta f = 0$ corresponds to qubit frequency), i.e.\n$$\n\ns'_{\\delta f}(t) = s'(t)e^{i2\\pi\\delta f t},\n\n$$\nand choosing $\\lambda$ to minimize leakage errors, then phase errors can be reduced simultaneously[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Similarly, by a judicious use of the virtual-$\\Z{}$ gate, it is also possible to reduce phase errors in combination with DRAG pulsing to reduce leakage [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Modern single-qubit gates using DRAG pulsing now routinely reach fidelities $F_\\text{1qb} \\gtrsim 0.99$ [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Other techniques also exist for operating single-qubit gates in a spectrally crowded device [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe $i$ two-qubit gate in tunable qubits\n\nAs briefly mentioned in Sec. <ref>, single-qubit gates supplemented with an entangling two-qubit gate can form the gate set required for universal quantum computation. The two-qubit gates available in the transmon-like superconducting qubit architecture can roughly be split into two broad families as outlined previously: one group requiring local magnetic fields to tune the transition frequency of qubits and one group consisting of all-microwave control. There exist several hybrid schemes that combine various aspects of these two categories and, in particular, the notions of tunable coupling and parametric driving are proving to be important ingredients in modern superconducting qubit processors[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In this section, however, we start by introducing the  gate, and then review the  (controlled-phase) in Section <ref> and the  (cross-resonance) in Section <ref>. We briefly review a few other two-qubit gates and discuss their merits in Sections <ref> and <ref>.\n\nDeriving the $i$ unitary\n\nAs we saw in Sec. <ref>, Eq.<ref> the interaction term between two capacitively coupled qubits (in the two-level approximation) is given by\n$$\n\nH_\\text{qq} = g \\sigma_{y1} \\otimes \\sigma_{y2}, \\label{eq:Hqqsigmay}\n\n$$\nwhere $g$ is the coupling strength and $\\otimes$ is used to emphasize  the tensor product. If the capacitive coupling is mediated through a bus resonator, then [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n$$\n\ng\\rightarrow g_\\text{q-r-q} = \\frac{g_1g_2(\\Delta_1+\\Delta_2)}{2\\Delta_1\\Delta_2}, \\label{eq:gqrq}\n\n$$\nwhere $g_i$ is the resonator coupling to qubit $i$ (dependent on the qubit-resonator coupling capacitance $C_{\\text{q}i\\text{r}}$) and $\\Delta_i = \\omega_{\\text{q}i} - \\omega_\\text{r}$ is the detuning of qubit $i$ to the resonator. In the simpler case where the qubits are directly coupled[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ],\n$$\n\ng\\rightarrow g_\\text{q-q} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\omega_{\\text{q}1}\\omega_{\\text{q}2}}\\frac{C_\\text{q-q}}{\\sqrt{C_\\text{q-q}+C_1}\\sqrt{C_\\text{q-q}+C_2}}, \\label{eq:gqq}\n\n$$\nwhere $C_\\text{q-q}$ is the qubit-qubit coupling capacitance and $C_i$ is the capacitance of qubit $i$. Throughout this section, we will assume a direct capacitive coupling between qubits of the flux-tunable transmon type, so that $g = g_\\text{q-q}$ and $\\omega_{\\text{q}i} \\rightarrow \\omega_{\\text{q}i}(\\Phi_i)$. For simplicity, we suppress the explicit flux dependence of the $\\omega_{\\text{q}i}$'s and simply refer to the coupling as $g$. Equation (<ref>) can be rewritten as\n$$\n\nH_\\text{qq} = -g\\left([\\sigma^+ - \\sigma^-]\\otimes[\\sigma^+ - \\sigma^-]\\right),\n\n$$\nand then using the rotating wave approximation again (i.e. dropping fast rotating terms) we arrive at\n$$\n\nH_\\text{qq} = g\\left(e^{i\\delta\\omega_{12}t}\\sigma^+\\sigma^- + e^{-i\\delta\\omega_{12}t}\\sigma^-\\sigma^+\\right),\n\n$$\nwhere we have introduced the notation $\\delta \\omega_{12} = \\omega_{\\text{q}1} - \\omega_{\\text{q}2}$ and suppressed the explicit tensor product between qubit subspaces. If we now change the flux of qubit 1 to bring it into resonance with qubit 2 ($\\omega_{\\text{q}1} = \\omega_{\\text{q}2}$), then\n$$\n\nH_\\text{qq} = g\\left( \\sigma^+\\sigma^- + \\sigma^-\\sigma^+\\right) = \\frac{g}{2}\\left(\\sigma_x\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y\\sigma_y \\right). \\label{eq:Hxxyy}\n\n$$\nThe first part of <ref> shows that a capacitive interaction leads to a swapping of excitations between the two qubits, giving rise to the `swap' in . Moreover, due to the last part of <ref>, this capacitive coupling is also sometimes said to give rise to an `$XY$' interaction[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The unitary corresponding to a $XY$ (swap) interaction is\n$$\n\nU_{qq}(t) = e^{-i\\frac{g}{2}\\left(\\sigma_x\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y\\sigma_y \\right)t}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\cos(gt) & -i\\sin(gt) & 0\\\\\n0 & -i\\sin(gt) & \\cos(gt) & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\label{eq:Uqq}\n\n$$\nSince the qubits are tunable in frequency, we can now consider the effect of tuning the qubits into resonance for a time $t' = \\frac{\\pi}{2g}$,\n$$\n\nU_{qq}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2g}\\right) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -i & 0\\\\\n0 & -i & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\equiv i\\textsf{SWAP}.\n\n$$\nFrom this result, we see that a capacitive coupling between qubits turned on for a time $t'$ (inversely related to the coupling strength in units of radial frequency) leads to implementing a so called `$i\\textsf{SWAP}$' gate[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which acts to swap an excitation between the two qubits, and add a phase of $i = e^{i\\pi/2}$. For completeness, we note that for $t'' = \\frac{\\pi}{4g}$ the resulting unitary,\n$$\n\nU_{qq}\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4g}\\right) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\sfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & -\\sfrac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\\\\\n0 & -\\sfrac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\sfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\equiv \\sqrt{i\\textsf{SWAP}},\n\n$$\nis typically referred to as the `squareroot-$i\\textsf{SWAP}$' gate. The $\\sqrt{\\iSWAP{}}$ gate can be used to generate Bell-like superposition states, e.g. $|01\\rangle + i |10\\rangle$.\n\nTo elucidate the operating principle behind an $\\iSWAP{}$ implementation we show the spectrum of a flux-tunable qubit using typical transmon-like parameters in <ref>(a). The  is performed at the avoided crossing where $\\Phi = \\Phi_{\\iSWAP{}}$. By preparing QB1 in state $|1\\rangle$, moving into the avoided crossing, waiting there for a time $\\tau$ (see pulse-sequence in inset in <ref>(b)), the excitation is swapped back and forth between the two qubits, as shown in <ref>(b). In <ref>(c), we plot linecuts of (b) at $\\Phi_{\\iSWAP{}}$, showing the excitation oscillating back and forth between $|01\\rangle$ and $|10\\rangle$ with the predicted time $t' = \\pi/2g$. In turn, the frequency of the oscillation can be used to extract the strength of the coupling, $\\frac{2}{t'} = \\frac{g}{\\pi}$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Spectrum of two transmon qubits (written in the combined basis as $|\\text{QB1},\\text{QB2}\\rangle$) as the local flux through the loop of qubit 1 is increased. Black/dashed lines with arrows indicate a typical flux trajectory to demonstrate operation of  gate. (b) Probability of swapping into the $|01\\rangle$ state as a function of time and flux. The pulse sequence corresponds to preparing $|10\\rangle$ and performing a typical  operation (for a time $\\tau$). (c) Probabilities of $|01\\rangle$ (black) and $|10\\rangle$ (gray) at $\\Phi = \\Phi_{\\iSWAP{}}$ (white dashed line in (b)) as the time spent at the operating point ($\\tau$) is increased. This simulation does not include any decay effects.\n\nSo far we have ignored the role of the single-qubit phases acquired by tuning the qubit frequency. Referring to the pulse-sequence shown in the top panel of \u00a0<ref>(a), we see that each qubit will acquire a phase given by\n$$\n\n\\theta_z = \\int_0^\\tau \\d t \\left( \\omega_\\text{q} - \\omega(t)\\right).\n\n$$\nThis phase can be conveniently removed either by subsequent application of virtual-$\\Z{}$ gates to all following pulses[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], or by shaping the waveform of the excursion such that single-qubit phases are exactly cancelled [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nEquations (<ref>) and (<ref>) together present a useful result from a quantum processor design perspective: The operating regime, frequency and time $\\tau$ of the  can be calculated (typically simulated) to high precision, before any processor fabrication is undertaken. The only `quantum' parts that enter $g_\\text{qq}$ (and $g_\\text{q-r-q}$) are the qubit frequencies, $\\omega_{\\text{q}1}(\\Phi_1)$ and $\\omega_{\\text{q}2}(\\Phi_2)$. If the Josephson energies of the qubits are known (which they typically are, from fabrication parameters), then by simulating the capacitances in $g_\\text{qq}$ or $g_\\text{q-r-q}$, the time $\\tau$ and the pulseshape needed to implement an  can be estimated to high precision. Typical values of the coupling strength, $g/(2\\pi)$, for architectures using the  gate is 5-40 MHz and are often very close to expectations from EM simulations [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nApplications of the $i$ gate\n\nThe $i\\textsf{SWAP}$ cannot generate a  gate by itself. Rather, to implement a  gate requires stringing together two $i\\textsf{SWAP}$s and several single qubit gates[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ],\n$$\n\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n\\Qcircuit @C=0.5em @R=2.2em{\n& \\ctrl{1} &  \\qw \\\\\n& \\targ & \\qw \\\n} & \\raisebox{-1.5em}{=} &\n\\Qcircuit @C=0.5em @R=1.1em{\n& \\qw         &  \\gate{\\Z{\\text{-}\\frac{\\pi}{2}}}     & \\multigate{1}{\\iSWAP{}} & \\gate{\\X{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}}& \\multigate{1}{\\iSWAP{}} & \\qw & \\qw & \\qw\\\\\n& \\gate{\\X{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}} & \\gate{\\Z{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}} & \\ghost{\\iSWAP{}} & \\qw & \\ghost{\\iSWAP{}} & \\qw & \\gate{\\Z{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}} & \\qw \\\\\n}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{eq:CNOT_swap}\n\n$$\nAs evident from <ref>, the  gate in general needs to be used twice to generate a single , leading to a significant overhead when compiling \u2013dense circuits from  gates. However, depending on the context, the  can be used efficiently (i.e. without any two-qubit gate overhead) to mimic the behavior of a . Typically such circuits will not be completely equivalent, but will share certain salient features for specified input states. As an example of this procedure, Neeley [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] demonstrated the generation of a 3-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state (which requires two subsequent s in the simplest construction), by using only two s in a circuit that correctly generates the 3-qubit GHZ state on the $|000\\rangle$ input. Moreover, the $XY$\u2013interaction is a powerful tool for certain types of quantum simulation algorithms[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. If one is interested in digital quantum simulation of spin\u2013like systems, then the $XY$\u2013interaction can natively simulate e.g. a Heisenberg interaction,\n$$\n\nH_\\text{Heisenberg} = J_x\\sigma_x\\sigma_x + J_y\\sigma_y\\sigma_y+J_z\\sigma_z\\sigma_z.\n\n$$\nThis approach to the $XY$ interaction was demonstrated by Salath\u00e9 [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where repeated application of the  gate interspersed with single-qubit rotations was used to generate successive $XY$, $XZ$ and $YZ$ interactions that lead to an aggregate $H_\\text{Heisenberg}$ Hamiltonian.  State-of-the-art operation of the  gate has also been used to demonstrate a ten-qubit GHZ state[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe  two-qubit gate in tunable qubits\n\nIn our discussion of the  gates, we assumed that the higher energy levels of the superconducting qubit do not play a role. As we show below, it turns out that for the case of transmon qubits (with negative anharmonicity), the higher levels can in fact be utilized to generate a the  gate directly[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nRecall from Sec.\u00a0<ref> that the  gate implements the following unitary,\n$$\n\nU_\\CPHASE{} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n$$\nOur goal for the remainder of this section is to show that the unitary operator of the  gate appears naturally for capacitively coupled transmon superconducting qubits and review a few of the modern applications of this gate. We have chosen to include a considerable amount of details for the implementation of this gate, as a means to review some of the issues one has to resolve, to engineer high quality two-qubit gates.\n\nThe structure of the matrix in <ref> indicates that we need to apply a phase ($-1 = e^{i\\pi}$) to the qubits whenever both are in the excited state $|11\\rangle$. Considering the nature of the $XY$ interaction, which couples $|01\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |10\\rangle$ and leads to the  gate (see previous section), we expect avoided level crossings to exist between higher levels, e.g. $|11\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |20\\rangle$ and $|11\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |02\\rangle$. The flux-tunable implementation of the  gate relies on this higher-level avoided crossing.\n\nTo motivate this intuition we plot the spectrum for two coupled transmon qubits, in <ref>(a), including levels with two excitations, as the local magnetic flux in qubit 1 is being tuned. The Hamiltonian for this spectrum, written in the  $\\{|00\\rangle, |01\\rangle, |10\\rangle, |11\\rangle, |02\\rangle, |20\\rangle \\}$-basis, is approximately given by,\n$$\n\nH_\\text{2 excitations} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nE_{00} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & E_{01} & g & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & g & E_{10} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & E_{11} & \\sqrt{2}g & \\sqrt{2}g \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & \\sqrt{2}g & E_{02} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & \\sqrt{2}g & 0 & E_{20} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\label{eq:6lvlHam}\n\n$$\nwhere $E_{nm} = E^\\text{q1}_n(\\Phi_1) + E^\\text{q2}_m(\\Phi_2)$ and $E_n(\\Phi_i)$ is the flux-dependent energy of the $i$-th level of a transmon [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and the $\\{|02\\rangle,|20\\rangle\\} \\leftrightarrow |11\\rangle$ transitions are scaled by a factor $\\sqrt{2}$ due to the higher photon number. In <ref>, we plot the frequencies $\\omega_{nm} = E_{nm} - E_{00}$ calculated from <ref>, using standard, symmetric, transmon-like parameters, as the local magnetic field of qubit 1 is increased.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Spectrum of two coupled transmon qubits (using typical transmon-like values for Josephson energies and capacitances) as the local magnetic flux for qubit 1 is varied. The two lower branches corresponding to $|01\\rangle$ and $|10\\rangle$ are involved in the  gate operation at $\\Phi = \\Phi_\\text{iSWAP}$. The avoided crossing indicated in the black rectangle is used to implement the conditional phase gate (), at $\\Phi = \\Phi_\\text{\\CPHASE{}}$. Black line with arrows indicate a typical trajectory used to implement a  gate (starting at the black circle and ending at the gray circle). (b) Zoom in of the $|20\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |11\\rangle$ avoided crossing highlighted in the black box in (a) at $\\Phi = \\Phi_{\\CPHASE{}}$. The parameter $\\zeta$ quantifies the difference in energy between $|11\\rangle$ and $|01\\rangle + |10\\rangle$ and $\\ell(\\tau)$ is the trajectory in ($\\Phi,t$)\u2013space.\n\nThe result of the higher levels on the computational basis can be understood by considering a concrete example. By preparing the combined qubit state $|11\\rangle$ and moving slowly towards the avoided crossing between $|11\\rangle$ and $|20\\rangle$ at $\\Phi_{\\CPHASE{}}$, waiting for some time $\\tau$ and moving back (see black line with arrows in <ref>(b)), the resulting unitary operator in the computational basis is given by\n$$\n\nU_\\text{ad} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & e^{i\\theta_{01}(\\ell)} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & e^{i\\theta_{10}(\\ell)} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & e^{i\\theta_{11}(\\ell)} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix},\\label{eq:Uadiabatic}\n\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\n\\theta_{ij}(\\ell(\\tau)) = \\int_0^{\\tau} \\d t\\, \\omega_{ij}[\\ell(t)]\n\n$$\nis the phase acquired by the state $|ij\\rangle$ along the trajectory $\\ell$ in ($\\Phi$, $t$)-space during time $\\tau$. The movement should be sufficiently slow on a time-scale set by $g$ that the moving state never populates the $|20\\rangle$ state, i.e. the movement should be adiabatic. In terms of applied flux, the avoided crossing between the $|11\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |20\\rangle$ state happens before $|10\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |01\\rangle$ (due to the negative anharmonicity of the transmons, $\\alpha \\approx -E_c$) and consequently $\\ell$ does not take the states through the $\\Phi_{\\iSWAP{}}$ operating point. As shown in <ref>(b) we can define a parameter (typically denoted $\\zeta$) quantifying the difference in phase acquired by the $|11\\rangle$ relative to the single excitation states,\n$$\n\n\\zeta = \\left(\\omega_{11} - (\\omega_{01}+\\omega_{10})\\right).\n\n$$\nThe parameter $\\zeta$ can be thought of as the result (in the computational space) of the repulsion of $|11\\rangle$ due to the $|20\\rangle$ state. If we now choose a trajectory $\\ell_\\pi$, designed so that $\\int_0^{\\tau}  \\zeta(\\ell_\\pi(t)) dt = \\pi$, then\n$$\n\n\\int_0^{\\tau}  \\zeta(t) dt= \\pi  = \\theta_{11}(\\ell_\\pi) - \\left(\\theta_{01}(\\ell_\\pi) + \\theta_{10}(\\ell_\\pi)\\right).\n\n$$\nInserting this expression into <ref> we see that\n$$\n\nU_\\text{ad} &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & e^{i\\theta_{01}(\\ell_\\pi)} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & e^{i\\theta_{10}(\\ell_\\pi)} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & e^{i(\\pi + \\theta_{01}(\\ell_\\pi) + \\theta_{10}(\\ell_\\pi))} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\label{eq:Uadfixedphase}\n\n$$\nAfter the adiabatic excursion, one can now apply single-qubit pulses (or use virtual- gates) to exactly cancel the single-qubit phases such that $\\theta_{10}(\\ell_\\pi) = \\theta_{01}(\\ell_\\pi) = 0$. This changes $U_\\text{ad}$ to\n$$\n\nU_\\text{ad} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & e^{i\\pi} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} =\nU_\\CPHASE{}. \\label{eq:howtogetCPHASE}\n\n$$\nFrom <ref> it is evident that an adiabatic movement of $|11\\rangle$, followed by single-qubit gates (virtual or real) efficiently implements a  and, through <ref>, also efficiently implements a . The  gate is one of the workhorses of modern superconducting qubit processesors with gate fidelities $\\gtrsim 0.99$ [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nOne is, of course, free to choose an arbitrary trajectory $\\ell_\\phi$ that implements the phase $e^{-i\\phi}$ on the $|11\\rangle$ state. Assuming that the single-qubit phases are properly cancelled, one sees that the arbitrary phase version of the  gate (typically denoted $\\textsf{CZ}_\\phi$) can be written as\n$$\n\n\\textsf{CZ}_\\phi &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & e^{-i\\phi} \\nonumber\n\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n& = \\exp\\left[-i\\frac{\\phi}{4}\\left(\\sigma_z\\otimes \\sigma_z-\\sigma_z\\otimes \\Id - \\Id \\otimes \\sigma_z\\right)\\right]. \\label{eq:CZtheta}\n\n$$\nBecause of the form of <ref>, one can think of the avoided crossing with the higher levels outside the computational subspace as giving rise to an effective $\\sigma_z\\otimes \\sigma_z$ coupling within the computational subspace [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nAn alternative to the adiabatic approach outlined above to realize  is to make a sudden excursion to the $\\Phi_{\\CPHASE{}}$ operating point, after waiting a time $t=\\pi/\\sqrt{2}g$, the state will have completed a single Larmor-type rotation from $|11\\rangle$ to $|02\\rangle$ and back again to $|11\\rangle$, but in the process, acquired an overall $\\pi$ phase, similar to the  gate, but in the $\\{|11\\rangle, |20\\rangle\\}$ subspace[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In fact, such excursions near or through avoided crossings leading to adiabatic and non-adiabatic transitions have been studied extensively in the context of interferometry, cooling, spectroscopy, and quantum control[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe remainder of this subsection is devoted to an overview of some of the recent advances and demonstrations using the  gate since its first demonstration in 2009 where it was used to generate Bell-states and demonstrate two-qubit algorithms [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nTrajectory design for the  gate\n\nThe (adiabatic) implemention of $U_\\CPHASE$ outlined above assumed that the trajectory $\\ell_\\pi$ was completely adiabiatic and that the $|11\\rangle$ state never left the computational subspace. Since the fidelity of gates is bounded from above by the coherence times of the qubits, short gate times are desirable[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This presents a tension for optimally operating the  gate \u2013 fast operation in conjunction with the need for adiabatic operation. A relevant question is then: what is the optimal trajectory $\\ell^\\star_\\pi$ that implements the necessary phase as fast as possible, with as little leakage as possible, for a given size of the avoided crossing between $|11\\rangle$ and $|20\\rangle$? Given a typical coupling rate $g/2\\pi \\approx 20$ MHz (as discussed in Sec. <ref>), one expects a heuristic lower time limit to be $2\\pi/g \\approx 50$ ns (stronger coupling of course leads to shorter gate times, but will limit the on/off ratio of the gate). Traditional optimal control of adiabatic movement assumes the movement is through the avoided crossing (see e.g. Ref. Bason2012), but the trajectory $\\ell_\\pi$ moves close to and then back from the avoided crossing. This modification to the adiabatic movement protocol was addressed by Martinis and Geller [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], specifically in the context of errors for a  gate implemention. The authors show that non-adiabatic errors can be minimal for gate times only slightly longer than $2\\pi/g$ using an optimal waveform (based on a Slepian waveform [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]) to parametrize the trajectory $\\ell_\\pi^\\star(\\tau)$.\n\nThe  gate for quantum error correction\n\nUsing the approach of Martinis and Geller, Barends  were able to demonstrate a two-qubit gate fidelity $\\mathcal F_\\CPHASE{} = 0.9944$ (determined via a technique known as `interleaved randomized benchmarking' [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]). This implementation had a gate time $\\tau = 43$ ns and was implemented with the $\\ell^\\star_\\pi$ waveform[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], in an \u201cxmon\" device [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] \u2013 a transmon with a \u201c+\"-shaped capacitor. A two-qubit gate fidelity $\\mathcal F >0.99$ represents a significant milestone, not just from a technical and engineering perspective, but also from a foundational standpoint: The surface code (a quantum error correcting code) has a lenient fault-tolerance threshold of $\\sim 1\\%$[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This means, roughly speaking, that if the underlying operations on the qubits have fidelities $\\mathcal F>0.99$, then by adding more qubits to the circuit (and correctly implementing the fault-tolerant quantum error correction protocol) the overall error-rate can be reduced, and one can in principle perform arbitrarily long quantum computations, without errors spreading uncontrollably and corrupting the calculation. Because of its relatively lenient threshold under circuit noise (compared to e.g., Steane or Shor codes [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]) and its use of solely nearest-neighbor coupling, the surface code is one of the most promising quantum error correction codes for medium-to-large scale quantum computing in solid state systems[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Therefore, surpassing the fault-tolerance threshold using  represents a significant milestone for the field[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Moreover, practical blueprints for implementing scalable subcells of the surface code using the  as the fundamental two-qubit gate have also been proposed [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] as well as in-situ calibration protocols for large-scale systems operating with [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For a full review of the pros and cons of various quantum error correcting codes we refer the interested reader to e.g. an introductory review article Ref. Devitt2013, or any of the excellent textbooks and more detailed review articles in Refs. NielsenChuang,Williams2008,Gottesman2009,Devitt2013,Lidar2013,Terhal2015,Campbell2017a.\n\nReturning to the  gate, numerical optimization of $\\ell^\\star_\\pi$ was demonstrated by Kelly [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] using the interleaved randomized benchmarking sequence fidelity as a cost function to push a native implementation of $\\ell^\\star_\\pi$ with a fidelity $\\mathcal F = 0.984$ up to $\\mathcal F = 0.993$, surpassing the surface code fault tolerance threshold. In the same work that demonstrated $\\mathcal F_\\CPHASE{} = 0.9944$, Barends [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] used the  gate to generate GHZ states, $|\\text{GHZ}\\rangle = \\left(|0\\rangle^{\\otimes N} + |1\\rangle^{\\otimes N}\\right)/\\sqrt{2}$, of up to $N=5$ qubits, with a fidelity for the $N=5$ state of $\\mathcal F = \\text{Tr}\\left(\\rho_\\text{ideal}\\rho_{N=5}\\right) = 0.817$. The protocol for generating the GHZ state with $N = 2$ and $N=3$ from  was originally demonstrated by DiCarlo  [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The textbook route to generating the  $N=2$ GHZ state, $|\\Phi^+\\rangle$ (a Bell state) from the all-zero input is\n$$\n\n\\Qcircuit @C=0.5em @R=0.75em{\n\\lstick{|0\\rangle} & \\gate{\\H{}} & \\ctrl{1} & \\qw & \\qw \\\\\n\\lstick{|0\\rangle} & \\qw         & \\targ    & \\qw & \\qw \\gategroup{1}{5}{2}{5}{1em}{\\}}\n}\n\\raisebox{-1em}{\\,\\, = \\,\\,$ |\\Phi^+\\rangle$}\n\n$$\nAn equivalent circuit using  and native single-qubit gates in superconducting qubits is:\n$$\n\n\\Qcircuit @C=0.75em @R=0.75em{\n\\lstick{|0\\rangle}  & \\gate{\\Y{\\pi/2}} & \\qw                &\\ctrl{1} & \\qw                  & \\qw & \\qw \\\\\n\\lstick{|0\\rangle}  & \\qw               & \\gate{\\Y{-\\pi/2}} &\\ctrl{-1}    & \\gate{\\Y{\\pi/2}} & \\qw & \\qw \\gategroup{1}{3}{2}{5}{.7em}{--}\n}.\n\n$$\nBy repeating the operation inside the dashed box on additional qubits, an $N$-qubit GHZ state can be generated[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Since the demonstration of the $N=5$ GHZ state using the  gate, the gate has been deployed to demonstrate several important aspects of quantum information processing using superconducting qubits. A nine-qubit implementation of the five-qubit repetition code (five data qubits + four syndrome qubits)[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] was demonstrated, and the error suppression factor of a single logical quantum bit was shown to increase as the encoding was changed from three data qubits to five data qubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Similarly, in a five qubit processor the three-qubit repetition code with artificially injected errors was demonstrated[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], building on earlier results utilizing a combination of  and  gates to perform parallelized stabilizer readout[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n#### Quantum simulation and algorithm demonstrations using\nAs an example of the utility of the  gate, we briefly discuss a particular demonstration of a digital quantum simulation. In this context, the  gate has been utilized to simulate a two-site Hubbard model with four fermionic modes, using four qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], it is possible to map fermionic operators onto Pauli spin matrices[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. As shown in Ref.Barends2015 a Hubbard model with two fermionic modes, whose Hamiltonian is given by\n$$\n\nH_\\text{Hubbard, two mode} = -t (b^\\dagger_1b_2 + b_2^\\dagger b_1) + U b^\\dagger_1b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_1 b^\\dagger_2b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_2\n\n$$\ncan be written in terms of Pauli operators as,\n$$\n\nH & = \\frac{t}{2}\\left(\\sigma_x \\otimes \\sigma_x+\\sigma_y\\otimes\\sigma_y\\right)\n\\\\\n& + \\frac{U}{4}\\left(\\sigma_z\\otimes\\sigma_z + \\sigma_z\\otimes \\Id + \\Id \\otimes \\sigma_z\\right),\n\n$$\nwhere $U$ is the repulsion energy and $t$ is the hopping strength. Similar to the Heisenberg interaction discussed briefly in Sec. <ref>, it is now a question of producing $\\alpha \\sigma_i\\otimes \\sigma_i$-type interactions, where the prefactor $\\alpha$ can be tuned. Using the $\\CZ{}_\\phi$ version of , a $U_\\text{ZZ}(\\phi) = \\exp\\left(-i\\frac{\\phi}{2} \\sigma_z\\otimes \\sigma_z\\right)$ unitary can be generated via\n$$\n\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n\\Qcircuit @C=0.5em @R=1.3em{\n& \\multigate{1}{U_\\text{ZZ}(\\phi)}  & \\qw \\\\\n& \\ghost{U_\\text{ZZ}(\\phi)}   & \\qw\n}\n& \\raisebox{-1.5em}{=} &\n\\Qcircuit @C=0.5em @R=1em{\n&\\gate{\\X{\\pi}} & \\multigate{1}{\\CZ{}_\\phi}        & \\gate{A_\\pi} & \\multigate{1}{\\CZ{}_\\phi} & \\qw & \\qw\\\\\n& \\qw         & \\ghost{\\CZ{}_\\phi}    & \\gate{A_\\pi} & \\ghost{{\\CZ{}_\\phi}}        & \\gate{\\X{\\pi}} & \\qw\n},\n\\end{tabular}\\label{eq:ZZfromCZ_v1}\n\n$$\nwhere $A_\\pi \\in\\{\\X{\\pi},\\Y{\\pi}\\}$ is used to allow for small and negative angles. Finally, for completeness, we mention an alternative approach to creating $U_\\text{ZZ}$, given by[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n$$\n\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n\\Qcircuit @C=0.5em @R=1.3em{\n& \\multigate{1}{U_\\text{ZZ}(\\phi)}  & \\qw \\\\\n& \\ghost{U_\\text{ZZ}(\\phi)}   & \\qw\n}\n& \\raisebox{-1.5em}{=} &\n\\Qcircuit @C=0.5em @R=1.25em{\n&\\ctrl{1} & \\qw                  & \\ctrl{1} & \\qw \\\\\n& \\targ    & \\gate{\\Z{\\phi/2}}    & \\targ & \\qw\n},\n\\end{tabular}\\label{eq:ZZfromCZ_v2}\n\n$$\nwhich has the benefit of relying on  (through the s), and the angle can be controlled using the single-qubit $\\Z{}$ gates. We refer the interested reader to two reviews on quantum simulations, see e.g. Refs. Buluta2009,Georgescu2014.\n\nThe  gate has also been used in a variety of other contexts, e.g., for calculating the dissociation of diatomic hydrogen ($H_2$) using the variational quantum eigensolver method[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], for feed-forward based teleportation experiments[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], as well as initial steps towards demonstrating quantum supremacy[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and a $2\\times 2$ implementation of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In the field of hybrid semiconducting nanowire/superconducting qubits (known as the \u201cgatemon\" approach[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]), where the qubit frequency is modified by electrostatically changing the density of carriers in a semiconducting region with proximity-induced superconductivity, the  gate was also demonstrated between two nanowire qubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nOne may worry that operating a qubit by moving its frequency can lead to overlap with frequencies already used by other qubits, in a system with multiple qubits. This issue is known as frequency crowding. While the use of asymmetric transmons (with two sweet spots in the range $[-\\Phi_0,+\\Phi_0]$, recall <ref>(c)) may help alleviate some frequency crowding issues, a more long-term strategy is needed. One way to circumvent the problem is to utilize on/off tunable coupling schemes, in which qubits can exchange energy only if a coupler activates the interaction[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. To address this issue in the context of the  gate, Chen [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] demonstrated a device (named \u201cthe gmon\") where the qubit interaction can be tuned with an on/off ratio on the order of 1000, and a  gate fidelity of $\\mathcal F = 0.9907$ was demonstrated.\n\nThis concludes the introduction to the physics and operation of the  gate in its native form. In the remainder of this section we will introduce a few of the microwave-only gates that have been demonstrated in an effort to sidestep the need for local tunability (and the resulting increased sensitivity to noise) as required by the  and  gate.\n\nTwo-qubit gates using only microwaves\n\nOne common (potential) drawback for the  and  gates is that their operation requires flux-tunable qubits. Introducing a new control knob, such as flux control, in turn also introduces a new noise channel for the system. Furthermore, the need for flux-tunability increases the sensitivity of the devices to flux noise by tuning the qubits from their \u201csweet spots\", increases the dephasing rate. From this perspective, one could envision using all-microwave-based gates to remedy these issues. To this end, the cross-resonance (\u201c\") gate was developed for operating fixed-frequency superconducting qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which typically feature longer lifetimes and reduced sensitivity to flux noise.\n\nThe operational principle of the  gate\n\nTo elucidate the operation of the  gate, we briefly revisit the driving Hamiltonian derived in Sec. <ref>. There, we considered only a single qubit. However, if one extends this formalism to two qubits, see Fig. (Figure fig:2qb_CR)(a) denoting the frequency difference by $\\Delta_{12} = \\omega_{\\text{q}1} - \\omega_{\\text{q}2}$ and the coupling by $g\\ll \\Delta_{12}$, and performing a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to go to the dressed state picture, the driving Hamiltonians for qubit 1 and 2 become[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n$$\n\nH_{\\d,1} = \\Omega V_{\\d1}(t)\\left(\\sigma_x\\otimes\\Id + \\nu_1^-\\Id\\otimes\\sigma_x + \\mu_1^{-}\\sigma_z\\otimes\\sigma_x\\right)\\label{eq:CRGambettaStyle}\\\\\nH_{\\d,2} = \\Omega V_{\\d2}(t)\\left(\\Id\\otimes\\sigma_x + \\nu_2^+\\sigma_x\\otimes\\Id + \\mu_2^{+}\\sigma_x\\otimes\\sigma_z\\right)\n\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\n\\mu_i^\\pm &= \\pm\\frac{g}{\\Delta_{12}}\\frac{\\alpha_i}{(\\alpha_i \\mp \\Delta_{12})} \\label{eq:muforCR1}\\\\\n\\nu_i^\\pm &= \\pm\\frac{g}{\\Delta_{12}}\\frac{\\mp \\Delta_{12}}{(\\alpha_i \\mp \\Delta_{12})}\n\n$$\nand $\\Omega V_{\\text{d}i}(t)$ is the driving for qubit $i$. From <ref>, it is evident that if we drive qubit 1 at the frequency of qubit 2, then to qubit 2, this will look like a combination of $\\nu_1^-\\Id\\otimes\\sigma_x$ and $\\mu_1^-\\sigma_z\\otimes\\sigma_x$. This means that the Rabi oscillations of qubit 2 will have a frequency given by\n$$\n\n\\Omega^\\text{Rabi}_{\\text{QB2}} = \\Omega V_{\\text{d}1}\\left(\\nu_1^- + z_1 \\mu_1^-\\right), \\label{eq:CR_rabi}\n\n$$\nwhere $z_1=\\langle\\sigma_z \\Id\\rangle$, and $z_1$ depends on the state of qubit 1. This effect is demonstrated in <ref>(c), where a simulated drive is applied to qubit 1 while the resulting Rabi oscillations in qubit 2 are recorded. We have used typical fixed-frequency transmon parameters from experiments, and we have included a spurious cross-talk term $\\eta = 0.03$.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In <ref>(d), we plot the difference in angle in the $(z,y)$ plane acquired by qubit 2 for different initializations of qubit 1, $\\Delta \\phi = \\phi_{|00\\rangle}^{zy} - \\phi_{|10\\rangle}^{zy}$. For this particular choice of parameters, the cross-resonance gate achieves a $\\pi$-phase shift in $\\approx 200~$ns.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Schematic circuit diagram of two fixed frequency transmons coupled through a resonator yielding an overall coupling coefficient $g$. Qubit 1 driven at the frequency of qubit 2 leads to the  gate. (b) Schematic level diagram of the always-on coupling leading to dressed states $|\\widetilde{01}\\rangle$ and $|\\widetilde{10}\\rangle$ with $\\Delta_{12} = \\omega_1 - \\omega_2$. (c) Simulations of the expectation values of $\\langle \\sigma_z\\rangle$ and $\\langle \\sigma_y \\rangle$ for qubit 2 as a drive at the frequency of qubit 2 is applied to qubit 1.

(d) Difference in angle in the $(z,y)$ plane as a function of length of the applied drive to qubit 1. At approximately 200\u00a0ns $\\pi$-phase shift has been acquired.\n\nThis strategy was first demonstrated using flux-tunable transmons in Ref.Chow2011, where a Bell state with fidelity $\\mathcal F_\\text{bell} = \\langle \\Phi^+|\\rho|\\Phi^+\\rangle = 0.90$ was achieved. Using quantum process tomography the gate fidelity was found to be $\\mathcal F_\\text{QPT} = 0.81$. By moving to fixed-frequency qubits with increased lifetimes, the gate fidelity was increased to $\\mathcal F_\\text{QPT} = 0.98$ (with subtraction of state initialization and measurement errors)[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For completeness, we note that due to the form of the last term in <ref>, the  gate is also sometimes denoted the $\\textsf{ZX}_{\\theta}$ gate. The unitary matrix representaion of the $\\ZX{\\theta}$ gate is\n$$\n\n\\renewcommand*{\\arraystretch}{1.3}\nU_{\\ZX{\\theta}} &= e^{-\\frac{i}{2}\\theta \\sigma_z\\otimes\\sigma_x} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2} & -i\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2} & 0 & 0\\\\\n-i\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2} & \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2} & i\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\\\\n0 & 0 & i\\sin\\frac{\\theta}{2} & \\cos\\frac{\\theta}{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\theta = -\\mu_1^-\\Omega V_{\\text{d}1}(t)$, which can be used to generate a  with the addition of only single-qubit gates,\n$$\n\n\\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n\\Qcircuit @C=0.5em @R=1.9em{\n& \\ctrl{1} &  \\qw \\\\\n& \\targ & \\qw \\\n} & \\raisebox{-1.5em}{=} &\n\\Qcircuit @C=0.5em @R=0.8em{\n&  \\gate{\\Z{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}} &  \\gate{\\ZX{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}} }& \\qw\\\\\n&  \\gate{\\X{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}} &  \\ctrl{-1}    & \\qw\n},\n\\end{tabular}\n\n$$\nup to a phase $e^{i\\pi/4}$.\n\nImprovements to the  gate and quantum error correction experiments using\n\nSince qubit 1 is being driven off-resonance, an ac-Stark shift will add a term $\\propto \\sigma_z \\Id$ to the driving Hamiltonian of qubit 1. The effect of both the spurious ac Stark shift and the direct $\\nu_1^-\\Id\\sigma_x$ single-qubit rotations was studied in Ref.Corcoles2013. By modifying the original $\\CR{}$ protocol to effectively \u201cecho away\" the two unwanted contributions from the $\\sigma_z\\Id$ and $\\Id\\sigma_x$ terms, the fidelity of the  gate was improved to $\\mathcal F_\\text{CR} = 0.8799$[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], using quantum process tomography. Using interleaved randomized benchmarking of this improved \u201cecho-CR\"-gate (e$\\ZX{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$), a gate fidelity of $\\mathcal F_{\\text{e}\\ZX{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}} = 0.9347$ was achieved. This gate implementation was used to demonstrate two-qubit parity measurements in a three-qubit device[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], as well as detecting bit-flip and phase-flip errors in a Bell state encoded in a four-qubit device[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], with gate fidelities from interleaved randomized benchmarking in the range 0.94 to 0.96. Using a similar device, but with five qubits, weight-four parity measurement of the forms $ZZZZ$ and $XXXX$ were demonstrated[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where the crosstalk to qubits not involved in the  gates was studied, leading to the development of a four pulse $\\text{e}\\CR_{\\text{4-pulse}}$ scheme.\n\nBased on improvements in the analysis of the Hamiltonian describing the  drive, Sheldon [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] subsequently demonstrated a version of the  which reduced the gate time to $\\tau = 160$ ns and added an active cancellation tone to the e$\\ZX{}$ previously developed. Using this \u201cactive cancellation echo $\\ZX{}$\" (ace$\\ZX{}$), the fidelity was increased to $\\mathcal F_{\\text{ace}\\ZX{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}} = 0.991$, measured with interleaved randomized benchmarking. The same sequence without active cancellation on the same qubits yielded $\\mathcal F_{\\text{e}\\ZX{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}} = 0.948$. The interested reader may consult the followup theoretical work [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] with more details on the effective Hamiltonian models. Other approaches to fast, high-fidelity cross-resonance gates have also been proposed [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This series of improvements to the original cross-resonance implementation has increased the gate fidelity to beyond the threshold for fault-tolerance in a surface code, with similar quality to the  gate. Although improvements should still be made, with the advent of the  gate, superconducting qubit based quantum computing platforms now offer two entangling two-qubit gates that can be used for implementing surface-code based error correction schemes.\n\nIn the initial experiments using  gates, the gate times were significantly longer than the typical  gate times ($\\tau_{\\CPHASE{}}=30$ \u2013 60 ns and $\\tau_{\\CR} = 300$ \u2013 400 ns), which to a large extent accounts for the observed  gate fidelities. The time scale for  operation is set by the frequency detuning, the anharmonicity, and the coupling strength, through <ref>. This has the unfortunate drawback that if qubits do not have intended frequencies (due to fabrication variation), it will be immediately manifest as longer gate times, and in turn, reduced gate fidelity. As fabrication techniques are becoming more sophisticated and reliable, this problem may be of reduced importance. However, since the coupling in the  scheme is always on, there is an inherent tension between well-isolated qubits for high-fidelity single-qubit operations, and coupling qubits, for fast/high-fidelity two qubit gates.\n\nQuantum simulation and algorithm demonstrations with the  gate\n\nSince the form of the  Hamiltonian ($\\sigma_z\\otimes\\sigma_x$) is not a $(\\sigma_x\\otimes\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y\\otimes \\sigma_y)$-type interaction (leading to  gate) nor is it an the effective $(\\sigma_z\\otimes\\sigma_z)$-type (leading to  gate), one could question its applicability to quantum-simulation-type experiments, which often involves terms of the form $\\sigma_i\\otimes\\sigma_i$. However, by developing a variational quantum eigensolver routine that efficiently generates entangled trial states using just the $\\ZX{}$ interaction, Kandala [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] calculated the ground-state energy for H$_2$, LiH, and BeH$_2$. This experiment was performed on six fixed-frequency qubits, and it employed a technique for compact encoding of the Hamiltonians corresponding to each molecule[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. As of this writing, this experiment represents the largest molecule for which the ground state has been found using a purely quantum processing approach.\n\nThe  gate is also the native two-qubit gate available on the IBM Quantum Experience quantum processor[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which is accesible online. Using the IBM Quantum Experience processor, Takita [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] demonstrated an implementation of a two-logical-qubit (four physical qubit) error detection code [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The implementation was inspired by the proposal of Gottesman[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which proposed a minimal experiment to claim observation of fault-tolerant encodings[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], using a four qubit error detection code in a five qubit setup. Due to constraints on the connectivity, the work by Takita  demonstrated a modified version of the Gottesman encoding, in which two logical qubits are initialized, but only one of them in a fault-tolerant manner. By artificially injecting an error in the state preparation circuit, the authors demonstrate that the probability of correctly preparing a fault tolerant state is greater than the probability of correctly preparing a non-fault-tolerant qubit. This behavior is consistent with expectations for how fault-tolerant encodings work. Simultaneously, Vuillot[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] also used the IBM Quantum Experience machine to study fault-tolerant schemes encoded in that connectivity.\n\nBeyond the applications to error-correction and error-detection, the cross-resonance gate has also been employed in early demonstrations of quantum advantages in machine learning. Rist\u00e9 [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] studied the so-called \u201clearning parity with noise\" problem, in which one attempts to learn a bit-string  by querying an oracle function $f(\\textsf{\\textbf{D}},\\textsf{\\textbf{k}}) = \\textsf{\\textbf{D}}\\cdot\\textsf{\\textbf{k}}\\text{ mod }2$ with a user-input bit-string . In a first implementation of this problem, the authors show that for a specific instance of the bit-string $\\textsf{\\textbf{k}} = \\textsf{11}$, a learner with access to quantum operations needs fewer queries to the function $f$. However, by extending the model of learning parity with noise, the authors demonstrated a consistent advantage of the learner with access to quantum operations[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe  gate was also used to demonstrate the implementation of a supervised learning algorithm where the feature space is encoded as quantum data on the Bloch sphere[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In typical supervised learning, an algorithm is exposed to a training set of labeled data, and is subsequently asked to classify a new, unlabeled set of data[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In the support vector machine (SVM) approach to such problems, the data is then mapped non-linearly onto the so-called \u201cfeature space\", in which the trained algorithm has constructed a separating hyperplane to classify the data. While a full \u201cquantum Support Vector Machine\" proposal exists, the algorithm assumes that the data are already present in a coherent superposition[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Instead, Havlicek [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] proposed, and demonstrated, that mapping the classical data non-linearly onto the Bloch sphere can also be utilized to provide a quantum advantage. For a wider discussion of the important role of quantum data in many quantum machine learning algorithms, the reader is referred to Ref.Biamonte2017\n\nOther microwave-only gates: b, , and\n\nThe  gate (as outlined above) is not the only all-microwave two-qubit gate available. In particular, the  gate[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is an interesting alternative. The  gate directly drives the $|00\\rangle\\leftrightarrow|11\\rangle$ transition, made possible by interactions with the higher levels of the qubit, see Fig. (Figure fig:2qb_GatesLevelDiagram). Usually, the matrix element for such a transition is small (3rd order in the coupling strength), but if the detuning between the qubits is equal to the anharmonicity, the transition rate is enhanced. Applying a sequence of Schrieffer-Wolff transformations to the coupled-qubit system, and using a carefully chosen drive frequency (close to the midpoint of $\\omega_\\text{q1}$ and $\\omega_\\text{q2}$), it can be shown[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] that the drive gives rise to a unitary operator\n$$\n\nU = U_{\\bSWAP{}}(\\theta,\\phi)U_{ZZ}U_{IZ-ZI} \\label{eq:Ub}\n\n$$\nwith\n$$\n\nU_{\\bSWAP{}}(\\theta,\\phi) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos \\theta & 0 & 0 & -ie^{-i2\\phi}\\sin\\theta\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n-ie^{-i2\\phi}\\sin\\theta & 0 & 0 & \\cos \\theta\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\label{eq:UbSWAP}\n\n$$\nThe two unitaries $U_{ZZ}$ and $U_{IZ-ZI}$ only contain terms that commute with $U_{\\bSWAP{}}(\\theta,\\phi)$, and their effects can be offset in post-processing[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In <ref>, $\\phi$ is the phase of the drive relative to the single-qubit drive pulses, and $\\theta = \\Omega_B t$ with\n$$\n\n\\Omega_B = \\frac{-2g\\Omega^2\\left(-g \\gamma \\alpha_\\Sigma+\\gamma^2\\alpha_2(\\alpha_1+\\Delta_{12}) + \\alpha_1(\\alpha_2-\\Delta_{12})\\right)}{(\\alpha_1+\\Delta_{12})(\\alpha_2 -\\Delta_{12})\\Delta_{12}^2},\n\n$$\nwhere $\\Omega$ is the amplitude of the drive, $\\gamma$ is a dimensionless parameter quantifying the coupling coefficient of the drive to qubit 2 in units of coupling strength to qubit 1, and $\\alpha_\\Sigma = \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2$. Explicit derivations leading to <ref> can be found in the supplement of Ref.Poletto2012. By applying $U_{\\bSWAP{}}$ for a time that yields $\\theta = \\pi/2$, and with $\\phi = 0$, the resulting gate is denoted  and can act as the entangling gate (together with single-qubit gates) that forms a universal gate set. Moreover, the power of the  becomes apparent when one applies it for the time that yields $\\theta = \\pi/4$, which from the ground state $|00\\rangle$ directly produces the entangled Bell state $|00\\rangle + e^{i\\phi}|11\\rangle$. In line with the definition of $\\sqrt{\\iSWAP{}}$, this gate is denoted the $\\sqrt{\\bSWAP{}}$. In the work by Poletto [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the fidelity of the  gate was $\\mathcal F_{\\bSWAP{}} = 0.9$ (determined from quantum process tomography). The main source of error was the increased dephasing during the relatively long high-power pulse needed to drive the $|00\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |11\\rangle$ transition. The  gate can be viewed as the superconducting qubit analogue of the M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gate [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In <ref>, we outline the level diagram of two coupled qubits, along with the higher levels of the qubits. The arrows indicate which coupled states are utilized to implement the corresponding gate. As an application of the  gate, Colless [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] used this gate to calculate energies of the excited states of a $H_2$ molecule using a two-qubit transmon processor [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic of the level structure of two coupled qubits (including higher levels) with indication of the transitions utilized in the , ,  and  gate. See text for details. Figure inspired from Ref. Chow2013.\n\nAnother all-microwave gate is the so-called \"microwave-activated \" (or `' for short)[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The  gate is in spirit similar to the  gate, where noncomputational states are used to impact a conditional phase inside the computational subspace. In contrast to , the  gate is implemented without tuning individual qubit frequencies. Rather, the canonical implementation of this gate comprises two fixed-frequency qubits, where the frequencies are carefully designed (and fabricated), such that the $|12\\rangle$ and $|03\\rangle$ levels are resonant. This leads to a splitting of the otherwise degenerate $|02\\rangle\\leftrightarrow|01\\rangle$, and $|12\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |11\\rangle$ transitions. By driving near resonance with the $|n2\\rangle\\leftrightarrow |n1\\rangle$ transition, an effective $\\sigma_z\\otimes \\sigma_z$ interaction is generated. In a setup comprising two fixed-frequency qubits, the  gate was used to implement the unitary\n$$\n\nU_\\textsf{MAP} = \\exp\\left[-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\sigma_z\\otimes \\sigma_z\\right],\n\n$$\nwith a gate fidelity $\\mathcal F_\\textsf{MAP} = 0.87$ (determined via quantum process tomography) in a time $\\tau_\\textsf{MAP} = 514~$ns[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. As the number of qubits in a system increase, one drawback of this gate is the need for a precise matching of higher energy levels across multiple qubits, while simultaneously avoiding spurious couplings to other modes in the system.\n\nThe ,  and  gates all have quite stringent requirements on the spectral landscape of the qubits in order to obtain fast, efficient gate operation. To address this issue, another all-microwave gate was developed, the so-called \u201cresonator induced phase gate\" (\u201c\")[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The  gate operates by coupling two fixed-frequency qubits to a bus cavity, from which they are far detuned. By adiabatically applying and removing an off-resonant pulse to the cavity, the system undergoes a closed loop in phase space, after which the cavity is left unchanged, but the qubits acquire a state-dependent phase. By a careful choice of the amplitude and detuning of the pulse, and taking into account the dispersive shift of the cavity, a  gate can be implemented on the two qubits. This effect was experimentally demonstrated by Paik [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] in a 3D transmon system[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where four qubits are coupled to the same bus. In this setup, the  gate operation results in unitaries with weight on all four qubits simultaenously. In order to isolate just the desired two-qubit coupling terms, Paik   developed a \u201crefocused\"  (r) gate that implements\n$$\n\nU_\\textsf{rRIP} = \\exp\\left[-i \\dot \\theta \\sigma_z \\otimes \\sigma_z t\\right],\n\n$$\nwhere the coupling rate (for an unmodulated drive) scales as\n$$\n\n\\dot \\theta \\propto \\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{|\\Omega V_\\d|}{2\\Delta_\\text{cd}}\\right)^2}_{\\bar n} \\frac{\\chi}{\\Delta_\\text{cd}},\n\n$$\nwhere $\\bar n$ denotes the average number of photons in the bus, $\\chi$ is the dispersive shift, and $\\Delta_\\text{cd}$ is the detuning of the drive (d) from the cavity (c). By choosing $\\dot \\theta t = \\pi/4$, it is possible to implement the $\\CPHASE{}$ gate. The power of the  gate lies in its capability to accommodate large differences in qubit frequencies. To demonstrate this, Paik [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] performed two-qubit randomized benchmarking between pairs of qubits in a four-qubit device with frequency differences spanning $0.38$\u00a0GHz to $1.8$\u00a0GHz, all with fidelities in the range 0.96-0.98 and gate times in the range 285 to 760 ns.\n\nGate implementations with tunable coupling\n\nFinally, we briefly review tunable coupling architectures, which have recently emerged as a promising alternative. The idea is to engineer an effective qubit-qubit coupling $\\widetilde g$ that is tunable (typically by applying a flux), and such gates are referred to as parametric gates. This can be implemented in two different ways: ($i$) The coupling strength between two qubits is tuned by a flux, $g\\rightarrow g(\\Phi(t))$[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], or ($ii$) the resonant frequency of the coupling element is modified $\\omega_\\text{coupler} \\rightarrow\\omega_\\text{coupler}(\\Phi(t))$[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], with a fixed g, leading to an effective time-dependent coupling parameter. When the tunable coupling element is driven at frequencies corresponding to the detuning of the qubits from the coupler, an entangling gate can be implemented.\n\nIn a setup of type $(ii)$, an implementation of the  gate was demonstrated by parametrically driving a flux-tunable coupler between two fixed-frequency qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], yielding a fidelity $\\mathcal F_{\\iSWAP{}} = 0.9823$ (using interleaved randomized benchmarking) in a time $\\tau = 183$\u00a0ns. Similarly, the  (and ) gates were recently demonstrated, using a flux-tunable transmon connecting two fixed-frequency transmons. Driving the flux through the tunable qubit at the sum frequency of the fixed-frequency transmons results in the [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] gate. This parametrically driven approach is generally significantly faster than implementations relying solely on fixed-frequency qubits.\n\nA hybrid approach, in which a combination of tunable and fixed-frequency qubits is used, was recently demonstrated for both  and  gates [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This scheme has no added tunable qubits (or resonators) acting as the coupling element, but rather, relies solely on an always-on capacitive coupling between the qubits, and the effective coupling is roughly half that of the always-on coupling. The operational principle here is to modulate the frequency of the tunable qubit (using local flux control) at the transition frequency correponding to $|01\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |10\\rangle$ for  and $|11\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |02\\rangle$ for . Using interleaved randomized benchmarking, the authors demonstrated $\\mathcal F_{\\iSWAP{}} = 0.94$ ($\\tau = 150$\u00a0ns), and $\\mathcal F^{02}_{\\CPHASE{}} = 0.93$ ($\\tau = 210$\u00a0ns) and $\\mathcal F^{20}_{\\CPHASE{}} = 0.88$ ($\\tau = 290$\u00a0ns), showing a slight asymmetry in the direction in which the  is applied. This hybrid technique was used in Ref.Reagor2018 to demonstrate a four-qubit GHZ state with fidelity $\\mathcal F_\\text{4 qubit GHZ} = 0.79$ (using state tomography). Finally, this gate-architecture was used to demonstrate a hybrid quantum/classical implementation of an unsupervised learning task (determining clustering of data), using nineteen qubits and supplemented by a classical computer as part of the minimization loop [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nQUBIT READOUT\n\nThe ability to perform fast and reliable (high fidelity) readout of the qubit states is an important cornerstone of any quantum processor[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn this section, we give a brief introduction to how readout is performed on superconducting qubits. We start by reviewing the fundamental theory behind dispersive readout \u2013 the most common readout technique used today in the circuit QED architecture \u2013 in which each qubit is coupled to a readout resonator. In the dispersive regime, i.e. when the qubit is detuned from the resonator frequency, the qubit induces a state-dependent frequency shift of the resonator from which the qubit state can be inferred by interrogating the resonator.\n\nDispersive readout allows us to map the quantum degree of freedom of the qubit onto the classical response of the linear resonator, thus transforming the readout optimization process into obtaining the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the microwave signal used to probe the resonator.\n\nWe then provide guidance on how to optimize system parameters to perform high-fidelity, single-shot readout. After choosing parameters, such as resonant frequencies and coupling rates, we address the filter and amplifier circuitry positioned in-between the qubit plane and the data aquisition hardware outside of the dilution refriderator. On this note, we review the basic principles of Purcell filters as well as parametric amplifiers, both of which are necessary to obtain fast, high-fidelity readout in scaled-up quantum processors.\n\n### Dispersive readout\nA quantum measurement can be described as an entanglement of the qubit degree of freedom with a \u201cpointer variable\" of a measurement probe with a quantum Hamiltonian[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], followed by classical measurement of the probe. In circuit QED, the qubit (the quantum system) is entangled with an observable of a superconducting resonator (the probe), see Fig. <ref>(a), allowing us to gain information about the qubit state by interrogating the resonator \u2013 rather than directly interacting with the qubit. Therefore, the optimization of the readout performance is translated to maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio of a microwave probe tone sent to the resonator, while minimizing the unwanted back-action on the qubit.\n\nThe qubit-resonator interaction is described by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], previously introduced in Sec. <ref>,\n\n$$\n\nH_{\\mbox{\\tiny{JC}}} = \\omega_r \\left( a^{\\dagger}a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{\\freq}{2}\\sigma_z + g \\left( \\sigma_{+}a + \\sigma_{-}a^{\\dagger}\\right),\n\\label{Eq:JCH}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_r$ and $\\freq$ denote the resonator and qubit frequencies, respectively, and $g$ is the transverse qubit-resonator coupling rate. The operators $\\sigma_{+}$ and $\\sigma_{-}$ represent the processes of exciting and de-exciting the qubit, respectively.\n\nIn the limit when the detuning between the qubit and the resonator is small compared with their coupling rate, i.e. $\\Delta = |\\freq - \\omega_r| \\ll g$, the energy levels of the two systems hybridize and a vacuum Rabi splitting of frequency $\\sqrt{n}g/\\pi$ opens up, where $n = 1,2,3...$ denotes the resonator mode. In this regime, excitations are coherently swapped between the two systems. Although useful for certain two-qubit gate operations, recall Sec. <ref>, such transverse interactions change the qubit state (since energy is directly exchanged between the resonator and the qubit) and is therefore not desired in the context of quantum non-demolition (QND) readout, in which the outcome of the quantum measurement is not altered in the act of reading out the system.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Simplified schematic of a representative experimental setup used for dispersive qubit readout. The resonator probe tone is generated, shaped and timed using an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), and sent down into the cryostat. The reflected signal $S_{11}$ is amplified, first in a parametric amplifier and then in a low-noise HEMT amplifier, before it is downconverted using heterodyne mixing and finally sampled in a digitizer. (b) Reflected magnitude $|S_{11}|$ and phase $\\theta$ response of the resonator with linewidth $\\kappa$, when the qubit is in its ground state $|0\\rangle$ (blue) and excited state $|1\\rangle$ (red), separated with a frequency $2\\chi/2\\pi$. (c) Corresponding complex plane representation, where each point is composed of the in-plane $\\mbox{Re}[S_{11}]$ and quadrature $\\mbox{Im}[S_{11}]$ components. The highest state discrimination is obtained when probing the resonator just in-between the two resonances, (dashed line in (b)), thus maximizing the distance between the states.\n\nIn the dispersive limit, i.e., when the qubit is far detuned from the resonator compared with their coupling rate $g$ and the resonator linewidth $\\kappa$, $\\Delta \\gg g, \\kappa$, there is no longer a direct exchange of energy between the two systems. Instead, the qubit and resonator push each others' frequencies. To see this, the Hamiltonian can be approximated using second-order perturbation theory[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] in terms of $g/\\Delta$, taken in the limit of few photons in the resonator. This is known as the dispersive approximation, after which the Hamiltonian takes the form\n\n$$\n\nH_{\\text{disp}} = \\bigg( \\omega_r +\\chi\\sigma_z\\bigg) \\left( a^{\\dagger}a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{\\widetilde{\\omega}_{\\text{q}}}{2}\\sigma_z,\n\\label{Eq:JCHdisp}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\chi = g^2/\\Delta$ is the qubit-state dependent frequency shift, a so-called dispersive shift, see Fig. <ref>(b), allowing us to distinguish the two qubit states. This is an asymptotically longitudinal interaction, yielding a QND measurement. Note that, in addition, the qubit frequency also picks up a Lamb shift, $\\widetilde{\\omega}_{\\text{q}} = \\freq + g^2/\\Delta$, induced by the vacuum fluctuations in the resonator. Also note that the dispersive Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) is derived for a two-level atom[In reality, superconducting qubits, just like natural atoms, have higher energy levels. These higher levels are outside of the computational subspace, but need to be taken into account for most qubit simulations to get accurate predictions of frequency shifts.]. Taking the second excited state into account and introducing the anharmonicity $\\alpha = \\omega_{\\text{q}}^{1\\rightarrow 2} - \\omega_{\\text{q}}^{0\\rightarrow 1}$ modifies the expression for the dispersive shift:\n\n$$\n\n\\chi = \\chi_{01} + \\frac{\\chi_{12}}{2} = -\\frac{g_{01}^2}{\\Delta}\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\Delta/\\alpha}\\right),\n\\label{Eq:DispShiftTransmon}\n\n$$\n\nwhich for a transmon qubit with $\\alpha < 0$ implies that the dispersive shift will depend on the detuning. This effect is plotted in Fig. <ref>(a), where the second energy level manifests itself as a second vertical asymptote at $\\Delta/2\\pi = E_C/h$. It is also worth noting that for qubit modalities with positive anharmonicity, e.g. flux qubits, the dispersive shift will also shift the sign[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Dispersive frequency shift $\\chi/2\\pi$ as a function of qubit-resonator detuning $\\Delta/2\\pi$, according to Eq. (<ref>), for a transmon qubit with anharmonicity $\\alpha/2\\pi = -E_C/h = -300\\,$MHz, for qubit-resonator coupling rates $g/2\\pi = 50\\,$MHz (blue) and $g/2\\pi = 100\\,$MHz (red). The two vertical asymptotes at $\\Delta/2\\pi = 0$ and $\\Delta/2\\pi = E_C$ divides the dispersive shift into three regimes; For $\\Delta/2\\pi < 0$, and $\\Delta/2\\pi > E_C/h$, the dispersive shift is negative and $\\chi/2\\pi \\rightarrow 0^{-}$ as $\\Delta\\rightarrow \\pm \\infty$. For $0<\\Delta/2\\pi < E_C/2\\pi$, the dispersive shift $\\chi/2\\pi > 0$. This is called the straddling regime[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. (b) Zoomed-in plot for negative qubit-resonator detuning, the most commonly used operating regime.\n\nIn the small photon-number limit, the interaction term of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) commutes with the qubit observable[This commutation is approximate and has an asyptotic dependence on the qubit-resonator detuning], $\\sigma_z$, resulting in a QND measurement[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This is an important condition for many applications in quantum information processing.\n\nIn the case when the resonator photon number $n = a^{\\dagger}a$ exceeds a critical photon number $n_c \\equiv \\Delta^2/(4g^2)$, the dispersive Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) is no longer a valid approximation[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Therefore, the critical photon number sets an upper bound for the power level of the resonator probe signal to maintain (an approximate) QND measurement[It has been demonstrated that it is still possible to read out the qubit state by applying a very strong resonator drive tone, eventhough this readout scheme is not QND[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]]. This limitation could be lifted by implementing a pure (and not only approximate) QND readout using a manifestly longitudinal coupling between a qubit and the resonator. Several groups are currenly pursuing the implementation of longitudinal readout, in which QND readout could be performed even with larger number of resonator photons, thus improving the SNR[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nWe can also interpret the dispersive qubit-resonator interaction in another way; by rearranging the terms in Eq. (<ref>), we can equivalently write\n\n$$\n\nH_{\\text{disp}} = \\omega_r \\left( a^{\\dagger}a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\bigg( \\freq + \\underbrace{\\frac{g^2}{\\Delta}}_{\\text{Lamb shift}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{2g^2}{\\Delta}a^{\\dagger}a}_{\\text{ac-Stark shift}}\\bigg)\\sigma_z,\n\\label{Eq:JCHdisp2}\n\n$$\n\nwhere the bare qubit frequency is shifted by a fixed amount $g^2/\\Delta$, known as the Lamb shift[It is worth mentioning that the observed qubit frequency is always the Lamb-shifted frequency and not the bare qubit frequency.] as well as an amount proportional to the number of photons populating the resonator[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This effect is known as the ac-Stark shift. It has the consequence that photon number fluctuations (noise) in the resonator induce small shifts of the qubit frequency, slightly bringing the qubit out of its rotating frame and thus causing dephasing[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This means that spurious photon occupation and fluctuation in the resonator, be it thermal or coherent photons, shift the qubit frequency and causing dephasing[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For this reason, it is important to make sure that the processor is properly thermalized[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and its control lines well filtered[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and attenuated[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], to reduce photon number fluctuation.\n\n### Measuring the resonator amplitude and phase\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic of an I-Q mixer. A readout pulse at frequency $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ enters the RF port, where it is equally split into two paths. A local oscillator at frequency $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}$ enters the LO port, where it is equally split into two paths, one of which undergoes a $\\pi/2$-radian phase rotation. To perform analog modulation, the two signals in each path are multiplied at a mixer, yielding the outputs $I(t)$ and $Q(t)$, each having frequencies $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\pm \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}$. $I(t)$ and $Q(t)$ are then low-pass-filtered (time averaged) to yield $I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}(t)$ and $Q_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}(t)$ at the intermediate frequency $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}} = |\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} - \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}|$, and subsequently digitized using an analog-to-digital (ADC) converter. If $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}} \\neq 0$, then digital signals $I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n]$ and $Q_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n]$ are further digitally demodulated using digital signal processing (DSP) techniques to extract the amplitude and phase of the readout signal.\n\nIn the previous section, we outlined the underlying physics behind the dispersive readout technique, in which we concluded that the qubit induces a state-dependent frequency shift of the resonator.\nWe now focus our attention on how to\nprobe the resonator to \u201cread out the qubit,\u201d that is, best distinguish the two classical resonator signatures corresponding to our qubit states, see Fig. <ref>(b)-(c).\n\nThe readout circuit can be set up in measuring either reflection or transmission. The best state discrimination is obtained by maximizing the separation between the two states in the $(I,Q)$-plane, i.e. the in-phase and quadrature component of the voltage, see Fig. <ref>(c). It can be shown that this separation is maximal when the resonator is probed just in-between the two qubit-state dependent resonance frequencies\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RF}}} = (\\omega_{r}^{|0\\rangle} + \\omega_{r}^{|1\\rangle})/2$. In this case, the reflected magnitude is identical for $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, and all information about the qubit state is encoded in the phase $\\theta$, see dashed line in Fig. <ref>(b). In turn, the qubit-resonator detuning should be designed to obey the criterion for maximal state visibility, $\\chi = \\kappa/2$, which is maximized for phase measurements while constraining qubit dephasing.\n\nOnce we have picked the resonator probe frequency, the quantum dynamics of the qubit can be mapped onto the phase of the classical microwave response. In the following, we discuss how we can use heterodyne detection to measure the phase of the resonator response. We assume that the reader is already somewhat familiar with basic mixer operations, such as modulation and de-modulation of signals. For interested readers, we refer to Ref.\u00a0Marki2010.\n\n#### Representation of the readout signal\nA readout event commences with a short microwave tone directed to the resonator at the resonator probe frequency $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$. After interacting with the resonator, the reflected (or transmitted) microwave signal has the form\n\n$$\n\\label{Eq:RO-signal}\ns(t) &= A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\cos(\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}t + \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}), %\\\\\n%     &= A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\cos (\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}) \\cos(\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}t)\n%      - A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\sin (\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}) \\sin(\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}t) \\nonumber\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ is the carrier frequency used to probe the resonator. $A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ are, respectively, the qubit-state-dependent amplitude and phase that we want to measure.\n\nOne can equivalently use a complex analytic representation of the signal,\n$$\n\\label{Eq:analytic-representation}\ns(t) &= \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} e^{j (\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} t + \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}})} \\right\\}, \\\\\n% &= \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\exp^{j \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}} \\exp^{j \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} t}  \\right\\}\n&= \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\cos(\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} t + \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}})\n+ j \\sin (\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} t + \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}) \\right\\} \\nonumber %\\\\\n%     &= \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ I(t) + j Q(t) \\right\\} \\nonumber,\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\operatorname{Re}$ takes the real part of an expression, e.g., $\\operatorname{Re} [\\exp(jx)] = \\operatorname{Re} (\\cos x + j\\sin x) = \\cos x$.\n\nTo gain intuition, we can rewrite Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) in a static \u201cphasor\u201d notation that separates out the time dependence $\\exp(j \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} t)$,\n\n$$\n\\label{Eq:phasor}\ns(t) &= \\operatorname{Re} \\left\\{ \\underbrace{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} e^{j \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}}}_{\\mathrm{phasor}} e^{j \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} t}  \\right\\},\n%&\\rightarrow A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\exp^{j \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}} \\equiv A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\angle \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}},\n\n$$\n\nwhere the phasor $A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\exp(j \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}) \\equiv A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\angle \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ is a shorthand that fully specifies a harmonic signal $s(t)$ at a known frequency $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$.\nTo perform qubit readout, we want to measure the \u201cin-phase\u201d component $I$ and a \u201cquadrature\u201d component $Q$ of the complex number represented by the phasor,\n$$\n\nA_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} e^{j \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}} &=\nA_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\cos \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} + j  A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\sin \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\\\\n&\\equiv I + j Q\n\n$$\nto determine the amplitude $A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ and the phase $\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic of the heterodyne detection technique. (a) The signal with frequency $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RF}}}$ from the cryostat is mixed with a carrier tone with frequency $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}$, yielding two quadratures at a down-converted intermediate frequency $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}} = |\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} - \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}|$, and 90$^{\\circ}$ out-of-phase with each other. (b) The two signals are passed into two different analog-to-digital converter (ADC) channels. To avoid sampling the resonator transient, some readout delay ($\\tau_{rd}$) corresponding to the resonator linewidth may be added, and the two signals are sampled for a time $\\tau_s$. In this case, the white dots represent the sampled points. (c) The sampled traces are post-processed and after some algebra, the sampled data points are averaged into a single point in the $(I,Q)$-plane. To extract statistics of the readout performance, i.e. single-shot readout fidelity, a large number of $(I,Q)$-records are acquired, yielding a 2D-histogram, with a Gaussian distributed spread given by the noise acting on the signal.\n\n#### I-Q mixing\nOne direct means to extract $I$ and $Q$ is to perform a homodyne or heterodyne measurement using an analog I-Q mixer. Figure \u00a0<ref> shows a basic electrical schematic of an I-Q mixer. The readout signal $s(t)$ and a reference local-oscillator signal $y(t)= A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}} \\cos \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}} t$ are fed into the mixer via the RF and LO mixer ports. The mixer then equally splits the signal and local oscillator into two branches and multiplies them in the following way: in the $I$-branch, the signal $s_I(t) = s(t)/2$ is multiplied by the local oscillator $y_I(t)= (A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}/2) \\cos \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}} t$; and in the $Q$-branch, the signal $s_Q(t) = s(t)/2$ is multiplied by a $\\pi/2$-phase-shifted version of the local oscillator, $y_Q(t)= - (A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}/2) \\sin \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}} t$. The \u201c-\u201d sign arises from the choice of using a $A(\\cos \\omega t+\\phi)$ as the reconstructed real signal. At the $I$ and $Q$ ports, the output signals $I(t)$ and $Q(t)$ contain terms at the sum and difference frequencies, generally referred to as an intermediate frequency, $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}} = \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} \\pm \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}$. The resulting signals are low-pass filtered, passing only the terms at the difference frequency, $I_{IF}(t)$ and $Q_{IF}(t)$, which are then digitized. After digital signal processing, one obtains the static in-phase ($I$) and quadrature ($Q$) components, from which one calculates the amplitude $A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ and the phase $\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$.\n\nMicrowave mixers use square-law-type diodes to implement multiplication. The optical analog of a mixer operation is a combination of a balanced (50-50) beamsplitter followed by optical photodetectors, as shown in the inset of Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a). The signal and local-oscillator optical fields are first combined at the beamsplitter, yielding superpositions of both fields, and then detected at the photodetectors, which act as square-law devices. To build intuition for how this works, tbe square of the sum of two electric fields $(E_1 + E_2)^2 = E_1^2 + E_2^2 + 2 E_1E_2$ has a cross term that is the multiplication of the two fields. We refer the reader to Ref.\u00a0Mandel1995 for further details.\n\n#### Homodyne demodulation\nOne direct means to extract $I$ and $Q$ is to perform a microwave homodyne measurement using an analog I-Q mixer of the type shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>.\nIn an analog homodyne measurement, the local oscillator (LO) is chosen to be at the carrier frequency $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}=\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$. Upon mixing, $I(t)$ and $Q(t)$ contain terms at both DC ($\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}=0$) and terms at twice the carrier frequency. Time-averaging (filtering) $I(t)$ and $Q(t)$ directly yield the DC terms $I_{IF}(t) =I$ and $Q_{IF}(t) =  Q$:\n$$\n\nI &= \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T dt \\; s_I(t) y_I(t) \\nonumber\\\\\n%&= \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T dt \\; \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{4} \\cos^2(\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}t) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{8} \\cos (\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}),  \\\\\nQ &= \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T dt \\; s_Q(t) y_Q(t) \\nonumber \\\\\n%&= \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T dt \\; \\frac{-A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{4} \\cos(\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}t) \\sin(\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}t) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{8} \\sin (\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}),\n\n$$\nwhere $T$ is a time interval taken to be an integer number of periods of the readout signal. $I$ and $Q$ are then sampled and used to calculate the amplitude and phase:\n$$\n\nA_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} &\\propto \\sqrt{I^2 + Q^2}, \\\\\n\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} &= \\arctan(Q/I).\n\n$$\n\nNote that the global value of $A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ or $\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ is not what matters; what matters is the change in $A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ between the qubit being in state $\\vline 0 \\rangle$ and state $\\vline 1 \\rangle$. For example, the value of $A$ leaving the resonator and the value $G \\times A$ reaching a measurement stage are different, where $G$ represents the net gain in the measurement amplifier chain. However, the gain is the same, independent of the qubit state, whereas $A$ may be different, e.g., $A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}^{(0)}=G \\times A_{\\lvert 0 \\rangle}$ or $A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}^{(1)}=G \\times A_{\\lvert 1 \\rangle}$. Similarly, the propagation phase $\\phi$ accumulated while a signal travels between the resonator and the measurement stage is also independent of the qubit state, and simply imparts a phase offset to the qubit-induced phase shift, e.g., $\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}^{(0)}=\\theta_{\\lvert 0 \\rangle} + \\phi$ or $\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}^{(1)}=\\theta_{\\lvert 1 \\rangle} + \\phi$.\n\nHomodyning works in principle, but there are two drawbacks. First, signals directly demodulated to DC may be subject to lower signal-to-noise ratios, since they fight against $1/f$ electronics noise, as well as any other noise signals that may have inadvertently been demodulated (e.g., via a square-law detector). The second is that homodyning is not compatible with frequency division multiplexing (FDM), where a single pulse can be used to interrogate $N$ resonators at different frequencies by applying tones at each resonator frequency using the superposition principle, e.g.,\n$$\n\ns(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^N A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}^{(i)} \\cos(\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}^{(i)}t + \\theta^{(i)}).\n\n$$\nHomodyning an FDM signal will put all resonator signals at DC, and once downconverted, they cannot be differentiated.\nTo work around this, it is generally advantageous to use heterodyning, which uses a two-step demodulation process via an intermediate frequency $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}$. Such a scheme is easily compatible with the concept of FDM, because a readout signal is first demodulated to unique IF frequencies  $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}^{(i)}$, and then digitally demodulated to extract each $A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}^{(i)}$ and $\\theta^{(i)}$.\nIn the following, we will consider $N=1$ for simplicity, but the process is applicable to larger $N$ provided the frequencies a sufficiently spaced to avoid interference with one another during the demodulation process.\n\n#### Heterodyne demodulation\nIn a heterodyne scheme, a local oscillator at frequency $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}$ is offset by an intermediate frequency $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}$ to target a unique readout frequency $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$. Up-conversion techniques such as single-sideband modulation with suppressed carrier (SSB-SC) using balanced I-Q mixers (operated in reverse compared with Fig.\u00a0<ref>) are commonly used to create such readout signals. We refer the reader to Ref.\u00a0Marki2010 for more information on how to create such pulses.\n\nHere, we want to extract $A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ (or their scaled and offset versions) from the reflected/transmitted tone using a heterodyning scheme. The first step is to perform analog I-Q mixing, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(a).\n\nIn contrast to the homodyning case, here, the local oscillator and readout tone are at different frequencies, $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}} = |\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}} - \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}| > 0$. Mixing the LO and RO signals yields the signals $I(t)$ and $Q(t)$ with terms at both sum and difference frequencies. Filtering out the sum frequencies using low-pass filtering (time averaging) yields the IF signals:\n$$\n\nI_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}(t) &= \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T (dt) \\; s_I(t) y_I(t) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{8} \\cos (\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}t + \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}) \\\\\nQ_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}(t) &= \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T (dt) \\; s_Q(t) y_Q(t) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{8} \\sin (\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}t + \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}).\n\n$$\n\nAs before, we have omitted any offset phases from the LO or from the wave propagation between the resonator and the measurement. Again, these offset values are not what matters; it is the change in $A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ with a change in qubit state that allows state discrimination.\n\nThe analog-demodulated $I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}(t)$ and $Q_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}(t)$ are now oscillating at a frequency that is generally low enough to be digitized using commonly available analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The resulting digital signals are now written as $I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n]$ and $Q_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n]$,\n\n$$\n\nI_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n] &= \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{8} \\cos (\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}n + \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}) \\\\\nQ_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n] &= \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{8} \\sin (\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}n + \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}),\n\n$$\n\nwhere $n=t/\\Delta t$ indexes the sample number of the continuous-time signals $I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}(t)$ and $Q_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}(t)$, $\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}} = \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}} \\Delta t$ is the digital frequency, and $\\Delta t$ is the sampling period (typically around 1 ns). Pulsing the resonator is necessarily accompanied by a ring-up time, related to the quality factor of the resonator, and the first few samples may decrease overall signal-to-noise. Consequently, a delayed window of samples $[n_1:n_2]$ is often used to perform the second digital demodulation of the discrete-time signals $I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n_1:n_2]$ and $Q_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n_1:n_2]$. Note that more complicated windowing functions may also be used to improve state discrimination, but here we use a simple boxcar [see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b)].\n\nDigital demodulation comprises the point-by-point multiplication of $I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n_1:n_2]$ and $Q_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n_1:n_2]$ by $\\cos \\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}} n$ and $\\sin \\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}} n$. Averaging the resulting time series eliminates the  $2\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}$ component while retaining the DC component, as in a homodyne measurement, one obtains\n$$\n\nI &= \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{n_1}^{n_2} I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n] \\cos[\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}} n]\n= \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{16} \\cos \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}, \\\\\nQ &= \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{n_1}^{n_2} Q_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n] \\sin[\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}} n]\n= \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{16} \\sin \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}},\n\n$$\nwhere $M=n_2-n_1+1$. As before, $I$ and $Q$ can then be used to find $A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}$.\n\nThe same procedure may be view in the complex $I-Q$ plane by the analytic function $z_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n]$, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c-d),\n$$\n\nz_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n] &= I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n]  + j Q_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n] \\equiv V_{I}[n] + j V_Q[n] \\\\\n&= \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{8}\n\\left[ \\cos (\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}n + \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}) +  j \\sin (\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}n + \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}) \\right] \\\\\n%&= \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{8} e^{j\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}n + \\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}} \\\\\n&= \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{8} e^{j\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}} e^{j\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}n}\n%         \\cos[\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}} n]   \\sin[\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}} n]\n\n$$\nwhere the digital in-phase and quadrature signals are represented here as the voltages $V_{I}[n]$ and $V_Q[n]$ sampled by the ADC, and we have separated the static phasor $(A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}/8) \\exp[j\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}]$ from the rotating term $\\exp[j\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}n]$. One can digitally demodulate the  time series $z_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n]$ by multiplying by the complex conjugate of the oscillatory exponential,\n$$\n\nz[n] &= z_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}[n].*e^{-j\\Omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{IF}}}n} %\\\\\n%      &= \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{8} e^{j\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}} v[n]\n\n$$\nwhere $.*$ indicates a point-by-point multiplication, and the result is a vector of length $M$ of nominally identical values of the phasor \u2013 one for each sample point \u2013 with a small amount of additive noise due to noise in measurement chain, digitization errors, etc. A singular phasor value is then estimated by taking average,\n$$\n\n\\bar{z}[n] &= \\frac{1}{M} \\sum z[n]  \\\\\n&= \\frac{A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}A_{\\mbox{\\tiny{LO}}}}{8} e^{j\\theta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RO}}}}.\n\n$$\nSuch \u201csingle-shot measurements\u201d may then be repeated a large number of times to obtain an ensemble average $\\langle \\bar{z}[n] \\rangle$.\n\n### Weak and strong qubit measurements: Impact of noise\nIn quantum measurements, noise plays an essential role as it dictates the fidelity of its outcome[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], recall Fig. <ref>(c). In the absence of noise, any non-zero dispersive shift (resulting in a resonator field displacement) would suffice to unambigously separate the qubit states, given a properly chosen resonator linewidth. In practice, however, the outcome of the quantum measurement is generally Gaussian distributed in the $(I,Q)$-plane due to presence of classical and quantum noise. In this section, we review the main sources of noise, as well as how it impedes our ability to extract information from the quantum system. For a rigorous discussion of noise and quantum measurements, the interested reader is referred e.g. to the work by Clerk et al[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and to the textbook by Haus[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe total noise added to the signal has multiple origins. One part of the noise is associated with the microwave signal used to probe the resonator, where each photon has an intrinsic quantum noise power of $\\hbar\\omega/2$ per unit bandwidth. Another contribution comes from the phase-preserving amplifiers, adding both classical noise and at least $\\hbar\\omega/2$ of noise as required by Heisenberg's uncertainty relation. Finally, any attenuation of the signal prior to the first amplifier will appear as added noise. Combined, these noise sources amount to a system noise temperature, which can be characterized using a sensitive thermometer, such as a shot-noise tunnel junction[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] or a qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] as a sensor.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Qubit state distribution throughout the course of sampling the readout signal, in the presence of noise. The separation between the peaks (solid lines) increases linearly in time, whereas the peak widths only increase as $\\sqrt{t}$. Image inspired by Clerk et al[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The three black arrows represent line cuts for three sampling times: (b) For short sampling time, the states are not separated, resulting in a weak meaurement ($\\mbox{SNR} < 1$). (c) After a longer sampling time, the peaks starts to get separated, (d) finally getting fully resolved, resulting in a strong measurement ($\\mbox{SNR} > 1$).\n\nThe noise results in time-dependent fluctuations of the measured signal, which in turn translates into uncertainty in our demodulated signals, see Fig. <ref>(c). This can be intuitively understood by considering that our heterodyne detection method requires us to sample for a finite amount of time.\n\nTo quantify the impact of the noise on our measurement, we first project the distributed $(I,Q)$ data \u2013 corresponding to $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ \u2013 onto the axis for which their relative separation in the complex plane is maximized[When analyzing the readout data, we have the freedom to choose projections.]. The line that is used to separate between $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ is called a separatrix.\n\nThe noise can now be quantified by comparing the widths of the Gaussian probability distribution surrounding the mean with the peak separation in the $(I,Q)$-plane, thus defining a signal-to-noise ratio $\\mbox{SNR} = \\delta\\theta/(\\Delta\\theta_{1} + \\Delta\\theta_{0})$, see Fig. <ref>(a), with $\\delta\\theta = |\\theta_{1} - \\theta_{0}|$ representing the signal and $\\Delta\\theta_0$, $\\Delta\\theta_1$ represent the noise (2$\\sigma$) of each distribution. The SNR allows us to distinguish between a weak and a strong quantum measurement, as illustrated in Fig. <ref>(b)-(d).\n\nIn a weak measurement, the probabilities are broadly distributed as compared to their relative separation ($\\mbox{SNR} < 1$), which means that only partial information of the quantum state is revealed to the observer, see Fig.<ref>(b). In a strong measurement, on the other hand, the quantum state is collapsed onto one of the two eigenstates. In this case, the outcome of the measurement can be distinguished unambigously, which is reflected in two fully separated distributions ($\\mbox{SNR} > 1$), see Fig. <ref>(d).\n\nIn many applications of quantum measurements, it is necessary to unambigously (and with high fidelity) tell the outcome without repeating the readout measurement. This is known as single-shot readout and it often requires the use of a parametric amplifier \u2013 a preamplifier used to increase system SNR \u2013 which is further discussed in Sec. <ref>.\n\nAssuming that the widths of the two distributions are identical, $\\Delta\\theta_0 = \\Delta\\theta_1 = \\Delta\\theta$, the separation error can be calculated by deriving the weight of the overlapping region of the Gaussian distributions as[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n\n\u03f5_ = 1/\u221a(2\u03c0(\u0394\u03b8)^2)\u222b_\u03b8 = \u03b8_0 - \u03b8_1/2^\u221eexp[-(\u03b8 - \u03b8_1)^2/2(\u0394\u03b8)^2]d\u03b8\n\n$$\n\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{erfc}\\left[ \\frac{\\left| \\theta_0 - \\theta_1\\right|}{2\\sqrt{2(\\Delta\\theta)^2}}\\right],\n\\label{Eq:EpsilonError}\n\n$$\n\nwhere erfc(x) denotes the complementary Gaussian error function, defined as\n\n$$\n\n\\mbox{erfc}(x) = 1 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_{x}^{\\infty}e^{-t^2}dt.\n\\label{Eq:EpsilonError2}\n\n$$\n\nUsing the erfc in Eq. (<ref>), the separation error in Eq. (<ref>) can be compactly expressed in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio,\n\n$$\n\n\\epsilon_{\\mbox{\\tiny{sep}}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{erfc}\\left[\\frac{\\mbox{SNR}}{2}\\right]\n\\label{Eq:EpsilonError3}\n\n$$\n\nNote, however, that the separation error between the two state distributions only tells us the signal-to-noise ratio of our detection scheme. On top of the separation error, fidelity is reduced if the qubit relaxes (or is excited) during the readout. This will result in a count on the \u201cwrong\" side of the threshold. This leads to an additional constraint on the readout; The readout cycle needs to be completed on a timescale much shorter than the qubit relaxation time.\n\nIn summary, we see that to optimize the qubit readout fidelity, the readout needs to fulfill the following two requirements:\n\n* Fast readout: The readout cycle needs to be completed within a time that is short compared with the qubit coherence time. The longer the readout time, the more likely the qubit is to relax, thus reducing readout fidelity.\n\n* High signal-to-noise ratio: The signal-to-noise ratio needs to be sufficiently large to suppress the state separation errors below an acceptable limit where it does not limit the readout fidelity.\n\nIn sections <ref> and <ref>, we review how these two conditions are met by carefully engineering the signal path of the readout circuitry.\n\n\u00a7.\u00a7  \u201cPurcell filters\" for faster readout\n\nTo ensure high-fidelity readout performance, it is important to perform single-shot readout at a timescale much shorter than the qubit coherence time, $\\tau_{ro} \\ll T_1$. This motivates us to: (i) make the resonator linewidth wide, thus reducing its ring-up time, $\\tau_{rd}$, and (ii) keep the integration time $\\tau_s$ as short as possible, see Fig.<ref>(b). The ability to isolate a quantum system from decohering into its environment while, at the same time, being able to read out its state in a short time represents two contradictory criteria, which must be traded-off[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nEven though dispersive readout (in the few-photon limit) has only a small back-action on the qubit state, the qubit will still suffer from $T_1$-relaxation while we are performing a measurement. In fact, this \u201cdecay during the readout\" often limits the readout fidelity, reducing it to\n\n$$\n\nF(\\tau_{ro}) = 1-e^{-\\tau_{ro}/T_1},\n\\label{Eq:FTauRO}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\tau_{ro} = \\tau_{rd} + \\tau_{s}/2$ denotes the total time for the readout, consisting of the readout delay $\\tau_{rd}$ due to the resonator transient, and half the sampling time $\\tau_{s}/2$. The fidelity drop in Eq. (<ref>) can be interpreted as a manifestation of the competition between the time scales at which our quantum information reaches our detector or the environment first.\n\nThe limitation of qubit coherence originates from an enhanced spontaneous emission of photons, induced by its environment. This is known as the Purcell effect[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and is an important consideration when designing qubit-resonator systems[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The portion of spontaneous emission that is mediated by the resonator describes how qubit relaxation is enhanced by the resonator Q when on-resonance, and suppressed off-resonance. The aim of this section is twofold: first, we develop an intuition for how the Purcell decay limits qubit coherence, and second, how to properly mitigate this limitation by designing a so-called Purcell filter, which modifies the impedance seen by the qubit through the readout resonator. This allows us to maintain fast readout, while protecting the qubit from relaxing into its environment.\n\nIf we would just choose qubit and resonator operation frequencies guided by the resonator linewidth $\\kappa$, qubit-resonator coupling $g$, and the amount of dispersive shift $\\chi$, we would reduce the detuning between the qubit and the resonator, thus maximizing the dispersive shift (recall Fig. <ref>). However, this presents a trade-off between two important system parameters; on one hand, we want the qubit to be isolated from the resonator environment off-resonant to avoid Purcell-enhanced decay. On the other hand, looking at the dispersive shift, we want the two rates, $g$ and $\\kappa$ to be strong, yielding larger dispersive shift as well as short resonator transient and thus a faster readout.\n\nFortunately, when operating in the dispersive regime, the qubit and resonator are far detuned from each other $\\Delta \\gg g,\\kappa$, which means that their impedance (environment) can be independently engineered through filter design. In essence, one designs a filter to have strong coupling to the readout port at the resonator frequency (large $\\kappa$), but isolates the qubit from its environment at the qubit frequency[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In other words, an impedance transformation.\n\nDepending on the design of the readout for the quantum processor to which the filter should be coupled, there are different ways to design a Purcell filter; such as quarter-wave stubs[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], low-Q bandpass filters[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and stepped-impedance filters[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Which one is optimal depends on system properties such as qubit-resonator detunings, required bandwidth, and allowed insertion loss.\n\nThe most promising Purcell filter designs are the ones that allow for frequency multiplexing, such as the low-Q bandpass filter design[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which in addition to Purcell filtering has the function of a quantum bus, connecting several frequency-multiplexed readout resonators sharing the same amplifier chain.\n\nThe Purcell effect can be framed in terms of Fermi's golden rule, where noise in the environment causes the qubit to decay with some probability. We can gain intuition about the Purcell effect (as well as how the qubit can be protected from it) by replacing the Josephson junction in the qubit circuit with an ac-current source, outputting $I(t) = I_0\\sin(\\omega t)$, with $I_0 = e\\omega$ and study the rate at which power is lost into an environmental load resistor $R = Z_0 = 50\\,\\Omega$, see Fig. <ref>(a).\n\nExpressing the power lost in the resistor as $P = I_{0}^2(C_g/C_{\\Sigma})^2R = (e \\omega \\beta)^2Z_0$, with $\\beta = C_g/C_{\\Sigma}$, the qubit Purcell decay rate into the continuum can be written as\n\n$$\n\n\\gamma^{\\text{Purcell}}_{\\text{env}} = \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{P}{\\hbar \\omega} = \\frac{(\\beta e \\omega)^2 Z_0}{\\hbar \\omega} = \\frac{g^2}{\\omega}.\n\\label{Eq:Decay1}\n\n$$\n\nTo protect the qubit from decaying into the 50$\\,\\Omega$ environment (as well as for deploying our dispersive readout) we can now add a resonator in parallel with the qubit, see Fig. <ref>(b). The presence of the resonator has the effect of shaping the impedance at the qubit frequency, which in turn modifies the decay rate in Eq. (<ref>) into\n\n$$\n\n\\gamma^{\\text{Purcell}}_{\\text{res-env}} = \\frac{g^2}{\\omega}\\frac{\\mbox{Re}[Z_r(\\omega)]}{Z_0},\n\\label{Eq:Decay2}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $Z_r(\\omega)$ denotes the impedance of the shunted resonator. We can express the real-part of the impedance in terms of the resonator quality factor $Q = \\omega_r/\\kappa$ and qubit-resonator detuning $\\Delta = \\omega_{q} - \\omega_{r}$,\n\n$$\n\n\\mbox{Re}[Z_r(\\omega)] = \\frac{QZ_0}{1 + 2(\\Delta/\\kappa)^2}.\n\\label{Eq:Decay3}\n\n$$\n\nNow, by substituting Eq. (<ref>) into Eq. (<ref>), we see that the Purcell decay rate for the qubit depends on the detuning between the resonator and the qubit. This is intuitive, since the resonator can be thought of as a bandpass filter, with center frequency $\\omega_r$ and bandwidth $\\kappa$. For resonant condition, i.e. when $\\Delta = 0$, the emission rate into the resonator takes the form\n\n$$\n\n\\gamma^{\\text{Purcell}}_{\\text{res-env}} = \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{r}}\\frac{\\mbox{Re}[Z_r]}{Z_0} \\underset{\\Delta=0}{=} \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{r}}Q = \\frac{g^2}{\\kappa}.\n\\label{Eq:Decay4}\n\n$$\n\nIn the dispersive regime $\\Delta \\gg g,\\kappa$, which is also relevant for us in the context of qubit readout, we can make the approximation $\\mbox{Re}[Z_r] \\approx QZ_0 (\\kappa/\\Delta)^2$, yielding the familiar expression for the Purcell decay rate in circuit QED[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n\n$$\n\n\\gamma^{\\text{Purcell}}_{\\text{res-env}} = \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{r}}\\frac{\\mbox{Re}[Z_r]}{Z_0} \\underset{\\Delta\\gg g,\\kappa}{=} \\frac{g^2}{\\omega_{r}}Q \\left(\\frac{\\kappa}{\\Delta}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{g}{\\Delta}\\right)^2\\kappa.\n\\label{Eq:Decay5}\n\n$$\n\nThe relation for the Purcell limit in Eq. (<ref>) thus provides us with a useful guide on how to design the coupling rates $g$ and $\\kappa$, as well as how large qubit-resonator detuning $\\Delta$ is necessary to avoid the Purcell limit.\n\nIn recent years, however, the intrinsic coherence times for superconducting qubits have reached above $100\\,\\mu$s, recall Sec. <ref>, imposing practical limitations on how to simultaneously optimize $g$ and $\\kappa$, to render fast readout without compromising the qubit coherence. Considering the parameters in Eq. (<ref>), it is not possible to just increase the bound on the relaxation time $T_1$, without at the same time trading off the readout speed and contrast.\n\nWe can now introduce the Purcell filter [Fig. <ref>(c-d)] in between the readout resonator and the $50\\,\\Omega$ environment, leading to a reduction of the decay rate according to[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n\n$$\n\n\\gamma^{\\text{Purcell}}_{\\text{res-filter-env}} = \\kappa\\bigg(\\frac{g}{\\Delta}\\bigg)^2 \\bigg( \\frac{\\freq}{\\omega_r}\\bigg)\\bigg(\\frac{\\omega_r}{2Q_F\\Delta}\\bigg),\n\\label{Eq:Purcell}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $Q_F$ denotes the quality factor of the Purcell filter. This is schematically depicted in Fig. <ref>(d), where the Purcell filter is placed around the resonator frequency, while far detuned from the qubit.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Circuit representation of qubit (orange) coupled to an environment (blue) with a load resistor, $Z_0$, via a capacitor $C_g$. To study the decay rate, the Josephson junction has been replaced with a current source, $I(t)$. (b) By adding a resonator (red) with frequency $\\omega_r$ in-between the qubit and the $50\\,\\Omega$ environment, we get the case found in regular dispersive readout. (c) A Purcell-filter (green) is added to the circuit, providing protection for the qubit, while allowing the resonator field to decay fast to the environment. (d) Transmission spectrum of a Purcell filter (dashed green), centered around the resonator frequency (red arrow), whereas the qubit frequency (orange arrow) is far detuned.\n\n### Improve signal-to-noise ratio: Parametric amplification\nIn light of the aforementioned limited signal-to-noise ratio associated with the low photon number of the dispersive qubit readout, and the short sampling time, the noise temperature of the amplifier chain plays a crucial role in determining the fidelity of the measurement.\n\nA useful benchmark for quantum measurements is the quantum efficiency, defined as\n\n$$\n\n\\eta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{SQL}}} = \\frac{\\hbar \\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RF}}}}{k_B T_{\\mbox{\\tiny{sys}}}}, \\hspace{0.5cm} 0< \\eta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{SQL}}} < 1,\n\\label{Eq:Eta}\n\n$$\n\nwhich quantifies the photon energy to the system noise temperature $T_{\\mbox{\\tiny{sys}}}$, thus yielding a measure of how close the signal is to the standard quantum limit (SQL), as imposed by Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, adding 1/2 photon of noise when $\\eta_{\\mbox{\\tiny{SQL}}}$ approaches unity. Since the energy of each microwave photon is much smaller than that of optical photons, it is not easy to build a single-photon detector operating in the microwave domain[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Instead, for heterodyne detection in circuit QED, a set of cascaded microwave amplifiers are used. The system noise temperature for the amplifier chain can be expressed in terms of the individual gain figures $G_n$ and noise temperatures $T_{N,n}$ of each constituent amplifier[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n\n$$\n\nT_{\\text{sys}} = T_{N,1} + \\frac{T_{N,2}}{G_1} + \\frac{T_{N,3}}{G_1 G_2} + ...\n\\label{Eq:NoiseTemperature}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $n = 1,2,3,...$ denotes the order of the amplifiers, starting from the qubit chip. From Eq. (<ref>), we see that the noise temperature $T_{\\text{sys}}$ is dominated by the noise contribution from the first amplifier, whereas the gain of the first amplifier has the effect of suppressing the noise from the second amplifier, and so on. If the first amplifier is a low-noise high-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier ($T_N \\approx 2\\,$K), the system noise temperature when implemented in a cryostat is around 7-10$\\,$K, corresponding to around 10-20 added photons of noise per signal photon around 5 GHz. In practice, this is generally too much noise to perform single-shot readout.\n\nThis inherently poor signal-to-noise ratio has revived interest in developing quantum-limited parametric amplifiers (PA) \u2013 tailored for readout of superconducting qubits \u2013 featuring the ability to amplify small microwave signals, and adding only approximately the minimum amount of noise allowed by quantum mechanics[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n#### Quantum-limited amplification processes\nIn a linear, phase-insensitive amplifier, an input state $\\langle a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}\\rangle$ is amplified to an output state $\\langle a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{out}}}\\rangle$, with an amplitude gain factor $\\sqrt{G}$. Microwaves are electromagnetic fields and therefore considered to be coherent light comprising microwave photons. As such, they must obey the commutation relations[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n\n$$\n\n[a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}},a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}^{\\dagger}] = [a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{out}}},a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{out}}}^{\\dagger}] = 1,\n\\label{Eq:Commutation}\n\n$$\n\nfrom which it can be shown that it is not possible to simultaneously amplify both quadratures of $a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}$ without also adding noise. This is known as Caves theorem after the work by Caves[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], based on earlier work by Haus and Mullen[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This can be seen by considering the scattering relation between the input and output microwave fields\n\n$$\n\na_{\\mbox{\\tiny{out}}} = \\sqrt{G}a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}.\n\\label{Eq:GainRelationNoIdler}\n\n$$\n\nThe gain relation in Eq. (<ref>) constitutes our ideal scenario for an amplifier process. However, the problem is that that this relation does not satisfy the commutation relation in Eq. (<ref>). To satisfy this relation, we need to also take into account the vacuum fluctuations of another mode[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] \u2013 called the idler mode $b_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}$, also satisfying the same communtation relation $[b_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}},b_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}^{\\dagger}] = 1$. To satisfy the commutation relation, the idler mode is amplified by the gain factor $\\sqrt{G-1}$. For large gain, it can be shown that a minimum amount of half a photon of noise $\\hbar \\omega/2$ needs to be added to a signal amplified with gain $\\sqrt{G}$.\n\nFinally, taking the idler mode into account, the scattering relation for the coherent output field takes the form\n\n$$\n\na_{\\mbox{\\tiny{out}}} = \\underbrace{\\sqrt{G}a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{Amplification}}} + \\underbrace{\\sqrt{G - 1}b_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}^{\\dagger}}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{Added idler noise}}}.\n\\label{Eq:GainRelation}\n\n$$\n\nGenerally, this process results in a so-called phase-insensitive parametric amplification process, in which both quadratures of the input field gets equally amplified. This is illustrated in Fig. <ref>, where the in-phase ($I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}$) and quadrature ($Q_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}$) components of the fields are plotted, before and after the parametric amplifier.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic illustration of a quantum-limited, phase-preserving parametric amplification process of a coherent input state, $a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}} = I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}} + iQ_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}$. (a) The state is centered at $(\\langle{I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}}\\rangle,\\langle{Q_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}}\\rangle)$ and has a noise represented by the radii of the circles along the real and imaginary axes, respectively. (b) Scattering representation of parametric mixing, where the signal and pump photons are interacting via a purely dispersive nonlinear medium. (c) In the case of phase-preserving amplification, both quadratures get amplified by a factor $\\sqrt{G}$, while (in the ideal case) half a photon of noise gets added to the output distribution (blue). Image inspired by Flurin[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nConsidering the amplification process in Eq. (<ref>), we can find a special case for the idler mode, for which noiseless amplification can be accomplished for one of the two quadratures, but at the expense of adding more noise to the other, thus not violating Heisenberg's uncertainty relation for the two field quadratures. This mode of operation is known as phase-sensitive amplification, and is obtained when the idler mode oscillates at the same frequency as the signal (or a multiple thereof), but can be shifted with an overall phase $\\phi \\in [0,2\\pi]$. By substituting the idler mode in Eq. (<ref>) with $b_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}} = e^{i\\phi}a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}$, the scattering relation becomes\n\n$$\n\na_{\\mbox{\\tiny{out}}} = \\underbrace{\\sqrt{G}a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{Amplification}}} + \\underbrace{e^{-i\\phi}\\sqrt{G - 1}a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}^{\\dagger}}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{Phase-dep. noise}}}.\n\\label{Eq:GainRelation2}\n\n$$\n\nThe overall phase factor allows us to tune the orientation of the amplification (or de-amplification) by means of the pump phase, thus allowing us to choose a quadrature for which we want to reduce the noise, see Fig. <ref>. Intuitively, this can be understood by considering the interference that occurs when two waves with the same frequency are confined in space, where we obtain constructive or destructive interference, depending on the phase between the two waves. Due to this interference, the noise can be suppressed even below the standard quantum limit (without violating Heisenberg's uncertainty relation). This is known as single-mode squeezing and was first observation in superconducting circuits by Yurke et al.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In particular, after the theoretical prediction by Gardiner[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], Murch et al. showed that the coherence time of a qubit can be enhanced when the qubit is exposed to squeezed vacuum[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Also two-mode squeezing was demonstrated by Eichler et al.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where the demodulation setup squeezes both quadratures of the acquired signal[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn the context of qubit readout, however, phase-sensitive amplification tends to be experimentally inconvenient. This is mainly due to its phase-dependent gain, which imposes stringent requirements on continuous phase-calibration of the readout signal.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nPhase-sensitive parametric amplification. (a) In contrast to the phase-insensitive operation, phase-sensitive parametric amplification allows us to suppress the noise along one axis. Consequently, the noise is added to the other quadrature. (b) Voltage gain as a function of pump-phase angle, in which the amplification depends on the phase of the pump, providing either amplification or de-amplification of the quadrature voltage.\n\nFor a detailed theoretical framework developed for quantum limited amplification, the reader is referred to earlier work by Roy and Devoret[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], Clerk et al.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and Wustmann and Shumeiko[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n#### Operation of Josephson parametric amplifiers\nIn this section, we review the basic operation characteristics of parametric amplifiers, and in particular the Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs), that have been exploited for qubit readout. Although many different flavors of parametric systems exist, we here focus on the resonant implementations of the Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA), serving as a good system for reviewing the fundamental concepts around parametric amplification.\n\nAll parametric amplifiers operate based on one fundamental principle: the incoming signal photons are mixed with an applied pump tone via an intrinsic nonlinearity, by which energy from the pump is converted into signal photons and thereby providing gain. As we recall from Sec. <ref>, such a nonlinearity can be engineered in the microwave domain using Josephson junctions[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and the resonant parametric amplifiers are built from slightly anharmonic oscillators.\n\nThe first Josephson parametric amplifiers were built from a coplanar waveguide resonator, made nonlinear by adding a nonlinear Josephson contribution to its total inductance, see Fig. <ref>(a). The word parametric refers to the process of modulating (or pumping) one of the parameters of the system's equation-of-motion (such as frequency or damping) in time[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The natural way to perform this parametric pumping is to modulate the nonlinear Josephson inductance, which in turn has the effect of modulating the resonator frequency $\\omega_r(t) = 1/\\sqrt{L(t)C}$.\n\nDepending on how the pumping is implemented, there are two different mixing processes that can be exploited in Josephson parametric amplifiers, which determines the characteristics of the amplifier. These are illustrated in Fig. <ref>(b)-(c) and are referred to as current-pumping[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and flux-pumping[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], respectively. The type of mixing process that takes place depends on the leading order of the nonlinearity of the system, as reflected in its Hamiltonian. In the following, we briefly review the difference between these two pump-schemes.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nCircuit schematics and pump schemes of a Josephson parametric amplifier. (a) The device consists of a quarter-wavelength resonator (blue), represented as lumped elements, shorted to ground via a Kerr-nonlinearity consisting of two parallel Josephson junctions (orange) forming a SQUID. The pump (red) can be applied in two ways; (b) either by modulating the current through the junctions (four-wave mixing) at the resonant frequency, $\\omega_p \\approx \\omega_r$, or (c) by modulating the ac-flux $\\Phi_{\\mbox{\\tiny{ac}}}$ around a static dc-flux point $\\Phi_{\\mbox{\\tiny{dc}}}$ using a separate fast-flux line (three-wave mixing). The flux pump is applied at twice the resonant frequency, $\\omega_p \\approx 2\\omega_r$.\n\nIn the current-pumped case, the dynamics of the system has characteristics of a Duffing oscillator[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], with a fourth-order nonlinear term in addition to the harmonic oscillator term in its Hamiltonian\n\n$$\n\nH = \\omega_{r}c^{\\dagger}c + K c^{\\dagger}c^{\\dagger}cc,\n\\label{Eq:Hfourwave}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $c$ denotes the resonator field operator and $K$ is the \u201cKerr-nonlinearity\". This process is a so-called four-wave mixing process, since it mixes four photons: one signal ($\\omega_s$), one idler ($\\omega_i$), and two pump photons ($\\omega_p$), obeying the energy conservation relation $\\omega_s + \\omega_i = 2\\omega_p$, see Fig. <ref>(b). Pioneered by Yurke[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], this was the first demonstration of microwave amplification using a Josephson parametric amplifier. When the signal and idler modes are at the same frequency, the amplification is said to be degenerate. This pumping scheme is the foundation for the Josephson Bifurcation Amplifier (JBA), developed by Siddiqi et al.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which has been used to perform single-shot qubit readout, by mapping the quantum states onto the high and low resonator field originating from the sharp bifurcation point of the amplifier[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn the other case, when the system is flux-pumped, the parametric process is driven by threading a magnetic flux $\\Phi_{\\mbox{\\tiny{ac}}}$ through a SQUID loop, thereby modulating the frequency of the resonator. This results in a three-wave mixing process, comprising three photons: one signal, one idler, and one pump photon, with $\\omega_s + \\omega_i = \\omega_p$, see Fig. <ref>(c). Therefore, we see that the pump frequency is about twice that of the signal $\\omega_p \\approx 2\\omega_s$ for $\\omega_s \\approx \\omega_i$. For degenerate, flux-pumped systems, the leading nonlinearity is a third-order term, yielding a Hamiltonian\n\n$$\n\nH = \\omega_{r}c^{\\dagger}c + K \\left( pc^{\\dagger}c^{\\dagger} + p^{\\dagger}cc\\right),\n\\label{Eq:Hthreewave}\n\n$$\n\nwhere the $p$ operator denotes the flux-pump mode. This approach to building parametric amplifiers was developed by Yamamoto et al.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], as well as by Sandberg et al.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe flux-pumping scheme has several practical advantages. First, the large detuning of the pump makes it easier to filter, isolating the readout signal as its passing into the digitizer downstream and preventing the saturation of following amplifier stages. Second, if the resonator is a quarter-wavelength resonator, it has no resonant mode at the pump frequency $\\omega_p$, reducing spurious population or saturation of the system as well as backaction on the qubits in the processor. Third, since the flux pump line is a separate on-chip microwave line, no additional directional coupler is needed.\n\nDue to its rich dynamics, flux-pumping has also proven a useful platform to study the quantum dynamics of Josephson parametric oscillators, both in the context of qubit readout[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the dynamical Casimir effect[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and to better understand their complex nonlinear dynamics[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn addition to the degenerate parametric interactions described above, parametric gain can be obtained between different resonant modes; either between different modes of the same resonator[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], or in-between different resonators[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], as with the Josephson parametric converter (JPC)[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In addition to the possibility of isolating and amplifying certain frequencies, the JPC can implement frequency conversion for which it has some other areas of applications compared with other types of parametric amplifiers.\n\nThe traveling wave parametric amplifier\n\nIn the previously described JPA, parametric amplification is realized using resonators that enhance the parametric interaction between the input signal and the Josephson junction nonlinearity. Essentially, the Q-enhancement of the resonator forces each photon to pass through the junction on average Q times before leaving the resonator, thereby enhancing the non-linear interaction. Albeit proven to be able to reach near the standard-quantum limit of noise for readout of a small number of qubits, the future direction of the community is heading towards amplifier technologies which are compatible with multiplexed readout of several qubits coupled to the same amplifier chain[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In this context, resonator-based parametric amplifiers suffer from two major drawbacks: First, the amplifier bandwidth is limited to the resonator linewidth, typically $\\approx 10-50\\,$MHz, practically limiting the number of multiplexed frequencies that can be amplified. Second, since the Josephson nonlinearity is realized by a small number of junctions, the saturation power is low due to the interplay of higher order nonlinearities, effectively taking the system outside its desired operation regime[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In practice, this limits how many readout resonators that can be simultanously read out.\n\nThese two bottlenecks can, to a degree, be overcome with microwave engineering. For instance, the linewidth can be made an order of magnitude wider by altering the impedance along the resonator. This is called a stepped-impedance transformer, where the impedance is ramped down from a matched 50$\\,\\Omega$ at the capacitor down to a small impedance at the SQUID[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] shorting the device to ground. Also the saturation power can be increased by distributing the nonlinearity across an array consisting of many identical junctions, reducing the Kerr-nonlinearity by a factor $1/N^2$ with $N$ representing the number of junctions in the array. This has been demonstrated by using a an array of SQUIDs in a resonator, rather than a single one[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nHowever, despite the above mentioned engineering efforts to improve the resonator-based JPAs, the most prominent approach to date is to get rid of the resonator altogether and, instead, construct a microwave analog to optical parametric amplifiers, where kilometers of weakly nonlinear fibers are used. Such device is called a traveling wave parametric amplifier (TWPA) and was developed to surmount the bandwidth and dynamic range limitations of the resonator-based JPAs.\n\nAlthough operated in similar way, the nonlinearity of TWPAs can be realized in different ways, such as the kinetic inductance of a superconducting film[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] or using an array of Josephson junctions[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], through which the four-wave mixing process is distributed across a nonlinear lumped element transmission line, see Fig. <ref>(a).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Simplified circuit representation of a Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA). The characteristic impedance for each unit cell is set by the in-line Josephson inductor, $L_J$ (orange) and the shunt capacitor, $C$ (blue). A resonant LC-circuit (red) is used to phase match the four-wave amplification process. (b) Schematic of how the signal gets amplified in each unit cell as it propagates through the device. (c) Gain vs. frequency for a JTWPA, with and without the resonant phase matching (RPM). (d) Dispersion relation of the TWPA, where the LC-resonators collectively open up a stopband at the resonant frequency. By applying the pump close to this frequency, the wave vector of the pump can be set to obtain a phase-matching. The optimal pump frequency depends on the pump power, as indicated in the inset. Image courtesy of Kevin O'Brien[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n\nThe Josephson TWPA consists of a few thousand identical unit cells, each comprising a shunt capacitor to ground and a nonlinear Josephson inductor, together yielding a characteristic impedance of $Z_0 = \\sqrt{L_J/C} \\approx 50\\,\\Omega$, see Fig. <ref>(a).\n\nThe fact that the nonlinearity is distributed allows for high saturation power, since each Josephson junction is accessed once. However, even though energy conservation is satisfied, the four-wave mixing process in the device, there is a problem with phase (or momentum) conservation. This is associated with the system nonlinearity as well as the large frequency detuning between signal and pump photons, yielding a difference in phase-velocity between the two, which in turn gives rise to a non-flat gain profile, as well as an overall reduction in gain[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nAgain, by taking inspiration from the dispersive engineering developed in quantum optics and photonics, where the refractive index can be periodically altered to engineer the momentum of a transferred signal, the solution to this phase-mismatch problem was introduced by O'Brien et al.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. By introducing resonators at periodic intervals of TWPA unit cells, the pump tone can be given a \u201cmomentum kick\", effectively slowing it down and phase-matching the device by means of its wave vector. This technique is called resonant-phase matching (RPM), see Fig. <ref>(d), and requires that the pump frequency is set on the left side of the dispersion feature (where the wave vector diverges), defined by the resonant frequency of the phase-matching resonators. Note, finally, that broadband parametric amplification with high dynamic range has been demonstrated in other Josephson-based circuits, e.g. the superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element (SNAIL) parametric amplifier (SPA)[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n## Summary and outlook\nIn this review, we have discussed the phenomenal progress over the last decade in the engineering of superconducting devices, the development of high-fidelity gate-operations, and quantum non-demolition measurements with high signal-to-noise ratio. Putting these advances together, we hope that it is clear that the planar superconducting qubit modality is a promising platform for realizing near-term medium scale quantum processors. While we have focused on highlighting the advances made within the fields of realizing, controlling and reading out planar superconducting qubits specifically used for quantum information processing, there has of course also been tremendous activity in the surrounding fields. In this final section, we briefly mention a few of those fields, and invite the reader to look into the references, for further details.\n\nQuantum annealing: Superconducting qubits also form the basis for certain quantum annealing platforms[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Quantum annealing operates by finding the ground state of a given Hamiltonian (typically a classical Ising Hamiltonian), and this state will correspond to the solution of an optimization problem. By utilizing a flux-qubit type design (see Sec.<ref>, the company D-Wave have demonstrated quantum annealing processors[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] which have now reached beyond 2000 qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The benchmarking of quantum annealers and attempts to demonstrate a quantum speedup for a general class of problems is a highly active research field, and we refer the reader, for example, to recent papers Refs. Denchev2016,Albash2018,King2019 and references therein.\n\nCavity based QIP: A parallel effort to the planar superconducting qubits discussed in this review is the development of 3D cavity-based superconducting qubits. In these systems, quantum information is encoded in superpositions of coherent photonic modes of the cavity[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The cat states can be highly coherent due to the inherently high quality factors associated with 3D cavities[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This approach has a fairly small hardware overhead to encode a logical qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and lends itself to certain implementations of asymmetric error-correcting codes due to the fact that errors due to single-photon loss in the cavity is a tractable observable to decode. Using this architecture, several important advances were recently demonstrated including extending the lifetime of an error-corrected qubit beyond its constituent parts[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], randomized benchmarking of logical operations[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], a  gate between two logical qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] as well as Ramsey interference of an encoded quantum error corrected qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nCryogenics and software development: We briefly mentioned the electrical engineering, software development, and cryogenic considerations associated with the control wiring and on-chip layout of medium-scale quantum processors. While dilution refrigerators are now readily available, off-the-shelf commercial products, the details of how to optimally do signal-routing and rapid data processing in a scalable fashion, is also a field in rapid development. However, with the recent demonstrations of enabling technologies such as 3D integration, packages for multi-layered devices and superconducting interconnects[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], some of the immediate concerns for how to scale the number of qubits in the superconducting modality, have been addressed. On the control software side, there currently exist multiple commercial and free software packages for interfacing with quantum hardware, such as [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the related [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, many laboratories use software platforms developed in-house, often due to the concurrent development of custom-built, highly specialized electronics and FPGA circuits (many of these developments are not always published, but readers may consult Refs. Asaad2016,LiuPhD2016,Ryan2017 for three examples). There is currently also a large ongoing development of quantum circuit simulation and compiling software packages. Packages such as [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ],  (with [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]), [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the Microsoft Quantum Development kit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] provide higher-level programming languages to compile and/or optimize quantum algorithms. For a recent review and comparison of these different software suites, we refer to Ref.LaRose2019 and Ref.Chong2017 for a general review on advances in designing quantum software. Since the connectivity and gate set of quantum processors can differ, details of the gate compilation implementation is an important non-trivial problem for larger-scale processors. We note that some of these software packages already interface directly with quantum processors that are available online, supplied, for example, via Rigetti Computing or the IBM Quantum Experience.\n\nQuantum error correction: While the qubit lifetimes and gate fidelity have improved dramatically in the last decades, there remains a need for error correction to reach large-scale processors. While certain strategies exist to extend the computational reach of current state-of-the-art physical qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], for truly large-scale algorithms addressing practical problems, the quantum data will have to be embedded in an error-correcting scheme. As briefly mentioned in Sections <ref> and <ref>, certain components of the surface code quantum error correcting scheme have already been demonstrated in superconducting qubits (see e.g. Refs.Kelly2015,Riste2015,Takita2016). However, the demonstration of a logical qubit with greater lifetime than the underlying physical qubits, remains an outstanding challenge. While the surface code is a promising quantum error correcting code due to its relatively lenient fault tolerance threshold, it cannot implement a universal gate set in a fault-tolerant manner. This means that the error-corrected gates in the surface code need to be supplemented, for example, with a  gate, to become universal. Such gates can be implemented by a technique known as magic state distillation[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The process of gate-teleportation, a pre-cursor to magic state distillation, has already been demonstrated using FPGA-based classical feedback with planar superconducting qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], but showing distillation and injection into a surface code logical state remains an open challenge. The development of new quantum codes is also a field in rapid development, and the reader may consult a recent review for more details e.g. Ref.Campbell2017. Another important step towards large-scale quantum processor architecture is that of remote entanglement, enabling quantum information to be distributed across different nodes of a quantum processing network[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nQuantum computational supremacy: Finally, we mention one of the grand challenges for superconducting qubits in the coming years: the demonstration of quantum computational supremacy[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The basic idea is to demonstrate a calculation, using qubits and algorithmic gates, which is outside the scope of classical computers (assuming some plausible computational complexity conjectures). For a recent review article, the reader is referred to Ref.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. A first step towards an approach to demonstrating quantum supremacy was recently reported, using 9 tunable transmons[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. It is expected that with somewhere between 50-100 qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], an extension of the protocol from Refs.Neill2018,Boixo2018, will allow researchers to sample from a classically intractable distribution, and thereby demonstrate quantum computational supremacy. The success of this program would constitute a phenomenal result for all of quantum computing.\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge Mollie Kimchi-Schwartz, Jochen Braum\u00fcller, Niels-Jakob S\u00f8e Loft, and David DiVincenzo for careful reading of the manuscript and Youngkyu Sung for use of his time-dependent qubit drive simulation suite and useful feedback from the entire Engineering Quantum Systems group at MIT.

In this paper, we introduce techniques originally developed for wireless communication applications to calibrate upconversion and downconversion mixers.\nA Kalman filter together with a controllable carrier frequency offset calibrates both mixers without removing them from the embedding measurement infrastructure.\nThese techniques can be embedded into room temperature control electronics and they will find widespread use as circuit QED devices continue to grow in size and complexity.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe superconducting qubit processors are continuously growing in scale and complexity, placing increasing demands on the performance of room temperature electronics.\nAn essential component is the IQ mixer.\nIn circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) <cit.>, IQ mixers are used to upconvert control signals from classical electronics and downconvert signals emitted from the quantum circuit.\nIn wireless radiofrequency (RF) and microwave systems, IQ mixers are particularly useful for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) schemes, commonly used for cost-efficient and high-data-rate systems <cit.>.\nApplications include point-to-point communication <cit.> and various radar technologies <cit.>.\n\nIQ mixers are analog components, which by their very nature require calibration.\nThe error we calibrate for in this paper is the so-called mixer imbalance.\nFor upconversion, the imbalance manifests as the generation of a spurious signal called the image, accompanying every desired signal.\nFor downconversion imbalance prevents unambiguous separation of the signal and image sidebands in a heterodyne detection scheme (or equivalently, a low-IF receiver setup).\nIn either case, calibration of the IQ mixer allows for conversion to a single sideband of the carrier frequency and suppression of its image, thus leading to more efficient use of frequency space.\nThis efficiency becomes critical, for example, when implementing high-fidelity qubit gates [A. Bengtsson, \"Quantum information processing with tunable and low-loss superconducting circuits\", 2020] for quantum computing and applications where multiple qubits are controlled and measured on the same signal line.\nSuch frequency-domain multiplexing of signals is also highly desirable in modern communication technology [M. Windisch, \"Estimation and Compensation of I/Q Imbalance\nin Broadband Communications Receivers\", 2007].\n\nTechnological progress in direct synthesis and sampling of RF signals is rapidly progressing <cit.>, but until this technology covers the entire frequency band used in circuit QED, IQ mixers are an unfortunate necessity.\nHowever we can use various digital techniques to compensate for their imperfections.\nThis is occasionally referred to as the dirty RF paradigm, where imperfect, or dirty, RF devices are improved through digital means <cit.>.\nIn this paper, we combine ideas originally developed for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) applications to calibrate mixers in a circuit-QED setting.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nThe image leakage ratio (ILR) of an upconversion mixer as it changes over time, due to drifts in the mixer parameters. Similar phenomena will also occur at the downconversion stage. In either case, regular re-calibration is necessary for optimal performance.\n\nThe ideal calibration method should avoid any additional external equipment such as RF sources and spectrum analyzers, and it should calibrate both mixers simultaneously.\nIn addition it should also permit frequent re-calibration of the mixers to compensate for drift, which can be substantial. For example, in Fig. (Figure fig: drift_example) we plot the image leakage ratio (ILR), defined as the ratio of power at the image band to the power at the signal band, vs. time.\nInitially the image is suppressed, but gradually increases over time by 20dB.\nWe attribute this drift to changes in the mixer's temperature.\nThis strongly suggests that regular re-calibration of mixers is necessary in order to maintain optimal performance of superconducting qubit processors.\nFor frequent re-calibration to be feasible, the both mixers must be calibrated in situ.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel technique that achieves these goals.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: in section II we introduce the simplified IQ mixer model for upconversion and downconversion and a model for mixer imbalance. In section III we discuss the digital algorithms for calibration. In section IV we apply these techniques to a typical experimental circuit-QED setup with low-intermediate frequency (IF) transmission and receiver stage. In addition, we introduce our method to calibrate both upconversion and downconversion mixers simultaneously. In the final section V, we conclude with a brief summary.\n\n## Modelling the IQ Mixer\nAn ideal IQ mixer should behave as a multiplier of signals in the time domain.\nOne of the signals is often a pure tone at high frequency, called a carrier wave, and the mixer is used to convert or translate the frequency components of the other tone, either up or down in frequency.\nStarting with upconversion, mixing in the time domain can be described as [J. Kim, H. Jo, K. Lee, D. Lee, D. Choi, S. Kim, \"A Low-Complexity I/Q Imbalance Calibration Method for Quadrature Modulator\", 2019] [M. Windisch, G. Fettweis, \"Adaptive I/Q imbalance compensation in low-IF transmitter architectures\", 2004]\n\n$$\n\nr(t) = \\Re\\{z(t)e^{j \\Omega t}\\},\n\\label{ideal_upconversion_mixer_model}\n\n$$\nwhere $r(t)$ is the signal at the RF output port, $\\Omega$ is the frequency of the carrier applied to the local-oscillator (LO) input port and $z(t) = z_I(t) + j z_Q(t)$ denotes the signals applied to the I and Q input ports (see Fig. (Figure fig: upconversion circuit) (a) ).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\na) A schematic upconversion circuit with phase $\\phi$ and amplitude $G$ imbalances indicated in red font.\nb) A schematic downconversion circuit with imbalances indicated in red font.\n\nIn the frequency domain this description is well illustrated in matrix form\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc[\\omega] \\\\\nc^*[-\\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nz[\\Omega + \\omega] \\\\\nz^*[\\Omega - \\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\label{ideal_upconversion_FT}\n\n$$\nwhere $r[\\omega] = c[\\omega] + c^*[-\\omega]$.\nUpconversion mixing will therefore create two sidebands at $\\Omega \\pm \\omega$.\nIn this paper, we refer to the upper sideband $\\Omega + \\omega$ as the signal and the lower sideband $\\Omega - \\omega$ as the image.\n\nThe image is generally undesirable as it crowds the limited bandwidth, otherwise needed for multiplexing, with unwanted signals.\nThis frequency crowding is particularly detrimental to applications in wireless local-area networks (WLAN) <cit.>, as well to the fidelity of frequency-multiplexed control and readout of superconducting qubits<cit.>.\nThe image can be cancelled by injecting the appropriate signals into the I and Q ports of the IQ mixer, such that $z_I(t) + j z_Q(t) = x(t)e^{j\\omega t}$, where $x(t)$ is real.\n\nHowever, this cancellation is negatively affected by imperfections in the mixer.\nWe will characterize these imperfections as amplitude $G_{\\text{up}}$ and phase $\\phi_{\\text{up}}$ imbalance, stemming from an asymmetry in the I and Q branches of the mixer.\nThe imbalance modifies Eq. (<ref>) according to\n$$\n\nr(t) = \\Re\\{z(t)\\left[\\cos \\left(\\Omega t \\right) + j G_{\\text{up}} \\sin \\left(\\Omega t + \\phi_{\\text{up}}\\right)\\right]\\},\n\\label{nonideal_upconversion_mixer_model}\n\n$$\nthus Eq. (<ref>) becomes\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc[\\omega] \\\\\nc^*[-\\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\\frac{1}{4}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n{J^*_{\\text{up}}} & {K_{\\text{up}}} \\\\\n{K^*_{\\text{up}}} & {J_{\\text{up}}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nz[\\Omega + \\omega] \\\\\nz^*[\\Omega - \\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\label{nonideal_upconversion_FT}\n\n$$\nwhere we define the complex quantities $J_{\\text{up}} = 1 + G_{\\text{up}} e^{-j\\phi_{\\text{up}}}$ and $K_{\\text{up}} = 1 - G_{\\text{up}} e^{j\\phi_{\\text{up}}}$.\nWe regain the perfect mixer relations by setting $G_{\\text{up}} = 1$ and $\\phi_{\\text{up}} = 0$.\nDue to the presence of the off-diagonal terms, injecting $z(t) = x(t)e^{j\\omega t}$ will no longer cancel the image completely.\nHowever, if the phase and amplitude imbalances were known (or equivalently, $J_{\\text{up}}$ and $K_{\\text{up}}$), an appropriate $z(t)$ could be generated to cancel the image.\n\nThe ideal behavior of a downconversion mixer is very similar to upconversion. In the time domain the output at the I and Q ports are given by <cit.>\n$$\n\nz(t)= z_I(t) + j z_Q(t) = \\text{LPF}\\{r(t)e^{-j \\Omega t}\\},\n\\label{ideal_downconversion_mixer_model}\n\n$$\nwhere LPF denotes a low-pass filter(see Fig. (Figure fig: upconversion circuit) (b)).\nThe output at the I and Q ports contain both signal and image, which we write as $z(t) = Z_\\text{sig}(t) + Z_\\text{img}(t)$.\nIn the frequency domain we have\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\text{sig}[\\omega] \\\\\nZ_\\text{img}^*[-\\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_\\text{sig}[\\omega + \\Omega] \\\\\nY_\\text{img}^*[-\\omega + \\Omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\label{ideal_downconversion_FT}\n\n$$\nwhere $Y_\\text{sig}[\\omega + \\Omega]$ and $Y_\\text{img}[\\omega + \\Omega]$ is the signal and image respectively entering the RF input port.\n\nAmplitude and phase imbalance are introduced in an analogous manner. The time domain expression is modified according to\n$$\n\nz(t) = \\text{LPF}\\{r(t)\\left[\\cos \\left(\\Omega t \\right) - j G_{\\text{down}} \\sin \\left(\\Omega t + \\phi_{\\text{down}}\\right)\\right]\\},\n\\label{nonideal_downconversion_mixer_model}\n\n$$\nand the analogous frequency-domain expression is <cit.>\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\text{sig}[\\omega] \\\\\nZ_\\text{img}^*[-\\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\\frac{1}{4}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nJ_{\\text{down}} & K_{\\text{down}} \\\\\n{K^*_{\\text{down}}} & {J^*_{\\text{down}}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_\\text{sig}[\\omega + \\Omega] \\\\\nY_\\text{img}^*[-\\omega + \\Omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\label{nonideal_downconversion_FT}\n\n$$\nThe definitions for $J_{\\text{down}}$ and $K_{\\text{down}}$ are analogous to the upconversion case.\nSince the matrix is no longer diagonal, imbalance will cause downconversion from both signal and image sidebands of the carrier.\n\nFurther simplification is made by decomposing the matrix in Eq. (<ref>) into <cit.>\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\text{sig}[\\omega] \\\\\nZ_\\text{img}^*[-\\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\frac{1}{2}\n\\underbrace{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k_q \\\\\nk_q^* & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}_\\text{leakage matrix}\n\\underbrace{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nJ_{\\text{down}} & 0 \\\\\n0 & J^*_{\\text{down}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}_\\text{scaling matrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_\\text{sig}[\\omega + \\Omega] \\\\\nY_\\text{img}^*[-\\omega + \\Omega]\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\label{nonideal_downconversion_double_matrix}\n\n$$\nwhere $k_q$ is the ratio\n$$\n\nk_q =  \\frac{K_{\\text{down}}}{J^*_{\\text{down}}} = \\frac{1-G_{\\text{down}}e^{j\\phi_{\\text{down}}}}{1+G_{\\text{down}} e^{j \\phi_{\\text{down}}}}.\n\n$$\n\n## Correcting the IQ Mixer\nIn this section we take a look at how to calibrate the IQ mixers at both the upconversion and downconversion stage. We start by discussing the  upconversion mixer calibration in subsection <ref> and then proceed to discuss the downconversion calibration in subsection <ref>.\n\n### Upconversion stage\nFor upconversion, the signals $z_I$ and $z_Q$ are typically generated with a digital source, allowing for fine tuning of their amplitude and phase so as to cancel the image. We refer to this process as digital pre-distortion. The quality of the cancellation is measured by the image leakage ratio (ILR) defined as,\n$$\n\n\\text{ILR} = \\frac{\\text{power at image frequency}}{\\text{power at signal frequency}}.\n\\label{eqn: ILR def}\n\n$$\n\nTo correct for this drift one can introduce feedback to adjust the amplitude and phase of the digital pre-distortion signals at the I and Q ports, so as to continuously minimize the ILR.\nThe upconversion circuit schematic in Fig. (Figure fig: upconversion circuit) (a) is extended to include the digital source, depicted in Fig. (Figure fig: upconversion_model).\nThe amplitude and phase imbalances of the upconversion mixer are replaced by the alternative imbalance parameters $\\alpha = G_{\\text{up}} \\cos \\phi_{\\text{up}}$ and $\\beta = G_{\\text{up}} \\sin \\phi_{\\text{up}}$.\nIn the digital pre-distortion stage these parameters are denoted as $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$.\nThe ILR can then be expressed as <cit.>\n$$\n\n\\text{ILR}(\\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\beta}) = \\frac{(\\alpha - \\hat{\\alpha})^2 + (\\beta - \\hat{\\beta})^2}{(\\alpha + \\hat{\\alpha})^2+ (\\beta - \\hat{\\beta})^2}, \\label{eqn: ILR}\n\n$$\nrevealing that when $\\hat{\\alpha} = \\alpha$ and $\\hat{\\beta} = \\beta$ we have optimal image suppression.\nIn the absence of any digital pre-distortion, i.e. $\\hat{\\alpha} = 1$ and $\\hat{\\beta} = 0$, the ILR then depends on the intrinsic imbalances of the mixer, which vanishes for the perfectly balanced mixer $\\alpha = 1$ and $\\beta = 0$.\n\nWe can use semi-analytical methods <cit.> or use various minimization techniques such as the Nelder-Mead method <cit.> to identify parameters $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$.\nIn this work we apply an iterative algorithm from Ref. <cit.>.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic for the upconversion circuit. The amplitude and phase imbalances $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are compensated by digitally distorting the IF input as indicated in the figure. See Ref. <cit.> for details.\n\nThe cost function to minimize is the quantity:\n$$\n\n\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_i,\\hat{\\beta}_j) = 4 \\hat{\\alpha}_i^2 \\text{ILR}_{i, j} \\label{eqn: C}\n\n$$\nwhere the subscripts $i$ and $j$ track the iteration steps and $\\text{ILR}_{i,j}$ is the measured image leakage ratio with the applied pre-distortion parameters $\\hat{\\alpha}_i$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_j$.\n\nThe updated distortion parameter $\\hat{\\alpha}_i$ is calculated according to\n$$\n\n\\hat{\\alpha}_i &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\hat{\\alpha}_{i - 2} + \\hat{\\alpha}_{i - 1} - \\frac{ \\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_{i-2},\\hat{\\beta}_{i-2}) - \\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_{i-1},\\hat{\\beta}_{i-2}) }{\\hat{\\alpha}_{i - 2} - \\hat{\\alpha}_{i - 1}} \\right), \\label{eqn: update_alpha_rule}\n\n$$\nwhile the updated $\\hat{\\beta}_i$ is calculated according to\n$$\n\n\\hat{\\beta}_i &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{i - 2} + \\hat{\\beta}_{i - 1} - \\frac{ \\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_{i-1},\\hat{\\beta}_{i-2}) - \\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_{i-1},\\hat{\\beta}_{i-2}) }{\\hat{\\beta}_{i - 2} - \\hat{\\beta}_{i - 1}} \\right). \\label{eqn: update_beta_rule}\n\n$$\n\nWe initialize the algorithm by choosing $\\hat{\\alpha}_0, \\hat{\\alpha}_1 \\approx 1$, $\\hat{\\beta}_0 , \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\approx 0$, and proceed as follows:\n\n* Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_0$, measure $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_0,\\hat{\\beta}_0)$.\n\n* Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_0$, measure $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_1,\\hat{\\beta}_0)$.\n\n* Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, measure $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_1,\\hat{\\beta}_1)$. Compute $\\hat{\\alpha}_2$.\n\n* Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_2$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, measure $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_2,\\hat{\\beta}_1)$. Compute $\\hat{\\beta}_2$.\n\n* Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_2$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_2$, measure $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_2,\\hat{\\beta}_2)$. Compute $\\hat{\\alpha}_3$.\n\n* Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_3$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_2$, measure $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_3,\\hat{\\beta}_2)$. Compute $\\hat{\\beta}_3$.\n\n\u22ee\n\nThe iteration is continued until a desired threshold on the $\\text{ILR}_{i, j}$ is satisfied.\n\n### Downconversion stage\nGiven an observed signal $Z_\\text{sig}[\\omega]$ and idler $Z^*_\\text{img}[-\\omega]$ after downconversion, we want to reconstruct the actual signal $Y_\\text{sig}[\\omega + \\Omega]$ and idler $Y^*_\\text{img}[-\\omega + \\Omega]$ before entering the imbalanced IQ mixer.\nThis is possible according to Eq. (<ref>), if we manage to determine $k_q$ and $J_{\\text{down}}$.\nFor simplicity, the scaling matrix is henceforth neglected since it does not contribute to the leakage between sidebands.\nThis leaves us with only one complex parameter $k_q$.\n\nBefore proceeding, we simplify our notation by introducing $Y_m = Y_\\text{sig}[\\omega + \\Omega]$ and $Y^*_{-m} = Y^*_\\text{img}[-\\omega + \\Omega]$.\nThe subscript $-m$ denotes the images while $m$ denotes signals.\nAnalogous notation will also be used for $Z_\\text{sig}[\\omega]$ and $Z^*_\\text{img}[-\\omega]$.\nThe current best estimate of $k_q$ is denoted $\\hat{k}_q$.\nWith $\\hat{k}_q$ we reconstruct the undistorted signal and image according to\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_m \\\\\nY^*_{-m}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -\\hat{k}_q \\\\\n-\\hat{k}^*_q & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_m \\\\\nZ^*_{-m}\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\label{mixing_model}\n\n$$\nneglecting the complex scaling factor.\n\nWe use a method developed by Windisch and Fettweis <cit.> to estimate $\\hat{k}_q$. If we assume $\\langle Y_m Y_{-m} \\rangle = 0$, it is possible to estimate the mixer imbalance by first calculating:\n$$\n\n\\hat{k}_p &=  \\frac{\\left\\langle{Z_m Z_{-m}}\\right\\rangle}{\\left\\langle\\left|Z_m + Z_{-m}^* \\right|^2 \\right\\rangle}, \\label{downconversion_calibration_eq1}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\langle ... \\rangle$ indicates an average.\nThen $\\hat{k}_q$ is related to $\\hat{k}_p$ according to:\n$$\n\n\\hat{k}_q &= \\frac{1 - a - j b}{1+a+j b},\\\\\nb &= -2 \\Im \\left[ \\hat{k}_p \\right], \\\\\na &= \\sqrt{1-b^2-4 \\Re\\left\\{ \\hat{k}_p \\right\\}},\n\\label{downconversion_calibration_eq5}\n\n$$\nConsequentially, the amplitude and phase imbalances are $G_{\\text{down}} = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and $\\phi_{\\text{down}} = \\arctan(b/a)$ respectively.\nEquations (<ref>) - (<ref>) are the core of the downconversion calibration procedure.\nBecause the downconversion mixer also drifts in time (see Fig. (Figure fig: drift_example)), feedback is also needed to update $\\hat{k}_q$.  The procedure is therefore enhanced with a Kalman filter.\n\nKalman filters are used to determine state variables/parameters (stationary or dynamical) from noisy observations. The filter is employed in such diverse applications as navigation <cit.> and multifrequency atomic force-microscopy <cit.>.\nOther applications include cooling of nanoparticles through feedback <cit.>, and state estimation in atomic magnetometry <cit.> and optomechanics <cit.>.\nFor a detailed theoretical discussion, we refer the interested reader to Ref. <cit.>.\nTo set up a discrete-time Kalman filter, we need a process equation and a measurement equation <cit.>.\n\nThe process equation relates the sought after state variables at two different points in time.\nIn this case, the state variable is $k_q$ and our process equation is\n$$\n\nk_q(i+1) &= k_q(i) + v_p(i). \\label{process_noise}\n\n$$\nThe argument $i$ denotes ordered, finite intervals of time that we henceforth refer to as time frames.\nThe IQ mixer state variable $k_q(i)$ is assumed to evolve in time according to equation (<ref>),  in which the process noise $v_p(i)$ is Gaussian with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2_p (i)$.\nWe attribute the origin of this noise term to various fluctuations in the analog electronics and temperature.\n\nThe measurement equation describes how our estimated value of the state variable, which is determined from noisy measurement data, is related to the actual or true value of the state variable\n$$\n\n\\hat{k}_q(i) &= k_q(i) + v_m(i). \\label{measaurement_noise}\n\n$$\nThe measurement noise $v_m(i)$ is Gaussian with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2_m (i)$.\n\nThe Kalman filter provides the estimated $\\hat{k}_q$ at different time frames.\nThe filtered estimate $\\hat{k}_q(i|\\mathfrak{H}_{i})$, with variance $\\sigma_m^2(i)$, is the best estimate (in the least-square sense) of the state $k_q$ at the current time frame $i$, based on a history of observations $\\mathfrak{H}_{i}$ up to and including frame $i$.\nThe predicted estimate $\\hat{k}_q(i+1|\\mathfrak{H}_{i})$, with variance $\\sigma^2_m(i+1, i)$, is the best estimate for the future frame $i+1$ based on the past history of observations.\n\nThe Kalman filter is initialized at $i=0$ such that $\\hat{k}_q(1|\\mathfrak{H}_{0}) = 0$ and its variance $\\sigma^2_m(1,0) = \\infty$.\nOther values of $\\hat{k}_q(1|\\mathfrak{H}_{0})$ with smaller $\\sigma^2_m(1,0)$ are possible (for example, if we have values from a previous calibration run).\nFor $i \\geqslant 1$ we do the following <cit.>:\n\n* Record $n=1,2, ..., N$ samples of $Z^n_k(i)$, $Z^n_{-k}(i)$ and reconstruct $Y^n_k(i)$, $Y^n_{-k}(i)$ using the predicted $\\hat{k}_q(i|\\mathfrak{H}_{i-1})$ according to Eq. (<ref>). Thereafter, estimate the variances, $\\sigma^2_k(i)$ and $\\sigma^2_{-k}(i)$ from the $Y^n_k(i)$ and $Y^n_{-k}(i)$ data.\n\n* Simultaneously, use $Z^n_k(i)$, $Z^n_{-k}(i)$ to compute $\\hat{k}_q(i)$ according to Eq. (<ref>). Here $\\hat{k}_q(i)$ is the current time frame's noisy estimate. The error variance of this quantity is approximately\n$$\n\n\\sigma_{q}^2(i) &\\approx \\left[N \\left(1 + \\frac{\\sigma^2_{k}}{\\sigma^2_{-k}} \\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{\\sigma^2_{-k}}{\\sigma^2_{k}} \\right) \\right]^{-1}.\n\n$$\n\n* Update the variance of the filtered estimate as\n$$\n\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma_m^2(i)} &= \\frac{1}{\\sigma_m ^2(i, i-1)}+ \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{q}^2(i)}.\n\n$$\n\n* Update the predicted estimate\n$$\n\n\\hat{k}_q(i+1|\\mathfrak{H}_{i}) &= \\sigma_m^2(i) \\left( \\frac{\\hat{k}_q(i|\\mathfrak{H}_{i-1})}{\\sigma_m ^2(i, i-1)} + \\frac{\\hat{k}_q(i)}{\\sigma_{q}^2(i)} \\right).\n\n$$\n\n* Compute the variance of the predicted estimate as\n$$\n\n\\sigma_m^2(i+1, i) &= \\sigma_m^2(i) + \\sigma_p^2(i).\n\n$$\n\n* Finally, update the filtered estimate\n$$\n\n\\hat{k}_q(i|\\mathfrak{H}_{i}) &= \\hat{k}_q(i+1|\\mathfrak{H}_{i}).\n\n$$\n\nNotice that the drift $\\sigma_p^2(i)$ is not updated.\nThis needs to be specified from the start and its magnitude (compared to $\\sigma_m^2(i)$) will determine how little weight is given to past in contrast to present observations.\n\nWe test the filter on a system consisting only of a downconversion mixer driven by a pure RF tone corresponding to the signal.\nThe Kalman filter is initialized with the erroneous assumption that the mixer is ideal with near-zero variance.\nThe incoming RF signal is integrated for 4 ms and the Kalman filter algorithm is used to acquire an estimate of the filtered parameter $\\hat{k}_q(i|\\mathfrak{H}_i)$.\nThe image and signal sidebands are reconstructed according to Eq. (<ref>), whose quality can be assessed by plotting the ILR at each iteration step, see Fig. (Figure fig: pure USB tone calibration).\nThere is a steady decrease in the ILR until the noise floor is reached, indicating a successful calibration of the downconversion mixer.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nReconstructed ILR through the downconversion mixer using a Kalman filter as a function of time frames.\nWe initialize the algorithm by assuming a perfect mixer $G_{\\text{down}} = 1$ and $\\phi_{\\text{down}} = 0$, with near-zero variance.\nAfter 100 iterations, the ILR becomes limited by the noise floor and we extract the filtered parameters $G_{\\text{down}} = 0.961$ and $\\phi_{\\text{down}} = 0.96^\\circ$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic setup for mixer calibration. The output RF signal is split with a Wilkinson power divider. One branch leads to a fully equipped cryogenic low-noise microwave reflection setup inside a dilution refrigerator.\nThe other branch is monitored by a spectrum analyzer, to prove our procedure is working as intended.\n\n## Complete calibration of conversion chain\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nFlow chart graphically summarises the calibration loop.\nThe upconversion calibration alternately updates $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ using an estimated value of $\\tilde{C}(n, m)$ obtained from the downconversion stage.\nA Kalman filter is used to calibrate the downconversion stage to ensure a correct value of $\\tilde{C}(n, m)$ is obtained.\n\nThe upconversion and downconversion mixers are individually straightforward to calibrate, as previously shown. However, many experimental setups consists of both upconversion and downconversion stages, each with imbalances that needs to be corrected.\nCalibrating both mixers in situ introduces another problem not addressed so far: how does one go about distinguishing the error of one mixer from another?\nWe introduce and demonstrate two new approaches that resolves this issue and permits automated calibration of the entire frequency conversion chain.\n\nThese ideas are tested on a fairly typical experimental setup for research in circuit QED, shown in Fig. (Figure fig:set_up).\nThe digital source used to generate the I and Q signals is the Vivace platform from Intermodulation Products AB <cit.>.\nThis same instrument also coherently demodulates the downconverted signals.\nWith multiple output and input ports to drive and measure at the I and Q ports of both up- and downconversion mixers, and with its ability to coherently modulate and demodulate up to 32 frequencies simultaneously, Vivace greatly simplifies our measurement setup.\nThe output is upconverted with a IQ0318M mixer from Marki Microwave and split with a power divider into two branches.\nOne branch is connected to a spectrum analyzer.\nThe spectrum analyzer is not required and its sole purpose is to act as an independent observer of the calibration procedure.\nMeanwhile, the other branch is connected to a dilution refrigerator, wired with low-noise amplifiers, attenuators, circulators and isolators.\nThe signal is finally downconverted with another IQ0318M mixer, before being digitally demodulated from intermediate frequency (IF) to baseband with Vivace.\n\nThe ILR produced by the imbalanced upconversion mixer can be measured by both the spectrum analyzer and the imbalanced downconversion stage.\nIf the downconversion calibration works ideally, the ILR measured at the downconversion stage (henceforth referred to as the downconversion ILR) will be identical to the ILR measured with the spectrum analyzer (referred to as the upconversion ILR).\n\nThe calibration loop is graphically summarized in Fig. (Figure fig:flow_chart).\nIt can be divided into two sections, corresponding to the up- and downconversion stages.\nThe loop principally follows the algorithm in section <ref>.\nThe new addition is the Kalman filter (see section <ref>) at the downconversion stage.\nThe Kalman filter is run for several iterations (in our case, the number of iterations ranged from 20-100) to calibrate the downconversion mixer, which is necessary to acquire an accurate value for $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_i,\\hat{\\beta}_j)$ (see Eq. (<ref>)).\nThis in turn suggests the next $\\hat{\\alpha}_i$ or $\\hat{\\beta}_i$ through Eq. (<ref>) and (<ref>).\nHowever, the imbalanced upconversion-mixer will generate correlated signals and images, violating the assumption $\\langle Y_m Y_{-m} \\rangle = 0$ necessary for downconversion-mixer calibration.\n\nWe present two methods to circumvent this problem.\nThe first method involves calibrating with white noise at the signal and image bands.\nWhile calibrating the downconversion mixer, we turn off the upconversion-mixer output, and sample noise instead.\nFor the sake of clarity, we explicitly list the first few steps of the procedure. First initialize by choosing $\\hat{\\alpha}_1$ and $\\hat{\\alpha}_2$ close to 1, $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ close to 0, then:\n\n* Turn off the RF upconversion-mixer output (by turning off the IF signal).\n\n* Run the Kalman filter (according to section <ref>) by sampling incoming noise in the signal and image bands. This results in a best $\\hat{k}_{q}$.\n\n* Turn on the RF upconversion-mixer output. Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$. Measure both signal and image sidebands at the downconversion stage.\n\n* Proceed to reconstruct the undistorted sidebands according to Eq. (<ref>), using the recently acquired $\\hat{k}_{q}$. The ratio of powers is the downconversion ILR. Use it to calculate the quantity $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_1,\\hat{\\beta}_1)$, as defined in Eq. (<ref>).\n\n* Turn off the RF upconversion-mixer output.\n\n* Run the Kalman filter (according to section <ref>) by sampling incoming noise in the signal and image bands. This results in a new best $\\hat{k}_{q}$.\n\n* Turn on the RF upconversion-mixer output. Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_2$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$. Measure both signal and image sidebands at the downconversion stage.\n\n* Proceed to reconstruct the undistorted sidebands according to equation (<ref>), using the recently updated $\\hat{k}_{q}$. The ratio of powers is the downconversion ILR. Use it to calculate the quantity $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_2,\\hat{\\beta}_1)$.\n\n\u22ee\n\nNotice how we follow the algorithm given in section <ref>, with the addition of turning off the upconversion mixer output and calibrating the downconversion mixer before every new estimate of $\\tilde{C}(n, m)$. The initialization of the Kalman filter would be either a best guess or using the best estimate values from the previous Kalman filter loop.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDownconverting with an LO detuned by $\\delta f$, referred to as a carrier frequency offset (CFO), spectrally separates the two sidebands at downconversion by $2\\delta f$. As a consequence, the downconversion stage effectively measures two signal-image pairs. If we call the red and blue arrows signals, then their respective images contain only noise. Each signal-image pair is therefore uncorrelated and the downconversion calibration is valid.\n\nThe second method to separate the calibration of upconversion and downconversion relies on two different carrier tones, detuned by a carrier frequency offset (CFO).\nReferring to Fig. (Figure fig:CFO_schematic), a CFO will prevent the incoming signal (blue) and image (red) sidebands from being superimposed upon downconversion.\nThus from the perspective of the downconversion stage, the blue and red arrows are two incoming signals, with their respective image bands containing only noise.\nThe Kalman filter is run for each pair separately (essentially two filters running in parallel) and generates two values $\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q$ and $\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q$.\nThe red and blue signals are distorted by the imbalances in the downconversion mixer, and are corrected by inserting $\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q$ and $\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q$ into Eq. (<ref>)\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_\\text{red} \\\\\nY^*_{-, \\text{red}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n&=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -\\hat{k}_{q, \\text{red}} \\\\\n-\\hat{k}^*_{q, \\text{red}} & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\text{red} \\\\\nZ^*_{-, \\text{red}}\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\\\\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_\\text{blue} \\\\\nY^*_{-, \\text{blue}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n&=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -\\hat{k}_{q, \\text{blue}} \\\\\n-\\hat{k}^*_{q, \\text{blue}} & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\text{blue} \\\\\nZ^*_{-, \\text{blue}}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\n$$\nThe ILR used to calibrate the upconversion mixer is then calculated as $\\text{ILR} = |Y_\\text{red}|/|Y_\\text{blue}|$.\nUsing a CFO, a proper estimation of the ILR necessitates measuring four frequency bands (two signal-image pairs), instead of the two (one signal-image pair).\nThe Vivace platform is well suited to this task as its multifrequency lock-in can measure up to 32 bands.\nIt is also worth noting that $\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q$ and $\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q$ are frequency dependent and the relative difference is expected to vary as a function of CFO.\nIn our case, we used a CFO of 20kHz resulting in typical magnitude ratios of $|\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q|/|\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q| \\approx 1.007$ and phase ratios of $\\angle\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q/\\angle\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q \\approx 0.988$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nComparing the upconversion and downconversion ILR. Ideally the two quantities should be equal, as indicated by the black dashed line. Major deviations are due to faulty calibration. Small deviations are attributed to frequency dependent attenuation in the cryogenic electronics. Differences between the various methods are explained in the main text.\n\nFig. (Figure fig:up_down_conv) plots the upconversion ILR, as measured by the spectrum analyzer, vs. the downconversion ILR, as measured by Vivace.\nSuccessive iterations of the calibration are plotted as points, connected with dashed lines, starting in the upper right with large ILR, and proceeding toward the lower left with reduced ILR.\nThe colors represent different calibration scenarios.\nThe dashed diagonal line represents the ideal case.\nNotice that attempts to calibrate both up- and downconversion simultaneously while $\\langle Y_m Y_{-m} \\rangle \\neq 0$ (red), fail to produce the ideal result, as expected.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nCalibration with CFO as a function of iteration number.\nCalibration time is limited by the spectrum analyzer used to monitor the upconversion ILR.\nIf we remove this monitor, -70 dB ILR can be reached within a couple of seconds.\nThe imbalance parameters are $\\alpha = 0.923$ and $\\beta = -0.0327$, corresponding to $G_{\\text{up}} = 0.961$ and $\\phi_{\\text{up}} = -2.03^\\circ$.\n\nTwo calibrations using only noise (blue and orange) are depicted, the difference being the amount of time spent sampling noise (2s and 10s respectively).\nThe accuracy is decent for large ILR, but suffers as we approach -40 dB.\n\nThe calibration improves significantly if we use a signal and a CFO (green).\nWe can accurately reconstruct the ILR down to -70 dB.\nNotice the offset of roughly 3 dB from the diagonal, corresponding to an overestimate of the ILR at the downconversion stage.\nWe attribute this to an unequal attenuation of the sidebands in the cryogenic electronics.\n\nFinally, Fig. (Figure fig:CFO_down_conv) depicts calibration with CFO of two imbalanced mixers as a function of time.\nEach point corresponds to a complete loop around the chart in Fig. (Figure fig:flow_chart). The downconversion ILR is successfully suppressed to less than -60 dB with our setup, showing that we can calibrate both up- and downconversion mixers simultaneously. The offset from the upconversion ILR is attributed to frequency-dependent attenuation in the cryogenic electronics.\n\n## Conclusion\nCurrent IQ-mixer components for circuit QED experiments are analog devices that, due to their analog nature, come with imperfections and imbalances.\nThese imbalances can be mitigated by digital pre-distortion techniques.\nIn this paper, we have presented several such techniques to calibrate IQ mixers, both for up- and downconversion.\nThese techniques, originally developed for OFDM applications, are shown to be suitable for circuit-QED applications.\nBy careful combination of up- and downconversion techniques, it is possible to calibrate both stages simultaneously.\nIn addition, we show that it is possible to calibrate the mixers in situ, provided the frequency-dependent attenuation is not too large.\nWe believe this will pave the way for more efficient mixer-calibration procedures as superconducting-qubit processors continue to increase in size and complexity in the near future.\n\nWe acknowledge the financial support from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation through the Wallenberg Center for Quantum Technology (WACQT).\nWe also acknowledge Per Delsing and Simone Gasparinetti for helpful comments.\n\n*\naipnum4-1\n\n"}

cavities\nwith capacitive and inductive coupling\n\nkamigait@riken.jp\nRIKEN Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science\n\n2-1 Hirosawa, Wako-shi, Saitama 351-0198, Japan\n\nThe external-Q factor of a resonant mode of a cavity represents the strength of the\nelectromagnetic coupling between this resonant mode and the transmission mode of a waveguide coupled to the cavity.\nIn this paper, we derive formulas to explicitly give the external Q of the cavities coupled with the waveguide\nthrough capacitive and inductive coupling.\nThe derivation is based on the classical method that uses the reflection coefficient to estimate the coupling strength.\nAlthough the external Q is evaluated via three-dimensional computer simulations currently,\nthese formulas may be useful for making speculations in the initial stages of cavity design.\n\n## Introduction\nThe external-Q factor is a fundamental parameter of the cavity resonator; it determines the electromagnetic power\nradiated from the cavity to the waveguide.\nIn the case of superconducting cavities, the external Q is especially important because\nthe internal loss of rf power is negligible in comparison to the radiated power,\nand the bandwidth of the rf system is determined by the external Q.\nTherefore, it is essential to estimate the external Q while designing the cavity and rf system.\n\nThe standard method to evaluate the external Q is described in reference [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThis method uses the rf power radiated to the waveguide in addition to the cavity parameters\nto evaluate the external Q and coupling coefficient.\nIt also provides an equivalent circuit of the cavity coupled with the waveguide.\nThis treatment is widely used for the analysis of the cavity voltage because\nit precisely describes the electromagnetic field in the cavity.\n\nHowever, the aforementioned method has the following two problems.\nFirst, this method only yields an equivalent circuit coupled with an ideal transformer.\nTherefore, the properties of the actual circuit, such as the input impedance and reflection coefficient,\nare not correctly represented.\nSecond, the external Q can be obtained if only the input impedance, observed from the waveguide, is known[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nIn other words, the radiation power is not required to obtain the external Q.\n\nA general method to calculate the external Q using the input impedance is given in reference [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which,\nhowever, requires numerical calculation.\nTherefore, in this paper, we derive an explicit formulas to determine the external Q by another approach based on the reflection coefficient.\nWe will see that the external Q are expressed in terms of the cavity parameters,\nthrough calculations of the refection coefficient for the two commonly used coupling schemes,\ni.e., capacitive and inductive coupling.\n\n## Reflection coefficient and external Q\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nReflection coefficient $\\Gamma$ of a resonant cavity coupled with a waveguide\nrepresented on a Smith chart.\nThe minimum and maximum absolute values of the reflection coefficient are denoted by\n$\\left|\\Gamma_0 \\right|$ and $\\left|\\Gamma_1 \\right|$, respectively.\n\nLet us suppose a general condition where a resonant cavity is coupled with a waveguide.\nThe reflection coefficient $\\Gamma$ represents a circle in the Smith chart around the resonance frequency,\nas shown in Fig. (Figure fig:gammageneral).\nWe use this circle to obtain the coupling coefficient $\\beta$, which is defined\nby the ratio of the unloaded Q to the external Q, i.e.,\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:betadef}\n\\beta\\coloneqq\\frac{Q_0}{Q_{\\mbox {\\tiny ext}}}.\n\n$$\n\nTo this end, let the minimum and maximum absolute values of the reflection coefficient be $\\left|\\Gamma_0 \\right|$\nand $\\left|\\Gamma_1 \\right|$, respectively, as shown in Fig. (Figure fig:gammageneral).\nNote that the points corresponding to the minimum and maximum reflection coefficients are at opposite positions\nacross the origin of the complex plane because $\\Gamma$ is a circle.\nThen, the voltage standing wave ratios corresponding to the minimum and maximum values of $\\left| \\Gamma \\right|$ are\ngiven by\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:sigma0}\n\\sigma_0=\\frac{1+\\left|\\Gamma_0 \\right|}{1-\\left|\\Gamma_0 \\right|}\n\n$$\nand\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:sigma1}\n\\sigma_1=\\frac{1+\\left|\\Gamma_1 \\right|}{1-\\left|\\Gamma_1 \\right|},\n\n$$\nrespectively.\nAccording to reference [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the\ncoupling coefficient $\\beta$ can be given by\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:beta}\n\\beta = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l}\n\\displaystyle\\sigma_0-1/\\sigma_1 \\quad ({\\mbox {in the case of overcoupling}}), \\\\ \\\\\n1/\\sigma_0-1/\\sigma_1 \\quad ({\\mbox {in the case of undercoupling}}).\n\\end{array} \\right.\n\n$$\nTherefore, it is possible to obtain $Q_{\\mbox {\\tiny ext}}$ once $\\left|\\Gamma_0 \\right|$\nand $\\left|\\Gamma_1 \\right|$ are known\nfor a given cavity coupled with a waveguide.\n\n## Capacitive coupling\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nCircuit diagram representing a capacitively coupled cavity.\n\nConsider an LCR parallel resonant circuit coupled with a coaxial waveguide with\na characteristic\nimpedance $Z_0$ through the coupling capacitance $C_f$, as shown in Fig. (Figure fig:c).\nIt represents an equivalent circuit of a cavity coupled capacitively with the waveguide.\nThe resonance frequency and\nunloaded Q of the cavity are related to the circuit parameters as follows, respectively:\n$$\n\n\\omega_r&=&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L C}},\\\\\n\\label{eq:defq0}\nQ_0&=&\\omega_r  C  R.\n\n$$\nIn this paper, we assume that\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:zentei}\nZ_0 \\ll

(<ref>)\nmay be replaced with $\\omega_r$.\nTherefore, we consider the following equation instead of Eq. (<ref>).\n$$\n\nZ_a=\\frac{1}{j\\omega_r C_f}+\\frac{R}{1+j \\Delta}.\n\\label{eq:za}\n\n$$\nHere, we set\n$$\n\n\\Delta\\coloneqq Q_0 \\delta(\\omega).\n\\label{eq:Delta}\n\n$$\n\nThe real and imaginary parts of Eq.

Typically, these parameters are found through a series of bootstrapped calibration experiments which successively acquire more accurate information about a physical qubit. However, optimal parameters are typically different between devices and can also drift in time, which begets the need for an efficient calibration strategy. Here, we introduce a framework to understand the relationship between calibrations as a directed graph. With this approach, calibration is reduced to a graph traversal problem that is automatable and extensible.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nComputation on a quantum computer is realized by analog manipulations of large numbers of physical quantum bits (qubits). These control waveforms must be finely tuned as deviations from the ideal cause imperfect amplitudes and phases, inducing error. This presents a significant challenge as today's control hardware and qubit systems cannot be operated identically; each qubit's control must be calibrated individually, and ideal control parameters can drift in time. Furthermore, each qubit typically requires a host of different high fidelity operations, such as single-qubit rotations, multi-qubit gates, measurement, and reset for a digital quantum computer\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The field of quantum optimal control \u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] lies at the center of this challenge, where precise control over quantum systems has been demonstrated in state transfer\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], high-fidelity logic operations\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], combating control parameter drift\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and macroscopic quantum systems\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, quantum optimal control is typically applied to a single operation, such as calibrating a particular logic gate or quantum state. In this work, we focus on a broader challenge: how do we navigate the full suite of tasks required for a quantum computer, from initial device bring-up to logic operation calibration to algorithmic control?\n\nTypically, control parameters for a device are determined by following a carefully chosen sequence of calibration experiments, where the result of one experiment generally feeds into the next. The simplest strategy is to sequence through these experiments from start to end, in order. However, this breaks down with the introduction of parameter drift, the need for debugging, or the desire to reconfigure the system on-the-fly. Re-starting the sequence from the beginning repeatedly is non-ideal given the considerable time expense of the calibration sequence. Simply put, there is a need to move fluidly both forwards and backwards through a sequence of experiments, and for a way to represent the relationship between calibration experiments.\n\nFor small systems, complex calibrations and parameter drift can be handled by careful, manual tuning. Here, an adept user can navigate forwards and backwards through experiments for a handful of qubits, as they have learned the relationships between experiments through experience. It is this experience that provides inspiration for our work.\n\nNaturally, manual control is not scalable, so a fully autonomous solution is desireable to operate systems with more than a few dozen qubits. Our goal for this paper is to provide a high-level description of the interplay between calibration experiments, and how this can be used to identify and maintain control parameters for a quantum computer.\n\nTHE CALIBRATION PROBLEM\n\nWe define the calibration problem as follows:  What is the optimal way to identify and maintain control parameters for a system of physical qubits given incomplete system information? To begin, we define the following terms:\n\nParameter A qubit control parameter, such as the driving duration of a pi-pulse.\n\nExperiment A collection of static control waveforms and measurements where no parameters are varied. This may correspond to, for example, a gate sequence and measurement to determine the output probability distribution or a gate sequence and tomography to interrogate the state of the qubit(s). Typically each experiment is repeated a number of times to gather statistics.\n\nScan A collection of experiments where one or more parameters are varied. For example, a rabi driving scan where the length of the drive pulse is changed for each individual experiment. Scans can also be more complex, e.g. multi-parameter optimizations.\n\nFigure of merit A number measured using a scan or experiment used to quantify how well a qubit is operating.\n\nTolerance A threshold on a figure of merit for determining whether the control parameters are determined well enough. For example, we may specify that a pi pulse should be within $10^{-4}$ radians of a $\\pi$ rotation.\n\nSpec A figure of merit is either within tolerance (in spec) or not (out of spec).\n\nCalibrations (Cals)\n\nWe define a calibration (cal) as a procedure used to determine a new value for one or more parameters. A cal consists of the following components:\n\n* A set of parameters that are targets of cal.\n\n* A scan used to generate experimental data relevant to the parameters.\n\n* Functions used to analyze the experimental data to determine figures of merit. The figures of merit are used to determine if the parameters are in spec, and what the optimal parameter values are.\n\nThe Calibration loop\n\nCals share a generic structure, as follows:\n\n* Run scan.\n\n* Analyze data to determine optimal parameter values.\n\n* Update parameters.\n\nIn fully calibrating a system of qubits, this procedure is followed through a collection of different cal procedures across all of the qubits.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nAn example of a rabi driving cal. (1) The rabi driving scan is performed, consisting of a collection of experiments, where each experiment has a single drive length, and the average probability of the $\\ket{0}$ state is measured. (2) The data is analyzed, and the optimal drive length is determined. (3) The qubit parameter for the driving length of an X pulse is updated to the optimal value.\n\nDependencies\n\nMuch of the complexity in determining control parameters arises because calibration experiments can depend on one another. The process of calibrating a qubit uses bootstrapping, where parameters discovered from simple cals are fed into more sophisticated cals which enhance the control capabilities of a qubit beyond what could be done initially. In the rabi driving example (Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:rabi)), this scan can only be performed once we know the frequency at which to drive the qubit. In turn the qubit frequency cal can only be performed once we know how to measure the state of the qubit. In general, a cal can depend on parameters derived from other cals, which can themselves depend on other cals. This is especially tricky in the presence of drift: a parameter that drifts from its calibrated value during subsequent cals can poison the data.\n\nOPTIMUS\n\nOur goal is to build a system to solve the calibration problem with the following properties:\n\n* Calibrates a qubit system automatically from scratch (from its unknown initial state).\n\n* Chooses the sequence of calibrations to perform.\n\n* Takes a minimal amount of wall clock time.\n\n* Handles parameter drift, i.e. has a strategy for detecting drift and revisiting calibrations that may have drifted.\n\n* Detects if a calibration is working improperly via self-diagnosis.\n\nThe calibration graph\n\nWe introduce our approach to the calibration problem, named Optimus, which satisfies these properties. The essential insight of Optimus is to formulate the dependency relationships between calibrations as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each cal is represented by a node in the graph, and each dependence between cals is a directed edge. The direction of the edge denotes which cal depends on the other. For example, in Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:graph) we see that cal B depends on cal A, while cal 1 depends on cals D and F. Cal A is a root cal; it does not depend on any other cals and so can be run on a qubit system in an otherwise unknown state.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nCalibrations in a directed acyclic graph. As an example, we have an algorithm that we would like to run that depends on high fidelity single-qubit gates (1), two-qubit gates (2) and measurement (M). In turn, these cals have a graph of dependencies which extend back to the root.\n\nWhere does system knowledge live?\n\nSo far, we have only outlined a generic control system, and have not touched on where specific system information should live. Any person who has spent extensive time working with qubits has built up significant system specific knowledge, such as roughly what calibrations should be run in what order to bring up a qubit, what data for various experiments should look like, and what typical operation parameters are. So where does this information live?\n\nThe Optimus framework allows one to codify all of that lab experience explicitly into the graph in a useful way. The dependency structure of the graph, which experiments are used on each node, the tolerances for those experiments, analysis functions, etc all represent our knowledge of how the system works. We expect that these specifics will be different from a superconducting qubit system to that of ion traps or quantum dots, or even a different design of superconducting qubit. Even among one particular system there is some freedom in how the graph is constructed, and this is a good thing. We may use different graphs for different purposes, such as standard characterization vs high fidelity algorithm operation.\n\nBy putting all of this system knowledge into the calibration graph, multiple users can contribute to the collective knowledge of the best operating procedure. In manual operation, it takes time for new users to become familiar with all of the elements of system calibration, and users of different experience levels typically handle the system differently. Now, the graph represents the communal best working knowledge of how to solve the calibration problem. If one user finds a better way to write a node or structure the graph, they can systematically improve the calibration routine and distribute that to other users as the nodes are modular. The graph is also useful as a pedagogical tool, as it explicitly describes the relationships between calibrations, analysis functions, and thresholds.\n\nThe calibration problem on a DAG\n\nIn addition to the graph structure, we also introduce the state, which represents all current knowledge of the system based on previously acquired data. This knowledge is similar to an experimentalists lab notes: it contains information on which cals are working and when they were last run, for example. Each cal can be in a different state: \u201cin spec\u201d denoting that the figures of merit associated with the cal are in spec, or \u201cout of spec\u201d if they are out of spec. For example if we just successfully ran a cal we would mark it as in spec; if it failed we would mark it as out of spec; finally, if the state is unknown we would assume it is out of spec until validated. By definition, a cal cannot be in spec if it has a dependency out of spec; we address how to determine the state of the system in section\u00a0<ref>. With this formalism, we can restate the calibration problem in terms of the DAG, as seen in Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:anystate).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nThe calibration problem can be formulated in terms of a DAG. The dependency arrows point towards the root. The goal of the calibration problem is to take systems with little information (A) or partial information (B, C) and bring them to the state where all cals are in spec. *Note that cals where the state is unknown (e.g. never previously measured) are assumed to be out of spec.\n\nTo help combat parameter drift, we also associate a timeout period with each cal, and record the time when the cal was last run. The timeout period is the characteristic drift time, or the timescale that we expect that the parameters associated with the cal should be validated or updated. Note that these timeout periods can be experimentally determined by processing data generated from system operation.\n\nInteracting with calibrations\n\nThere are a number of ways of interacting with calibrations, depending on what information we are trying to learn. In an effort to reduce the amount of time Optimus consumes (the cost of calibrations), we introduce three methods, , , and . These three functions gate expensive calibrations that may not be needed: , , and  acquire no data, little data, and lots of data respectively. Importantly, only  (which acquires significant amounts of data) is used to update parameter values, as it provides the highest confidence.\n\ncheck_state\n\nanswers the question, \u201cBased on our prior knowledge of the system, and without experiments, are we confident the figures of merit associated with this cal are in spec?\u201d The purpose of  is to help higher level algorithms determine where to allocate resources running experiments.\n\nshould report a pass if and only if the following are satisfied:\n\n* The cal has had  or  pass within the timeout period.\n\n* The cal has not failed  without resolution.\n\n* No dependencies have been recalibrated since the last time  or  was run on this cal.\n\n* All dependencies pass .\n\ncheck_data\n\nThe purpose of  is to experimentally determine the state of the node, while running a minimal number of experiments.  answers two questions, \u201cIs the parameter associated with this cal in spec, and is the cal scan working as expected?\u201d\n\nThis can be understood with a Rabi driving cal example, as shown in Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:checkdata).  takes a minimal amount of data (the red points), which we superimpose onto the black dots, representing what we expect the data to look like. In the first case, we see that the red dots lie within acceptable tolerance of the black dots indicating that our parameter matches the expectation for the experiment and is in spec. In the second case, we see that there is a shift between where the expected and actual minimal of the curve are, indicating the parameter is out of spec (which is recorded in the state). In the third case, we see that the data looks like noise instead of lying on a curve, indicating that the scan for this cal is not working and returning bad data. When we receive bad data, it likely indicates that a dependence for this cal has a bad state.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nuses a minimal number of points to distinguish between three cases. Case 1: the data lies on top of the expected data indicating the parameter is in spec. Case 2: the data are offset from the expected data, indicating the parameter is not in spec. Case 3: The data is noise, indicating a dependency is bad.\n\ncalibrate\n\nis the canonical calibration loop described above. We allow  to take as much  data as needed to determine the optimal value for a parameter. We then analyze the data and update the parameter associated with the cal. Additionally, we verify that the data generated by the calibration scan are not bad data. In the case of bad data, we generate an error as bad data should have been caught previously by .\n\nCalibration attributes\n\nFor completeness, we elaborate on what constitutes a calibration node:\n\n* Parameter(s) that are the target of cal.\n\n* Scans used to generate experimental data relevant to the parameter(s).\n\n*  scan (minimal data).\n\n* calibration scan (more data).\n\n* Helper functions for analysis.\n\n*  analysis.\n\n*  analysis.\n\n* Supplementary checks, e.g. for qubit parameter inconsistencies.\n\n* Tolerances for a figure of merit.\n\n* Timeout period.\n\nGraph traversal\n\nWith the specifics of how cals are defined and how we can interact with them, system calibration is now reduced to a graph traversal problem. So, we need algorithms to determine which cals to run, and the order they will execute.\n\nWith this in mind, we introduce two algorithms for navigating the DAG:  and . The specific nature of these algorithms is to minimize the amount of time is the required to bring the system back to a good state.\n\nMaintain concept\n\nis the primary interface for Optimus, and is the highest level algorithm. We call  on the cal that we want in spec, and  will call all necessary subroutines to get that node in spec. The goal of  is to only begin acquiring data on the node closest to root that fails . We do this as we want to begin changing parameters on the least dependent calibration and work forwards from there.\n\nAt the first node that fails , the  algorithm will begin interrogating state of the node experimentally with . Depending on the outcome, it will either proceed (in spec),  and proceed (out of spec), or call  (bad data), see Fig\u00a0(Figure fig:maintain). It will then continue iterating through the graph using this basic strategy.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nis called on the cal we want in a good state, and is called recursively down to the root node. The node closest to the root which fails  runs , and decide to proceed, , or call  depending on the outcome. We iterate recursively through the graph with this strategy.\n\nDiagnose concept\n\nis a separate algorithm that is called by , in the special case that  identifies bad data. The  algorithm represents a strategy shift from ;  makes no calls to  and only makes decisions based on data returned from  and , see Fig\u00a0(Figure fig:diagnose). This can be understood by realizing that  assumes that our knowledge of the state of the system matches the actual state of the system. If we knew a cal would return bad data, we wouldn't dedicate experiments to it.  is only invoked when we have experimentally determined there is a mismatch between the actual system state and our knowledge of the system state. So, the purpose of  is to repair inaccuracies in our knowledge of the state of the system, so that  can resume.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDiagnose is called on a cal that has returned bad data from . We then investigate each of the dependents. If a dependent is in spec, we continue to other dependents of the original cal. If it is out of spec, we  and proceed towards the original cal. If we get bad data, we recursively .\n\nSaving time\n\nWe design  to start in the optimal location (to the best of our knowledge) to avoid extra work. For example, if a node times out, so that we can no longer consider it to be in spec, then all higher-level nodes that depend on it (directly or indirectly) are also out of spec. So, to bring the system back into a good state, we want to begin with the lowest-level node that we determine to be out of spec and work upwards from there. This minimizes the work we have to do because we should not bother trying to tune up a higher level node when we know a lower-level dependency is not in spec.\n\nSimilarly, switching directions in the  phase after we find bad data is also a way to avoid doing extra work. When we find that the data for a particular node is bad, even though we believe that its dependencies are in spec, we first check the immediate dependencies more carefully. If these can be brought back into spec, then we are all good and can continue. We don't immediately jump to the conclusion that every dependent node all the way back to the root is bad, which would cause us to start over and do a lot of extra work. So we switch directions and work from the top down in the  phase.\n\nNote on acyclicity\n\nAcyclicity is a desirable property for the graph to have, as it makes the graph traversal algorithms easier to build and control. However, our systems are not naturally acyclic. To handle this, we can unwrap a cyclic dependence into layers of precision. For example, as in Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:acyclicity) if A and B both depend on each other, we can unwrap it into layers of coarse, mid, and fine calibration. By doing this, we essentially iterate through parameter space until we achieve the desired level of precision. Alternatively, in some cases we can design a cal scan that simultaneously optimizes both parameters. Deciding between these cases is an element of the overall DAG design.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nAcyclicity can be removed by unwrapped cyclic dependencies into layers of precision. This allows us to iterate back and forth updating parameters until they are both finely tuned.\n\nHandling Errors\n\nIn some cases, we may raise errors when encountering unexpected behavior. For example, we raise a DiagnoseError if we find that  was invoked, but no dependencies were out of spec. In this case (assuming we have defined tolerances that are physically achievable), it is possible the device is behaving in a non-ideal manner, or the DAG does not accurately represent the system behavior. We can try bringing up the device in a different operating condition, or mark it as bad.\n\nMulti-qubit calibrations\n\nSystem tune-up requires multi-qubit calibrations in addition to single-qubit calibrations. Ensuring these behave as expected involves unifying methods such as  to to work in the following way: if one qubit fails  due to some dependency but the other succeeds, the multi-qubit node should fail . These issues can be addressed in the specific software implementation.\n\nExtensibility to other physical systems\n\nWe have written Optimus with control over physical qubit systems for quantum computing. However this approach is generically applicable to a variety of platforms that require careful calibration of a physical system.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nWe have presented Optimus as a solution to the calibration problem, where we reformulated the suite of calibration scans as a directed acyclic graph. We then defined a number of methods of interacting with different cals as a way to minimize the number of experiments require to fully calibrate a system. Doing this allows us to use graph traversal strategies to tackle the calibration problem. We have been using Optimus to successfully automate the calibration of multi-qubit systems.\n\ntocchapterBibliography\napsrev\n\n"}

We present a circuit design that effectively eliminates spontaneous emission due to the Purcell effect while maintaining strong coupling to a low $Q$ cavity.  Excellent agreement over a wide range in frequency is found between measured qubit relaxation times and the predictions of a circuit model.  Using fast (nanosecond time-scale) flux biasing of the qubit, we demonstrate in-situ control of qubit lifetime over a factor of 50.  We realize qubit reset with 99.9\n\nIn circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED), engineered artificial atoms used as quantum bits (qubits) interact strongly with the electromagnetic modes of a transmission-line microwave cavity [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  The large qubit-photon coupling affords capabilities such as coherent interactions of qubit and photon states [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], large coupling between spatially separated qubits mediated by the cavity bus [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and non-destructive joint qubit readout [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  However, this strong coupling can also cause undesirable shortening of qubit lifetime ($T_{1}$) due to radiative decay through the cavity [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  This effect, first described by E.\u00a0M. Purcell, describes a quantized system coupled to a resonant circuit or cavity [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  Depending on the detuning of the system transition frequency from the cavity resonance frequency, the rate of decay of the quantum system can be strongly enhanced [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] or suppressed [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] compared with the decay rate to the electromagnetic continuum.  In cQED, qubits are generally sufficiently detuned to have suppressed relaxation, but $T_{1}$ can still be limited by decay through the cavity.  As qubit lifetime is of paramount importance in quantum computing [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], a means of further inhibiting radiative decay is desirable.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDesign, realization, and diagnostic transmission data of the Purcell filter.  (a) Circuit model of the Purcell-filtered cavity design.  The Purcell filter, implemented with twin $\\lambda/4$ open-circuited transmission-line stubs, inhibits decay through $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$ near its resonance $\\omega_{\\mathrm{f}}$.  (b) Optical micrograph of the device with inset zoom on transmon qubit.  Note the correspondence of the circuit elements directly above in (a).  (c) Cavity transmission measured at 4.2\u00a0K and comparison to the circuit-model prediction.  The Purcell filter shorts out the 50\u00a0$\\Omega$ output environment at $\\omega_{\\mathrm{f}}$, yielding a 30\u00a0dB drop in transmission (arrow).  A circuit model involving only the parameters $C_{\\mathrm{in}}$, $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{c}}$, and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{f}}$ shows excellent correspondence.\n\nThe Purcell decay rate can be significantly reduced [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] by increasing either the cavity quality factor $Q$ or the detuning between the qubit ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{q}}$) and cavity ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{c}}$) frequencies, $\\Delta=\\omega_{\\mathrm{q}}-\\omega_{\\mathrm{c}}$, but these solutions have unwelcome implications of their own.  For example, reducing the cavity decay rate $\\kappa = \\omega_{\\mathrm{c}} / Q$ can diminish qubit readout fidelity [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] because fewer signal photons are collected in a qubit lifetime.  A large $\\kappa$ is also beneficial for resetting a qubit to its ground state by bringing it near to the cavity resonance and exploiting the Purcell-enhanced decay rate.  Increasing $\\Delta$ similarly has adverse effects on  readout fidelity and applications that exploit large state-dependent frequency shifts [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  A better solution would improve qubit $T_{1}$ independent of the cavity $Q$, leaving its optimization up to other experimental concerns.\n\nIn this Letter, we introduce a design element for cQED termed the \u201cPurcell filter\u201d, which protects a qubit from spontaneous emission while maintaining strong coupling to a low-$Q$ cavity.  We demonstrate an improvement of qubit $T_{1}$ by up to a factor of 50 compared to predicted values for an unfiltered device with the same $\\kappa/2\\pi\\approx 20\\mhz$.  Combining the large dynamic range of almost two orders of magnitude in $T_{1}$ with fast flux control, we then demonstrate fast qubit reset to 99\n\nThe filter works by exploiting the fact that the qubit and cavity are typically far detuned.  We can therefore modify the qubit's electromagnetic environment (e.g. the density of photon states at $\\omega_{\\mathrm{q}}$) without, in principle, affecting the cavity $Q$ or resonant transmission.  The relationship between qubit $T_{1}$ due to spontaneous emission and admittance $Y$ of the coupled environment is  $$\nT^{\\mathrm{Purcell}}_{1}=\\frac{C_{q}}{\\mathrm{Re}[Y(\\omega_{\\mathrm{q}})]},\n$$ where $C_{\\mathrm{q}}$ is the qubit capacitance [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circuit)(a)] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Previous work [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] has demonstrated that Eq.\u00a0(1) accurately models the observed $T^{\\mathrm{Purcell}}_{1}$ when all modes of the cavity are taken into account in the calculation of $Y$.  As the relationship holds for any admittance, this decay rate can be controlled by adjusting $Y$ with conventional microwave engineering techniques.  In particular, by manipulating $Y$ to be purely reactive (imaginary-valued) at $\\omega_{\\mathrm{q}}$, $T^{\\mathrm{Purcell}}_{1}$ diverges and the Purcell decay channel is turned off.  This solution decouples the choice of cavity $Q$ from the Purcell decay rate as desired, and, as we will see,  has the advantage of using only conventional circuit elements placed in an experimentally convenient location.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nQubit $T_{1}$ as a function of frequency measured with two methods, and comparison to various models. The first method is a static measurement (circles): the qubit is excited and measured after a wait time $\\tau$. The second (triangles) is a dynamic measurement: the qubit frequency is tuned with a fast flux pulse to an interrogation frequency, excited, and allowed to decay for $\\tau$, and then returned to its operating frequency of $5.16\\ghz$ and measured.  This method allows for accurate measurement even when $T_{1}$ is extremely short.  Measurements using the two methods show near perfect overlap. The top dashed curve is the predicted $T^{\\mathrm{Purcell}}_{1}$, while solid curve includes also non-radiative internal loss with best-fit $Q_{\\mathrm{NR}}=2\\pi f T^{\\mathrm{NR}}_{1}\\approx27,000$.  The two lower curves correspond to an unfiltered device with the same $C_{\\mathrm{in}}$, $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$, and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{c}}$, with and without the internal loss. In this case, the Purcell filter gives a $T_{1}$ improvement by up to a factor of $\\sim$50 ($6.7\\ghz$).\n\nWe implement the Purcell filter with a transmission-line stub terminated in an open circuit placed outside the output capacitor $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$ [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circuit)(a)].  The length of this stub is set such that it acts as a $\\lambda/4$ impedance transformer to short out the $50~\\Omega$ environment at its resonance frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{f}}$.  We choose $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$ to be much larger than the input capacitor, $C_{\\mathrm{in}}\\approx~C_{\\mathrm{out}}/15$, to ensure that the qubit would be overwhelmingly likely to decay through $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$.  The Purcell filter eliminates decay through this channel, leaving only the negligible decay rate through $C_{\\mathrm{in}}$.  The combined total capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{tot}}\\approx80~\\mathrm{fF}$ results in a small cavity $Q$.  We use two identical stubs above and below the major axis of the chip [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circuit)(b)] to keep the design symmetric in an effort to suppress any undesired on-chip modes.  The cavity resonates at $\\omega_{\\mathrm{c}}/2\\pi=8.04\\ghz$, the filter at $\\omega_{\\mathrm{f}}/2\\pi=6.33\\ghz$, and a  flux bias line (FBL) is used to address a single transmon qubit [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] with a maximum frequency of $9.8\\ghz$, a charging energy $E_{\\mathrm{C}}/2\\pi$ of $350\\mhz$, and a resonator coupling strength $g/2\\pi$ of $270\\mhz$.  Transmission through the cavity measured at 4.2\u00a0K was compared with our model to validate the microwave characteristics of the device [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circuit)(c)].  There is a dip corresponding to inhibited decay through $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$ at $\\omega_{\\mathrm{f}}$.  The predicted and measured curves are also qualitatively similar, lending credence to the circuit model.  This method provided a convenient validation before cooling the device to 25\u00a0mK in a helium dilution refrigerator.\n\nWe measured the qubit $T_{1}$ as function of frequency and found it to be in excellent agreement with expectations.  $T_{1}$ is well modeled by the sum of the Purcell rate predicted by our filtered circuit model and a non-radiative internal loss $Q_{\\mathrm{NR}}\\approx27,000$ (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:lifetime)).  The source of this loss is a topic of current research, though some candidates are surface two level systems [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], dielectric loss of the tunnel barrier oxide [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] or corundum substrate, and non-equilibrium quasiparticles [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].   This model contains only the fit parameter $Q_{\\mathrm{NR}}$ combined with the independently measured values of $g$, $E_{\\mathrm{C}}$, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{c}}$, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{f}}$, $C_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$.  An improvement to $T_{1}$ due to the Purcell filter was found to be as much as a factor of 50 at $6.7\\ghz$ by comparison to an unfiltered circuit model with the same parameters.  This would be much greater in the absence of $Q_{\\mathrm{NR}}$.  The device also exhibits a large dynamic range in $T_{1}$: about a factor of 80 between the longest and shortest times measured.\n\nThis range in $T_{1}$ can be a challenge to quantify because measurements made at small detunings, where $T_{1}$ is a few tens of nanoseconds, have a very low SNR.  This issue was avoided through the use of fast flux control [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  For measurements at small $\\Delta$, the qubit is pulsed to the detuning under scrutiny, excited and allowed to decay, then pulsed to $5.16\\ghz$ where measurement fidelity is higher, and interrogated.  In the cases where the qubit is nearly in resonance with the cavity, the $T_{1}$ is actually so short that it constitutes an interesting resource.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nFast qubit reset.  (a) Schematic of a pulse sequence used to realize a qubit reset and characterize its performance.  The fidelity of reset was quantified using a modified Rabi oscillation scheme.  The qubit is first rotated around the $x$-axis by an angle $\\theta$ at the operating frequency of $5.16\\ghz$ and then pulsed into near resonance with the cavity (solid line) or left at the operating frequency (dashed line) for a time $\\tau$.  The state of the qubit is measured as a function of $\\theta$ and $\\tau$ after being pulsed back to $5.16\\ghz$.\n(b) The Rabi-oscillation amplitude as a function of $\\tau$, normalized to the amplitude for $\\tau$=0.  This ratio gives the deviation of the qubit state from equilibrium.  Curves are fit to exponentials with decay constants of 16.9\u00a0$\\pm$\u00a00.1\u00a0ns and 540\u00a0$\\pm$\u00a020\u00a0ns respectively. Insets: Measured Rabi oscillations for $\\tau$=0 (lower left) and $\\tau$=80\u00a0ns (top right).  The vertical scales differ by a factor of 100.\n\nThe ability to reset, or quickly cool a qubit to its equilibrium state on demand, is an important capability with a diverse set of applications.  Using a qubit to make repeated measurements of a coupled system, for example, requires resetting the qubit between interrogations [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  Similarly, experiment repetition rates can be greatly enhanced when they are otherwise limited by $T_{1}$.  Fast reset is also vital for measurement-free quantum error correction [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  In this scheme, an error syndrome is encoded in two ancilla qubits and conditionally corrected using a three qubit gate.  The ancillas, which now hold the entropy associated with the error, are then reset and reused. The Purcell filter is an ideal element with which to demonstrate reset as it allows for a relatively short reset time through the use of a low-$Q$ cavity without limiting $T_{1}$ at the operating frequency.\n\nThe efficacy of reset in this device is readily quantified using a modified Rabi oscillation sequence, described in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:reset)(a).  Each experiment measures the degree to which the qubit is out of equilibrium after some reset time $\\tau$; the protocol is insensitive to any equilibrium thermal population of the qubit.  The non-equilibrium population is found to exhibit pure exponential decay over three orders of magnitude.  The qubit can be reset to 99.9\n\nThe Purcell filter is an important design element for cQED which allows for the use of low-$Q$ cavities without adversely affecting qubit $T_{1}$.  This ability is well-suited for in-situ qubit reset, a prerequisite for measurement-free quantum error correction and other applications.  We have observed high fidelity qubit measurements using both linear dispersive [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and Jaynes-Cummings readouts [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] in this device, and a quantitative comparison with an unfiltered device remains for future work.\n\nWe acknowledge helpful discussions with M.\u00a0H.\u00a0Devoret and L.\u00a0S.\u00a0Bishop.

The phase of these drives can be used to generate zero-duration arbitrary \u201cvirtual\u201d Z-gates which, combined with two $X_{\\pi/2}$ gates, can generate any SU(2) gate. Here we show how to best utilize these virtual Z-gates to both improve algorithms and correct pulse errors. We perform randomized benchmarking using a Clifford set of Hadamard and Z-gates and show that the error per Clifford is reduced versus a set consisting of standard finite-duration X and Y gates. Z-gates can correct unitary rotation errors for weakly anharmonic qubits as an alternative to pulse shaping techniques such as DRAG. We investigate leakage and show that a combination of DRAG pulse shaping to minimize leakage and Z-gates to correct rotation errors (DRAGZ) realizes a 13.3\u00a0ns $X_{\\pi/2}$ gate characterized by low error ($1.95[3]\\times 10^{-4}$) and low leakage ($3.1[6]\\times 10^{-6}$). Ultimately leakage is limited by the finite temperature of the qubit, but this limit is two orders-of-magnitude smaller than pulse errors due to decoherence.\n\nComputers based on quantum bits (qubits) are predicted to outperform classical computers for certain critical problems, e.g., factoring. Unlike a classical bit, which is discretely in the state 0 or 1, a qubit can be in a superposition state $|\\Psi\\rangle=\\cos(\\theta/2)|0\\rangle + e^{i\\phi}\\sin(\\theta/2)|1\\rangle$  where $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ are the quantum versions of the classical 0 and 1 states. This single-qubit superposition state can be geometrically represented as a point on the surface of a  unit-sphere known as the Bloch sphere. Critical to implementing a quantum computer is the ability to control the state of the qubit, i.e., transform the qubit state arbitrarily between two points on the Bloch sphere. This is accomplished by unitary transformations (gates), which correspond to rotations of the state around different axes in the Bloch sphere representation. Physically, X and Y gates (rotations around the X and Y axes) are generated by modulating the coupling between the states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ at the frequency difference between these states $\\omega_{01}=(E_{|1\\rangle}-E_{|0\\rangle})/\\hbar$. This modulation drive has the general form $\\Omega(t) \\cos(\\omega_{D} t - \\gamma)$ where $\\Omega(t)$ is the drive strength of the rotation, $\\omega_D$ is the drive frequency ($\\omega_D=\\omega_{01}$ on resonance) and $\\gamma$ is the drive phase. The duration of the gate is set by the desired rotation angle and the drive strength. On-resonance, when $\\gamma=0$, the qubit state rotates around the X axis and when $\\gamma=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ the rotation is around the Y axis. Therefore, the geometric X and Y axes in the Bloch sphere correspond to a real $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ phase difference between drive fields.\n\nRotations around the remaining axis (Z axis), i.e., Z-gates, correspond to a change in the relative phase between the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ states. A Z-gate can be implemented by either detuning the frequency of the qubit with respect to the drive field for some finite amount of time (e.g. see Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]) or by composite X and Y gates. The result is that the qubit state rotates with respect to the X and Y axes. However, it is equivalent to rotate the axes with respect to the qubit state \u2013 such a gate is known as a virtual Z-gate which corresponds to adding a phase offset to the drive field for all subsequent X and Y gates. This includes adding a phase offset to any two-qubit drives such as a drive used to implement a CNOT gate via cross-resonance\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In many qubit implementations this phase, $\\gamma$, is defined by classical control hardware and software. A Z-gate implemented in this way is essentially perfect; the classical hardware is self-calibrated via a global frequency reference (e.g., an atomic clock) and the gate has zero duration. Virtual-Z (VZ) gates have long been used in quantum experiments such as in NMR\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], ions\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and superconducting qubits\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Utilizing these gates can improve the overall fidelity of a quantum circuit if the circuit is optimized to maximize the number of single-qubit Z-gates. Additionally, any arbitrary rotation in the Bloch sphere can be generated by combining Z and $X_{\\pi/2}$ gates. This greatly simplifies calibration procedures because only a single drive strength must be calibrated.\n\nFurthermore, Z-gates can compensate for certain unitary errors which occur in physical qubit implementations. For example, when driving X and Y rotations in weakly anharmonic superconducting transmon qubits\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] there are unitary rotation errors (Stark shifts errors) and population leakage. Both of these errors can be corrected by implementing a full DRAG pulse\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which involves pulse shaping and dynamic frequency tuning. However, only the pulse shaping component of DRAG is typically implemented\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which cannot simultaneously correct both errors (we herein refer to DRAG by this definition). In most experiments DRAG is optimized to correct the more dominant unitary errors. This problem is solved by adding VZ-gates since VZ-gates can correct unitary phase errors while pulse shaping is then optimized to minimize leakage. Similar errors are common when driving two-qubit gates, such as the parametric iSWAP\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], cross-resonance\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and adiabatic CZ\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], so VZ-gates plus pulse shaping is also applicable in multiqubit systems.\n\nIn this paper we explore how the VZ-gate can be used to minimize circuit error and, for superconducting transmon qubits, minimize pulse errors. First, we review the theory of the VZ-gate and show one specific formula for an arbitrary SU(2) gate. Next, we compare randomized benchmarking\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] of a qubit using Cliffords generated from two different sets of basis gates \u2013 one set using X and Y rotations and the other set using X and Z rotations.  We show that the error per Clifford is lower for the XZ basis set, since the the number of finite-duration gates (i.e., X and Y rotations) required to represent each Clifford gate is reduced. We also perform interleaved benchmarking of the $S$ gate ($Z_{\\pi/2}$) and measure an error rate that is consistent with a perfect gate. Next, we demonstrate that VZ-gates can be used to compensate Stark-shift errors that arise when driving most X and Y rotations in weakly anharmonic systems. This technique, Gaussian plus Z (GZ), is a straightfoward alternative to the commonly used DRAG pulse\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. We show via randomized benchmarking that the pulse error for DRAG and GZ is essentially equivalent. Next, we measure population leakage to the $|2\\rangle$ state during these RB sequences (see Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for similar work). We show that GZ and DRAG (optimized for fidelity) have similar leakage rates. Combining DRAG and VZ-gates (DRAGZ) improves leakage without a loss of fidelity as does passive filtering plus VZ-gates (FILTZ). For pulses longer than 25\u00a0ns we find that the leakage rates for all methods are similar and limited by heating. Finally, we discuss some considerations when using these gates in a multi-qubit system.\n\n## Theory\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color Online) Schematic of the typical experimental setup for generating shaped microwave pulses for driving superconducting qubits.\n\nTo elucidate the concept of the virtual Z-gate (VZ-gate), we first review basic single qubit gates as they are physically realized in many labs, i.e., with a local oscillator (LO) shaped by an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) through an IQ mixer (setup shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:1a)). The LO is a single tone microwave source that outputs a constant signal $\\cos(\\omega_{LO}t)$. The AWG outputs a programmable series of discrete voltage points at a specific sample rate, e.g., for the Tektronix 5014 used in these experiments that sample rate is 1.2GSa/s (0.833ns between points). These points are internally filtered so that the output is a smooth waveform. Including this filter ($F$), the AWG output is\n$$\n\nV(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} d\\tau F(t-\\tau) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} V_n \\sqcap(n-\\tau/T) \\label{eqn:awgfilt}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\{V_n\\}$ is the set of AWG voltages, $T$ is the AWG period and $\\sqcap(x)$ is a pulse function defined as $\\sqcap(x)=\\{1,0\\}$ conditioned on $|x|\\le 1/2$. The IQ mixer multiplies the I and Q channels with the LO such that,\n$$\n\nV_{RF}(t) & = & V_{I}(t)\\cos(\\omega_{LO}t)  \\nonumber \\\\\n& & + V_{Q}(t)[1+\\epsilon_Q]\\sin(\\omega_{LO}t+\\epsilon_{\\phi}) \\nonumber \\\\\n& & + \\epsilon_{LO}\\cos(\\omega_{LO} t)\n\n$$\nwhere the $\\epsilon$ terms are non-ideal errors common to IQ mixers.\n\nThe AWG voltages are used to shape the pulse and shift the pulse frequency to resonance via single sideband (SSB) modulation. If the desired pulse envelope is $\\Omega(t)$ and the drive frequency is $\\omega_{D}=\\omega_{LO}+\\omega_{SSB}$ then the output of an ideal AWG (ignoring the pixelation and filtering described by Eqn.\u00a0<ref>) is,\n$$\n\nV_{I}(t) & = & \\Omega(t) \\cos(\\omega_{SSB} t - \\gamma), \\\\\nV_{Q}(t) & = & -\\Omega(t) \\sin(\\omega_{SSB} t - \\gamma).\n\n$$\nThese AWG signals, when applied to the inputs of an ideal mixer, output the desired drive pulse\n$$\n\nV_{RF}(t) & = & \\Omega(t) \\cos(\\omega_{D} t - \\gamma). \\label{eqn:pulse_drive}\n\n$$\nA series of $n$ shaped microwave pulses driving an anharmonic oscillator (a good description of a transmon qubit) is described by the Hamiltonian (in the lab frame),\n$$\n\nH/\\hbar & = & \\sum_{n} \\Omega_{n}(t) \\cos(\\omega_D t +\\gamma_n) (\\hat{a}+\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}) + \\omega_{01} \\hat{n} \\nonumber \\\\\n& & + \\frac{\\alpha}{2} (\\hat{n}-1)\\hat{n},\n\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{a}(\\hat{a}^{\\dagger})$ is the annihilation (creation) operator of the oscillator, $\\hat{n}=\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}$ is the number operator and $\\alpha$ is the anharmonicity. The $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ levels of this oscillator are the qubit levels. Leakage to higher levels and unitary errors due to mixing with these levels will be discussed in \u00a0<ref> and <ref>. For simplicity we rewrite just the qubit Hamiltonian,\n$$\n\nH/\\hbar = \\sum_{n} \\Omega_{n}(t) \\cos(\\omega_D t - \\gamma_n) \\hat{\\sigma}_X - \\frac{\\omega_{01}}{2} \\hat{\\sigma}_Z,\n\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_{X},\\hat{\\sigma}_{Z}$ are the Pauli operators. For a resonant drive ($\\omega_D=\\omega_{01}$), the Hamiltonian in the qubit rotating frame is,\n$$\n\n\\tilde{H}/\\hbar = \\sum_{n} \\frac{\\Omega_{n}(t)}{2}  \\left[ \\cos(\\gamma_n) \\hat{\\sigma}_X + \\sin(\\gamma_{n}) \\hat{\\sigma}_Y\\right]\n$$\nAssuming a constant amplitude pulse $\\Omega_{n}$ for duration $T$, the unitary transformation (the gate) due to pulse $n$ is,\n$$\n\nU_n = e^{-i\\frac{\\Omega_n T}{2} \\left[ \\cos(\\gamma_n) \\hat{\\sigma}_X + \\sin(\\gamma_n) \\hat{\\sigma}_Y\\right]}, \\label{eqn:u_rot}\n\n$$\nand so a $\\gamma_n=0 (\\frac{\\pi}{2})$ pulse is a rotation of angle $\\Omega_n T$ around the X (Y) axis of the Bloch sphere. Therefore, the AWG controls both the pulse rotation and the rotation axes. Since $\\gamma$ controls the rotation axes, intuitively we can perform a VZ-gate by adjusting $\\gamma$. More formally, we can show how this works by consider two consecutive $X$ pulses, $X_{\\theta}=e^{-i\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\hat{\\sigma}_X}$, with the phase $\\gamma$ offset by $\\phi$ between the pulses. The total unitary is,\n$$\n\ne^{-i\\frac{\\theta}{2} (\\cos(\\phi)\\hat{\\sigma}_X + \\sin(\\phi) \\hat{\\sigma}_Y)} \\cdot X_{\\theta},\n\n$$\nwhich can be expanded to,\n$$\n\ne^{i\\frac{\\phi}{2} \\hat{\\sigma}_Z} \\cdot e^{-i\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\hat{\\sigma}_X} \\cdot e^{-i\\frac{\\phi}{2}\\hat{\\sigma}_Z} \\cdot X_{\\theta},\n\n$$\nwhich equals\n$$\n\nZ_{-\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta} \\cdot Z_{\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta}.\n\n$$\nTherefore, by simply adding a phase offset in software and redefining the rotation axes for subsequent X and Y gates, we can effectively implement an arbitrary Z-gate. The additional $Z_{-\\phi}$ gate at the end is due to the fact that we are in the qubit frame of reference and so the phase offset $\\phi$ must be carried through for all subsequent gates. For example, if we follow our original sequence with a $Y_{\\theta}$ gate with the phase offset applied the gate sequence is\n$$\n\n& &  e^{-i\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\left(\\cos\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\phi\\right]\\hat{\\sigma}_X + \\sin\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\phi\\right] \\hat{\\sigma}_Y\\right)} \\cdot \\ldots \\nonumber \\\\\n& & Z_{-\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta} \\cdot Z_{\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta}, \\\\\n& = &  Z_{-\\phi} \\cdot Y_{\\theta} \\cdot Z_{\\phi} \\cdot   Z_{-\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta} \\cdot Z_{\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta}, \\\\\n& = &  Z_{-\\phi} \\cdot Y_{\\theta} \\cdot  X_{\\theta} \\cdot Z_{\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta}.\n\n$$\nThe inverse Z-gate remains, but does not change the measurement outcomes which are measured along Z.\n\nGiven that we can easily create Z-gates, we now show that any arbitrary SU(2) gate can be constructed by combining Z-gates with two $X_{\\pi/2}$ gates. In general, any SU(2) gate can be written in the form,\n$$\n\nU(\\theta,\\phi,\\lambda) = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\cos(\\theta/2) & -i e^{i\\lambda}\\sin(\\theta/2) \\\\ -ie^{i \\phi} \\sin(\\theta/2) & e^{i(\\lambda+\\phi)} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\end{array}\\right]\n\n$$\nwhich is conveniently represented (up to a global phase) as,\n$$\n\nU(\\theta,\\phi,\\lambda) = Z_{\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta} \\cdot Z_{\\lambda}.\n\n$$\nBy using the identity,\n$$\n\nX_{\\theta} = Z_{-\\pi/2} \\cdot X_{\\pi/2} \\cdot Z_{\\pi-\\theta} \\cdot X_{\\pi/2} \\cdot Z_{-\\pi/2},\n\n$$\nwe show that any SU(2) gate is\n$$\n\nU(\\theta,\\phi,\\lambda) = Z_{\\phi-\\pi/2} \\cdot X_{\\pi/2} \\cdot Z_{\\pi-\\theta} \\cdot X_{\\pi/2} \\cdot Z_{\\lambda-\\pi/2}.\n\n$$\nWe express some common gates in this notation in Table\u00a0(Table tab:gates).

This qubit is part of a two-qubit device detailed in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]; for the work here we consider it as a single independent qubit (the other qubit frequency is 5.924\u00a0GHz). A RB circuit consists of $m$ random Clifford gates with a final inverting gate so that the full circuit implements the identity operator. These Clifford gates are constructed from single qubit gate primitives which, at minimum, are $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ pulses along two independent axes. Here we compare two sets of basis pulses \u2014 the $XY_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ and $HZ$ sets. The $XY_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ set consists of the finite-duration gates $\\{X_{\\pi/2},X_{-\\pi/2},Y_{\\pi/2},Y_{-\\pi/2}\\}$ whereas the $HZ$ set consists of one finite duration gate combined with VZ-gates $\\{H,I=Z_{0},S=Z_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}},S^{\\dagger}=Z_{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}},Z_{\\pi}\\}$ where $H=Z_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\cdot X_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\cdot Z_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ is the Hadamard gate. On average, 2.25 gates from the $XY_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ set and 2.4583 gates from the $HZ$ set are required to construct a Clifford. However, for the HZ set only one of those gates per Clifford is the finite-duration Hadamard gate. Since we expect the VZ-gates to be near perfect, the HZ set should have lower error per Clifford. For this experiment each of these finite duration gates is implemented as a DRAG pulse \u2014 a pulse with a Gaussian envelope along the main rotation axis and a pulse with a derivative Gaussian envelope along the orthogonal rotation axis. The Gaussian pulse is defined as,\n$$\n\n\\Omega_{G}(t) & = & \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\Omega_0 \\frac{e^{-t^2/2\\sigma^2}-e^{-T^2/2\\sigma^2}}{1-e^{-T^2/2\\sigma^2}} &, & t \\le T \\\\ 0 & , & \\mathrm{else} \\end{array} \\right. \\label{eqn:gauss}\n\n$$\nwhere $T$ is the pulse length which is set to $T=4\\sigma$. For these experiments $T=13.33$\u00a0ns and $\\sigma=3.33$\u00a0ns with a $6.7$\u00a0ns buffer between pulses ($\\omega_{SSB}/2\\pi=-120$\u00a0MHz). The total DRAG pulse is then\n$$\n\n\\Omega(t) & = & \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\Omega_{G}(t) & , & \\gamma=0 \\\\ \\beta \\dot{\\Omega}_{G}(t) & , & \\gamma=\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\end{array} \\right., \\label{eqn:drag}\n\n$$\nwhere the DRAG parameter $\\beta$ is calibrated to optimize pulse fidelity by cancelling Stark shift errors due to off-resonance driving of higher transmon levels. In theory, the value of $\\beta$ which optimizes fidelity is $1/2\\alpha$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], however, in practice the experimentally optimized value of $\\beta$ is different since the DRAG pulse also compensates phase errors from other sources. DRAG pulses can also minimize population leakage to these higher levels, but the value of $\\beta$ for which the pulse minimizes leakage is not generically the value for which the pulse maximizes fidelity. This point will be discussed in more detail in \u00a0<ref> and is also addressed in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nSample RB data is shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:1). For the  $XY_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ set, averaging over 5 runs of 20 seeds each, we get an error per Clifford (EPC) of 5.6(1)$\\times10^{-4}$ and an error per gate in the set (EPG) of 2.48(5)$\\times10^{-4}$. For the $HZ$ set, averaging over 10 runs, the EPC is 3.0(1)$\\times10^{-4}$ and the EPG is 1.22(4)$\\times10^{-4}$. The lower EPC of the $HZ$ set is evident from the data in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:1), and confirms our expectation that the VZ-gates are significantly better than finite-length X and Y gates. To quantify the error of the VZ-gates we perform interleaved RB\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] of the $S$ gate; sample data is shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:1). Averaging over 5 runs we get an error of -1.7(1.0)$\\times10^{-5}$ with systematic errors bounds of [0,6$\\times10^{-4}$]. This is consistent with the VZ-gate having zero error and, therefore, being a perfect gate.\n\nThe RB data demonstrate the advantage of utilizing the VZ-gates in quantum algorithms. In essence, each of the curves is implementing the same RB algorithm, i.e., generate a sequence of $m$ random Cliffords that constructs the identity operator. By utilizing VZ-gates we are able to implement the algorithm with higher fidelity. Therefore, VZ-gates can lower error rates in many algorithms by optimizing the circuit to mazimize the number of Z-gates.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color Online) RB curves for the two basis sets discussed in the main text: $XY_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$  (red circles) and $HZ$ (blue squares). Interleaved RB for the $S$ gate using the $HZ$ set (green triangles). Each point is the average of 20 random seeds run in 5 separate experiments  and fit to the standard RB exponential decay curve $A r^m + B$ where $m$ is the number of Clifford gates and the average error per Clifford is $\\frac{1}{2}(1-r)$. The average error per gate is $\\frac{1}{2}(1-r^{1/N_{g}})$ where $N_g$ is the number of gates in the basis set required to implement a Clifford\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n## Correcting Errors with VZ-Gates\nBeyond their direct use in quantum circuits, VZ-gates can correct for certain pulse errors that occur during physical one and two-qubit gates without introducing new errors. For example, a VZ-gate can correct a phase error, i.e. an unwanted Z-gate, by applying the inverse Z-gate. VZ-gates can also correct most off-resonance-rotation (ORR) errors. The unitary operator due to an ORR along the $X$ axis is,\n$$\n\nU_1 & = & e^{-it  \\left[\\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\hat{\\sigma}_X + \\Delta \\hat{\\sigma}_Z \\right]}, \\\\\nU_1 & = & e^{-i\\frac{\\Omega_R t}{2} \\left[\\cos(\\lambda)\\hat{\\sigma}_X + \\sin(\\lambda)\\hat{\\sigma}_Z \\right]}, \\label{eqn:rot_err_u1}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\tan(\\lambda)=\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Omega}$ and $\\Omega_R=\\sqrt{\\Omega^2+\\Delta^2}$. If the goal is to implement the gate $X_{\\theta}$, then the question is whether there is a Z correction that can be applied to Eqn.\u00a0<ref>, i.e., is there a $\\xi$ and $\\Omega_R$ such that\n$$\n\nX_{\\theta} = Z_{\\xi} \\cdot U_1(\\Omega_R t,\\lambda) \\cdot Z_{\\xi}? \\label{eqn:rot_err_u2}\n\n$$\nIf we expand Eqn.\u00a0(<ref>) then we get the following relations,\n$$\n\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Omega_R t}{2}\\right) & = & \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)}{\\cos(\\lambda)}, \\label{eqn:omega}\\\\\n\\tan(\\xi) & = & \\sin(\\lambda) \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\Omega_R t}{2}\\right), \\label{eqn:xi}\n\n$$\nand so there is a valid correction for the ORR error when $\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)}{\\cos(\\lambda)}\\le1$. For example, if  $\\lambda=0.1$, and the desired gate is $X_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ then $\\xi \\approx 0.1$ and $\\Omega_R t= \\pi/2+0.1^2$. Graphically, an exagerrated ORR for $X_{\\pi/2}$ is illustrated on the Bloch sphere in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:2a). Starting from $|0\\rangle$ the rotation is off-axis and so the final state is not along the $Y$ axis. However, a rotation angle exists so that the state still crosses the $XY$ plane and then a final VZ-gate corrects the angle error. Physically there is no solution when the rotation is sufficiently off-resonance such that it cannot pass through the plane defined by the desired final state. For example, a detuned $\\pi$ pulse cannot be compensated since a qubit starting in state $|0\\rangle$ does not complete the rotation to $|1\\rangle$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color Online) (a) Bloch-sphere representation of an attempted $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ rotation around the $X$ axis starting in the state $|0\\rangle$ on-resonance (red/light gray) and with a detuned drive (blue/dark gray). For a suitably compensated rotation angle the detuned drive ends up in the $XY$ place, but with a finite Z-rotation error. (b) Correcting the error using a VZ-gate, i.e., axes rotation.\n\nCorrecting ORR errors is of practical importance for weakly anharmonic transmon qubits. When resonantly driving the $|0\\rangle$ to $|1\\rangle$ transition, the drive frequency is only slightly detuned from the higher level transitions such as $|1\\rangle$ to $|2\\rangle$, and so there is a strong Stark effect which shifts the frequency of the $|1\\rangle$ state during the drive. The strength of the Stark shift is inversely proportional to the detuning, and thus ORR errors increase for short gates because of Fourier broadening of the drive frequency. The standard approach to correct these errors is to utilize DRAG pulse shaping, Eqn.\u00a0(<ref>), as we did for the RB data in \u00a0<ref>. Here we show similar performance using Gaussian pulses with VZ-gates used to correct ORR errors in the form given by Eqn.\u00a0(<ref>); we refer to the combined pulse as Gaussian plus Z (GZ). In Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:2) we plot the error per gate (EPG) from $XY_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ RB for DRAG, GZ and Gaussian pulses versus the sideband frequency of the pulse. Interestingly, the EPG for the Gaussian pulse is a strong function of the sideband frequency. This can be understood to be the result of the internal filtering of the AWG. In the rotating frame of the qubit the effect of this filter on the pulse shape is similar to the DRAG pulse shape. The value and sign of $\\beta$ is a function of the sideband frequency and so for certain frequencies the pulse shape exacerbates the ORR error. When we apply the Z gate correction the calibrated phase compensates for any passive DRAG shaping. From this data we conclude that GZ pulses are a viable alternative to DRAG when optimizing pulse fidelity. GZ pulses are not sensitive to the exact shape of the pulse and, as we will discuss next, permit the utilization of pulse shaping to address different errors such as leakage.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color Online) (a) EPG for the $XY_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ set (see main text) for three different pulse implementations: Gaussian, DRAG and Gaussian plus VZ-gate (GZ) as a function of the sideband frequency. Dashed lines are theory fits assuming the coherence numbers listed in the main text, LO leakage of -65\u00a0dBm and an internal AWG filter approximately as a Gaussian filter with a bandwidth of 300\u00a0MHz[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. (b) Sample RB curves for the different pulses for a sideband frequency of 180\u00a0MHZ. The DRAG and GZ pulses are coherence limited, but the Gaussian pulse is completely dominated by unitary errors.\n\n## Leakage\nIn addition to unitary ORR errors, there is also population leakage to higher levels when driving transmon qubits. This leakage is mainly caused by frequency components in the drive at the transition frequency between the $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$ states, $\\omega_{12}=\\omega_{01}+\\alpha$. Pulse shaping, i.e., DRAG, can effectively mitigate leakage when VZ gates can be utilized to correct the unitary ORR errors (see Ref\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for similar work using DRAG and frequency chirped pulses). Here we analyze leakage versus pulse width for different pulse types: DRAG optimized for fidelity, GZ, DRAG optimized for leakage with VZ-gates to correct ORR errors (DRAGZ) and GZ with the AWG outputs externally low-pass filtered (FILTZ). For these leakage experiments we operate with a sideband frequency of -120MHz, which has two advantages. For one, leakage components at $\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}$ and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}-\\omega_{\\mathrm{SSB}}$ due to non-idealities in the mixer are detuned by at least $|\\alpha+\\omega_{\\mathrm{SSB}}|$ from $\\omega_{12}$. Second, by selecting a negative sideband we can passively filter the AWG for signals at $|\\alpha+\\omega_{\\mathrm{SSB}}|$ which could mix with $\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}$ to produce $\\omega_{12}$. For the qubit in these experiments $|\\alpha+\\omega_{\\mathrm{SSB}}|/2\\pi= 355.5$\u00a0MHz, so a LP filter between 120\u00a0MHz and 355.5\u00a0MHz can effectively filter leakage components and leave enough bandwidth to drive short pulses. Specifically, we filtering using Mini-Circuits VLF-180 (3dB frequency of 270\u00a0MHz). By filtering the AWG output we are effectively implementing a passive form of pulse shaping.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color Online) (a)Single-shot measurements of the $|0\\rangle$ (blue, left),$|1\\rangle$ (red, top-right) and $|2\\rangle$ (green, bottom-right) states in the IQ plane (1000 shots). The colored regions demonstrate the hard thresholding barriers used to bin measurements. For the RB data we use the results from this calibration to construct a POVM and invert the hard-threshold results to compensate for assignment errors. (b) Typical RB measurement for leakage. The $|2\\rangle$ state population is multiplied by 20 times for scale.  (c) Leakage rate and $|2\\rangle$ population after 2901 Clifford gates (averaged over 20 seeds) versus the DRAG parameter $\\beta$ (black). This $|2\\rangle$ population is used to calibrate $\\beta$ for the DRAGZ pulses (red/light gray).\n\nTo measure leakage we perform standard RB sequences and measure the $|0\\rangle$, $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$ populations simultaneously by hard thresholding single-shot readout signals as shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:3a) (a). A sample RB curve for the 3 states is shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:3a) (b). The EPG is measured in the standard way by fitting the $|0\\rangle$ state as described in the caption to Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:1). To measure the leakage rate per gate (LPG) we fit the $|2\\rangle$ state RB data to the same type of RB curve $A r^m + B$ and the LPG is given by the expression $p=(1-r)B/N_g$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In general there is a correction to the RB fit of the $|0\\rangle$ data due to leakage, however, when EPG$\\gg$LPG this correction is small\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. A typical calibration curve for the DRAG parameter of the DRAGZ pulses is shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:3a) (c). An efficient proxy for the LPG is the averaged $|2\\rangle$ population for a long Clifford sequence.\n\nThe LPG and EPG versus pulse width for the four pulse types is illustrated in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:3). DRAG and GZ give similar results with a general trend of lower LPG for longer pulse widths as expected due to Fourier broadening. The exception to this trend is a pronounced minima at 10\u00a0ns which is an artifact of the Gaussian truncation such that there is a zero in the pulse spectrum at $\\omega_{12}$; this effect is captured accurately in the numerics. For pulses shorter than 20ns the DRAGZ and FILTZ pulses demonstrate nearly an order-of-magnitude lower LPG. For a pulse length of 13.3\u00a0ns we measure the LPG ($\\times 10^{-6}$) for the various pulse types:  DRAGZ $3.1(6)$, FILTZ $1.4(4)$, DRAG $13(1)$ and GZ  $25(2)$. Overall, each of the pulses obtains similar EPG ($\\times 10^{-4}$): DRAGZ $1.95(3)$, FILTZ $2.80(6)$, DRAG $2.24(3)$, GZ $2.75(6)$. These are all close to the coherence limit of $1.8 \\times 10^{-4}$. While the LPG sets a lower bound on the EPG, significant gains in coherence will be required to reach that bound. For pulses greater than 20\u00a0ns the LPG rises; this is observed in theory calculations which include thermal relaxation to an effective system temperature of $T=46$\u00a0mK. When the system is at a finite temperature there is incoherent population transfer between levels $m$ and $n$ such that in equilibrium the ratio of populations is $e^{-(E_n-E_m)/k_B T}$. Therefore, finite-temperature heating sets a lower bound on the leakage, which is also the conclusion of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Understanding why the qubit is higher temperature than the cryostat ($10-15$\u00a0mK) and how to reduce that temperature is an active area of investigation.\n\nOverall, replacing DRAG with GZ pulses does not affect the EPG and instead it frees up DRAG pulse shaping to specifically minimize leakage using DRAGZ pulses. The lowest LPG is obtained with FILTZ, albeit with similar performance to DRAGZ and with the caveat that it only works for specific sideband frequencies. Ultimately, leakage is not a limiting factor for single qubit gate performance, however, leakage can have detrimental effects on error correction protocols\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color Online) (a) Leakage per gate versus pulse length for DRAG, GZ, DRAGZ and FILTZ. Lines are theory curves assuming the coherences mentioned in the main text, a temperature of 46\u00a0mK, LO leakage of -65\u00a0dBm and an AWG filter bandwidth of 300\u00a0MHz (100\u00a0MHz for FILTZ). DRAGZ points were only taken to a pulse length of 20\u00a0ns; beyond this point calibration of the DRAG parameter (to minimize leakage) was not reliable because the leakage signal was below the noise floor. (b) EPG from the same measurement. The black dashed line is a theory curve for a perfect DRAG pulse (i.e. no mixer or AWG effects) and is representative of the coherence limited error.\n\n## The VZ-Gate in Multiqubit Systems\nEmploying VZ-gates in multiqubit systems depends on the specific implementation of the two-qubit gate interaction. For example, consider a two-qubit Hamiltonian with the interaction term $\\hat{\\sigma}^{(1)}_Z \\otimes \\hat{\\sigma}^{(2)}_X$,\n$$\n\nH/\\hbar & = &  - \\frac{\\omega_{1}}{2} \\hat{\\sigma}^{(1)}_Z  - \\frac{\\omega_{2}}{2} \\hat{\\sigma}^{(2)}_Z +  g \\hat{\\sigma}^{(1)}_Z \\otimes \\hat{\\sigma}^{(2)}_X. \\label{eqn:int1}\n\n$$\nIn the rotating frame of the single-qubit drives, $U_{\\mathrm{rot}} = e^{-i \\left( \\frac{\\omega_{1}t + \\phi_1}{2} \\hat{\\sigma}^{(1)}_Z  + \\frac{\\omega_{2}t + \\phi_2}{2} \\hat{\\sigma}^{(2)}_Z \\right)}$,\n$$\n\n\\tilde{H}/\\hbar & = &  g \\hat{\\sigma}^{(1)}_Z \\otimes \\left( \\cos(\\omega_2 t + \\phi_2) \\hat{\\sigma}^{(2)}_X \\right. \\nonumber \\\\\n& & \\left. + \\sin(\\omega_2 t + \\phi_2)\\hat{\\sigma}^{(2)}_Y \\right), \\label{eqn:int2}\n\n$$\nand so the single-qubit drive phase is imprinted on the two-qubit interaction if the interaction term is $\\hat{\\sigma}_X$ or $\\hat{\\sigma}_Y$. When we apply a VZ-gate, the phase update to the single-qubit drive will affect subsequent two-qubit interactions; how to manage this issue is dependent on the specific implementation of that interaction.\n\nFor microwave-activated gates the phase update is straightforward. Here we will give two examples for the cross-resonance gate and the parametric iSWAP gate. The cross-resonance (CR) gate (see e.g. Ref\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]) interaction is the example considered in Eqn.\u00a0(<ref>). To turn on the CR interaction the $ZX$ term is modulated at $\\omega_2$ with a separate drive. The CR rotation angle is defined with respect to the the phase $\\phi_2$ as shown in Eqn.\u00a0(<ref>). When a VZ-gate is applied to qubit 2 the phase of the CR drive must be updated accordingly. For the iSWAP gate (see e.g. Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]), an $XX+YY$ term is activated by modulating at the difference frequency $\\omega_1-\\omega_2$. The phase of this iSWAP drive is matched to the difference of the single-qubit drive phases $\\phi_1-\\phi_2$. Therefore, the VZ-gate phase is applied to the iSWAP drive with a different sign for qubits 1 and 2.\n\nFor flux-tunable qubits, i.e., where the qubit frequencies are dynamically tuned to go to an interaction resonance, compatibility with the VZ-gate is more difficult. In these systems there are time dependent single-qubit $\\sigma_Z$ terms in Eqn.\u00a0(<ref>) which do not necessarily commute with the interaction. Therefore VZ-gates before the interaction necessitate also updating the $\\sigma_Z$ dynamics. However, if the interaction is $ZZ$ (see e.g. Refs\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]), then these single-qubit $Z$ terms commute through and can be compensated by a subsequent VZ-gate.\n\n## Conclusions\nIn conclusion, we investigate a method to implement a near-perfect Z-gate by controlling the phase of the microwave drive used for $X$ and $Y$ rotations \u2013 the virtual Z-gate (VZ-gate). This gate can improve the fidelity of circuits with a large number of single-qubit gates, can be used to efficiently correct typical gate errors and be used to implement arbitrary SU(2) gates given a calibrated $X_{\\pi/2}$ gate. In this work we used VZ-gates to correct single-qubit rotation errors, but the gate should have wide applicability for improving two-qubit gates. In particular, as the number of qubits increases, crosstalk Z-errors will be ubiquitous. The VZ-gate is a low-overhead method for correcting these type of errors. By using pulse shaping techniques to minimize leakage and VZ gates to correct rotation errors we demonstrated a hybrid pulse with leakage limited by the qubit temperature and gate fidelity limited by coherence. Further improvements in leakage are limited by the qubit temperature.\n\nWe acknowledge Firat Solgun, George Keefe and Markus Brink for the simulation, layout and fabrication of devices.

We use active depletion of post-measurement photons and optimal\nintegration weight functions on two quadratures to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of non-steady-state homodyne measurement.  We derive analytically and demonstrate\nexperimentally that the method robustly extracts the quantum efficiency for\narbitrary readout conditions in the linear regime.  We use the proven method to\noptimally bias a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier and to quantify the\ndifferent noise contributions in the readout amplification chain.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nThe three-step method for extracting the quantum\nefficiency with active photon depletion.\n(a) Calibration of the optimal weight functions for the in-phase quadrature I and out-of-phase quadrature Q for active depletion (passive depletion is shown for reference).\nThe measurement pulse consists of a ramp-up of duration $\\tauup=600~\\ns$ and two $200~\\ns$ depletion segments\n($\\taud=400~\\ns$).\nThe weight functions show the dynamics of the information gain during readout and the\neffect of the active photon depletion (grey area).\nDashed black curves are extracted from a linear model (see supplementary material).\n(b) Study of dephasing under variable-strength weak measurement.\nObserved Ramsey fringes at from left to right $\\eps=0.0,0.12,0.25$ V.\nThe measurement pulse, globally scaled with $\\eps$, is embedded in a fixed-length\n($\\tauint=1100~\\ns$) Ramsey sequence with final strong fixed-amplitude\nmeasurement.\nThe azimuthal angle $\\varphi$ of the final $\\pi/2$ rotation is\nswept from 0 to $4\\pi$ to discern deterministic phase shifts and dephasing.\nThe coherence $\\left|\\rhozeroone\\right|$ is extracted by fitting each fringe with\nthe form\n$\\sigmaz=2\\left|\\rhozeroone\\right|\\cos\\left(\\varphi+\\varphi_0\\right)$.\n(c) Study of signal-to-noise ratio of variable-strength weak measurement.\nHistograms of $2^{15}$ shots at from left to right: $\\eps=0.0,0.12,0.25$ V.\nThe qubit is prepared in $\\ket{0}$ without (blue) and in $\\ket{1}$ with a $\\pi$ pulse (red).\nEach measurement record is integrated in real time with the weight functions of (a) during\n$\\tauint=1100~\\ns$ to obtain $\\Vint$. Each histogram (markers) is fitted with the sum of\ntwo Gaussian functions (solid lines), whose individual components are indicated by the dashed lines.

From the best fits we extract $\\etae = a^2\n\\sigma^2/2=0.165 \\pm 0.002$.\n\nMany protocols in quantum information processing, like quantum error correction\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], require rapid interleaving of qubit gates and measurements.\nThese measurements are ideally nondemolition, fast, and high fidelity.\nIn circuit QED\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], a leading platform for quantum computing, nondemolition readout is routinely achieved by off-resonantly coupling a qubit to a resonator.\nThe qubit-state-dependent dispersive shift of the resonator frequency is inferred by measuring the resonator response to an interrogating pulse using homodyne detection.\nA key element setting the speed and fidelity of dispersive readout is the quantum efficiency\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which quantifies how the signal-to-noise ratio is degraded with respect to the limit imposed by quantum vacuum fluctuations.\n\nIn recent years, the use of superconducting parametric amplifiers\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] as the front end of the readout amplification chain has boosted the quantum efficiency towards unity, leading to readout infidelity on the order of one percent\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] in individual qubits.\nMost recently,  the development of traveling-wave parametric amplifiers\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (TWPAs) has extended the amplification bandwidth from tens of MHz to several GHz and with sufficient dynamic range to readout tens of qubits.\nFor characterization and optimization of the amplification chain, the ability to robustly determine the quantum efficiency is an important benchmark.\n\nA common method for quantifying the quantum efficiency $\\eta$ that does not rely on calibrated noise sources compares the information obtained in a weak qubit measurement (expressed by the signal-to-noise-ratio SNR) to the dephasing of the qubit (expressed by the decay of the off-diagonal elements of the qubit density matrix)\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], $\\eta=\\frac{\\SNR^2}{4\\gammam}$, with $\\mathrm{e}^{-\\gammam} =\\frac{\\left|\\rhozeroone(T)\\right|}{\\left|\\rhozeroone(0)\\right|}$, where $T$ is the measurement duration.\nPrevious experimental work\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] has been restricted to fast resonators driven under specific symmetry conditions such that information is contained in only one quadrature of the output field and in steady state.\nTo allow in-situ calibration of $\\eta$ in multi-qubit devices under development\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], a method is desirable that does not rely on either of these conditions.\n\nIn this Letter, we present and demonstrate a general three-step method for extracting the quantum efficiency of linear dispersive readout in cQED.\nOur method disposes with previous requirements in both the dynamics and the phase space trajectory of the resonator field, while requiring two easily met conditions:\nthe depletion of resonator photons post measurement\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and the ability to perform weighted integration of both quadratures of the output field\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nWe experimentally test the method on a qubit-resonator pair with a Josephson TWPA (JTWPA)\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] at the front end of the amplification chain.\nTo prove the generality of the method, we extract a consistent value of $\\eta$ for different readout drive frequencies and drive envelopes.\nFinally, we use the method to optimally bias the JTWPA and to quantify the different noise contributions in the readout amplification chain.\n\nWe first derive the method, obtaining experimental boundary conditions.\nFor a measurement in the linear dispersive regime of cQED, the internal field $\\alpha(t)$ of the readout resonator, driven by a pulse with envelope $\\eps f(t)$ and detuned by $\\Delta$ from the resonator center frequency, is described by\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n$$\n\n\\frac{\\partial\\alpha_{\\ket{0}/\\ket{1}}}{\\partial t} = -i \\eps\nf(t)-i(\\Delta\\pm\\chi)\\alpha(t)-\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\alpha(t), \\label{eq:cavity-eom}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the resonator linewidth and $2\\chi$ is the dispersive shift.\nThe upper (lower) sign has to be chosen for the qubit in the ground $\\ket{0}$\n[excited $\\ket{1}$] state.\nWe study the evolution of the SNR and the measurement-induced dephasing as a function of the drive amplitude $\\eps$, while keeping $T$ constant. We find that the SNR scales linearly, $\\SNR=a\\eps$, and that coherence elements exhibit a Gaussian dependence, $\\left|\\rhozeroone(T,\\eps)\\right|=\n\\left|\\rhozeroone(T,0)\\right| \\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{\\eps^2}{2\\sigmam^2}}$, with $a$ and $\\sigmam$ dependent on $\\kappa$, $\\chi$, $\\Delta$, and $f(t)$.\nFurthermore, we find (Supplementary material)\n$$\n\n\\eta=\\frac{\\SNR^2}{4\\gammam}=\\frac{\\sigmam^2a^2}{2}\n\\label{eq:main-eta-formula}\n\n$$\nprovided two conditions are met. The conditions are: i) optimal integration functions\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] are used to optimally extract information from both quadratures, and ii) the intra-resonator field vanishes at the beginning and end; i.e., photons are depleted from the resonator post-measurement.\n\nTo meet these conditions, we introduce a three-step experimental method.\nFirst, tuneup active photon depletion (or depletion by waiting) and calibration of the optimal integration weights.\nSecond, obtain the measurement-induced dephasing of variable-strength weak measurement by including the pulse within a Ramsey sequence.\nThird, measure the SNR of variable-strength weak measurement from single-shot readout histograms.\n\nWe test the method on a cQED test chip containing seven transmon qubits with dedicated readout resonators, each coupled to one of two feedlines (see supplementary material).\nWe present data for one qubit-resonator pair, but have verified the method with other pairs in this and other devices.\nThe qubit is operated at its flux-insensitive point with a qubit frequency $f_\\mathrm{q}=5.070~\\GHz$, where the measured energy relaxation and echo dephasing times are $T_1=15~\\us$ and $T_\\mathrm{2,echo}=26~\\us$, respectively.\nThe resonator has a low-power fundamental at $f_\\mathrm{r,\\ket{0}}=7.852400~\\GHz$ ($f_\\mathrm{r,\\ket{1}}=f_\\mathrm{r,\\ket{0}}+\\chi/\\pi=7.852295~\\GHz$) for qubit in $\\ket{0}$ ($\\ket{1}$), with linewidth $\\kappa/2\\pi=1.4~\\MHz$.\nThe readout pulse generation and readout signal integration are performed by single-sideband mixing.\nPulse-envelope generation, demodulation and signal processing are performed by a Zurich Instruments UHFLI-QC with 2 AWG channels and 2 ADC channels running at $1.8~\\Gsps$ with $14-$ and $12-$bit resolution, respectively.\n\nIn the first step, we tune up the depletion steps and calibrate the optimal integration weights.\nWe use a measurement ramp-up pulse of duration $\\tauup=600~\\ns$, followed by a photon-depletion counter pulse\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] consisting of two steps of $200~\\ns$ duration each, for a total depletion time $\\taud=400~\\ns$.\nTo successfully deplete without relying on symmetries that are specific to a readout frequency at the midpoint between ground and excited state resonances (i.e., $\\Delta=0$), we vary 4 parameters of the depletion steps (details provided in the supplementary material).\nFrom the averaged transients of the finally obtained measurement pulse, we extract the optimal integration weights given by\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] the difference between the averaged transients for $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:method)(a)].\nThe success of the active depletion is evidenced by the nulling at the end of $\\taud$.\nIn this initial example, we connect to previous work by setting $\\Delta=0$, leaving all measurement information in one quadrature.\n\nWe next use the tuned readout to study its measurement-induced dephasing and SNR to finally extract $\\eta$.\nWe measure the dephasing by including the measurement-and-depletion pulse in a Ramsey sequence and varying its amplitude, $\\eps$ [Figs.\u00a0(Figure fig:method)(b)].\nBy varying the azimuthal angle of the second qubit pulse, we allow distinguishing dephasing from deterministic phase shifts and extract $\\left|\\rhozeroone\\right|$ from the amplitude of the fitted Ramsey fringes.\nThe $\\SNR$ at various $\\eps$ is extracted from single-shot readout experiments preparing the qubit in $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ [Figs.\u00a0(Figure fig:method)(c)].\nWe use double Gaussian fits in both cases, neglecting measurement results in the spurious Gaussians to reduce corruption by imperfect state preparation and residual qubit excitation and relaxation.\nAs expected, as a function of $\\eps$, $\\left|\\rhozeroone\\right|$ decreases following a Gaussian form and the $\\SNR$ increases linearly [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:method)(d)].\nThe best fits to both dependencies give $\\etae=0.165\\pm 0.002$.\nNote that both dephasing and SNR measurements include ramp-up, depletion and an additional $\\taubuffer=100~\\ns$, making the total measurement window $\\tauint=\\tauup+\\taud+\\taubuffer=1100~\\ns$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Pulsed feedline transmission near the low-power resonator fundamentals.

(b) Quantum efficiency extraction as a\nfunction of $\\Delta$ using the pulse timings and three-step method of\nFig.\u00a0(Figure fig:method).

(e) Plots of the best-fit $\\etapre$, $\\etaTWPAd(\\GTWPA)$\nand $\\etapost(\\GTWPA)$. The stars (b, d) and vertical dashed lines (d, e)\nindicate ($\\Ppump=-71.0~\\dBm$, $\\fpump=8.13~\\GHz$, $\\eta=0.1670$,\n$\\GTWPA=21.6~\\dB$) used throughout the experiment.\n\nWe next demonstrate the generality of the method by extracting $\\eta$ as a function of the readout drive frequency.  We repeat the method at fifteen readout drive detunings over a range of $2.8~\\MHz\\sim\\kappa/\\pi\\sim14 \\chi/\\pi$ around $\\Delta=0$ [Figs.\u00a0(Figure fig:detuning)(a,b)].\nFurthermore, we compare the effect of using optimal weight functions versus square weight functions, and the effect of using active versus passive photon depletion.\nThe square weight functions correspond to a single point in phase space during $\\tauint$, with unit amplitude and an optimized phase maximizing SNR.\nWe satisfy the zero-photon field condition by depleting the photons actively with $\\tauint=1100~\\ns$ (as in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:method)) or passively by waiting with $\\tauint=2100~\\ns$.\nWhen information is extracted from both quadratures using optimal weight functions, we measure an average $\\etae=0.167$ with $0.004$ standard deviation.\nThe extracted optimal integration functions in the time domain [Figs.\u00a0(Figure fig:detuning)(c,d)] show how the resonator returns to the vacuum for both active and passive depletion.\nSquare weight functions are not able to track the measurement dynamics in the time domain (even at $\\Delta=0$), leading to a reduction in $\\etae$.\nFigures\u00a0(Figure fig:detuning)(e,f) show the weight functions in phase space.\nThe opening of the trajectories with detuning illustrates the rotating optimal measurement axis during measurement and leads to a further reduction of increase of $\\etae$ when square weight functions are used.\nThe dynamics and the $\\etae$ dependence on $\\Delta$ are excellently described by the linear model, which uses eq.\u00a0<ref>, the separately calibrated $\\kappa$ and $\\chi$ [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:detuning)(a)] and $\\eta=0.1670$ (details in the supplementary material).\nFurthermore, the matching of the dynamics and depletion pulse parameters (see supplementary material) when using active photon depletion confirm the numerical optimization techniques.\n\nTo further test the robustness of the method to arbitrary pulse envelopes, we have used a measurement-and-depletion pulse envelope $f(t)$ resembling a typical Dutch skyline.\nThe pulse envelope outlines five canal houses, of which the first three ramp up the resonator and the latter two are used as the tunable depletion steps. Completing the three steps, we extract (see supplementary material) $\\etae=0.167\\pm0.005$, matching our previous value to within error.\n\nWe use the proven method to optimally bias the JTWPA and to quantify the different noise contributions in the readout chain.\nTo this end, we map $\\etae$ as a function of pump power and frequency, just below the dispersive feature of the JTWPA, finding the maximum $\\etae=0.1670$ at ($\\Ppump=-71.0~\\dBm$, $\\fpump=8.13~\\GHz$) [Figs.\u00a0(Figure fig:TWPA)(a-c)].\nWe next compare the obtained $\\etae$ at the optimal bias frequency to independent low-power measurements of the JTWPA gain $\\GTWPA$ we find $\\GTWPA=21.6~\\dB$ at the optimal bias point.\nWe fit this parametric plot with a three-stage model, with noise contributions before, in and after the JTWPA, $\\eta(\\GTWPA)=\\etapre \\times \\etaTWPAd(\\GTWPA) \\times \\etapost(\\GTWPA)$.\nThe parameter $\\etapre$ captures losses in the device and the microwave network between the device and the JTWPA and is therefore independent of $\\GTWPA$.\nThe JTWPA has a distributed loss along the amplifying transmission line, which is modeled as an array of interleaved sections with quantum-limited amplification and sections with attenuation adding up to the total insertion loss of the JTWPA (as in Ref.\u00a0Macklin15).\nFinally, the post-JTWPA amplification chain is modeled with a fixed noise temperature, whose relative noise contribution diminishes as $\\GTWPA$ is increased.\nThe best fit [Figs.\u00a0(Figure fig:TWPA)(d,e)] gives $\\etapre=0.22$, consistent with $50\\%$ photon loss due to symmetric coupling of the resonator to the feedline input and output, an attenuation of the microwave network between device and JTWPA of $2~\\dB$ and residual loss in the JTWPA of $27\\%$. We fit a distributed insertion loss of the JTWPA of $4.6~\\dB$, closely matching the separate calibration of $4.2~\\dB$ [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:TWPA)(c)].\nFinally, we fit a noise temperature of $2.6$ K, close to the HEMT amplifier's factory specification of $2.2$ K.\n\nWe identify room for improving $\\etae$ to $\\sim0.5$ by implementing Purcell filters with asymmetric coupling\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (primarily to the output line) and decreasing the insertion loss in the microwave network, by optimizing the setup for shorter and superconducting cabling between device and JTWPA.\n\nIn conclusion, we have presented and demonstrated a general three-step method for extracting the quantum efficiency of linear dispersive qubit readout in cQED.\nWe have derived analytically and demonstrated experimentally that the method robustly extracts the quantum efficiency for arbitrary readout conditions in the linear regime.\nThis method will be used as a tool for readout performance characterization and optimization.\n\nSee supplementary material for a description of the linear model, the derivation of Eq.\u00a0(2), a description of the depletion tuneup and additional figures.\n\nWe thank W.\u00a0D.\u00a0Oliver for providing the JTWPA, N.\u00a0K.\u00a0Langford for experimental contributions, M.\u00a0A.\u00a0Rol for software contributions, and C.\u00a0Dickel and F.\u00a0Luthi for discussions.

In Sec.~\\ref{sec:basic-expr}, we present details of the linear model we use to describe the resonator and qubit dynamics during linear dispersive readout. In Sec.~\\ref{sec:modelling-fig2}, we describe how we evaluated these expressions to obtain the dashed lines in Fig.~2 of the main text, to which experimental results are compared.\nIn Sec.~\\ref{sec:eq2}, we show that Eq.~(2) follows from the linear model.\nSec.~\\ref{sec:cost} provides the cost function used for the optimization of depletion pulses. Figure~\\ref{fig:detuning_supplement} supplies the  optimized depletion pulse parameters as a function of $\u0394$ and the SNR and coherence as a function of the drive amplitude and $\u0394$. Figure~\\ref{fig:amsterdam} shows the extraction of $$ for an alternative pulse shape. Finally, Fig.~\\ref{fig:setup} provides a full wiring diagram and a photograph of the device.\n\n\\section{Modeling of resonator dynamics and measurement signal}\n\\label{sec:basic-expr}\n\nIn this section, we give the expressions that model the resonator dynamics and measured signal in the linear dispersive regime.\n\nIn general, the measured homodyne signal consists of in-phase (I) and in-quadrature (Q) components, given by~\\cite{FriskKockum12e}\n__MATH_BLOCK_2__\nHere, $V_0$ is an irrelevant gain factor and $n_I$, $n_Q$ are continuous, independent Gaussian white noise terms with unit variance,\n$\u27e8n_j(t)n_k(t')\u27e9=\u03b4_jk\u03b4(t-t')$, while the internal resonator field\n$\u03b1_|i\u27e9$\nfollows Eq.~(1) for $i\u2208{0,1}$. In the shunt resonator arrangement used on the device for this work, the measured signal also includes an additional term describing the directly transmitted part of the measurement pulse. We omitted this term here, as it is independent of the qubit state, and thus is irrelevant for the following, as we will exclusively encounter the signal difference $- $.\n\nFor state discrimination, the homodyne signals are each multiplied with weight functions, given by the difference of the averaged signals, then\nsummed and integrated over the measurement window of duration $T$:\n__MATH_BLOCK_3__\nThe optimal weight functions~\\cite{Ryan15e,Magesan15e} are given by the difference of the average signal\n__MATH_BLOCK_4__\nAs an alternative to optimal weight functions, often constant weight functions are used\n__MATH_BLOCK_5__\nwhere the demodulation phase $\u03d5_w$ is usually chosen as to maximize the $$ (see below).\n\nWe define the signal $S$  as the absolute separation between the average $$ for $|1\u27e9$ and $|0\u27e9$. In turn, we define the noise $N$ as the standard deviation of $V_int, |i\u27e9$, which is independent of $|i\u27e9$.

Experimentally, the dephasing can be quantified by including the measurement pulse in a Ramsey sequence.

The scale factor $V_0$ was chosen to best represent the experimental data.\n\nIn order to model the data presented in panel (b), we further inserted the $\u03b1_|i\u27e9$ into Eqs.~\\eqref{eq:def-s-and-n} and \\eqref{eq:def-gammam}, and finally into\nEq.~(2) to obtain $$. This step is performed for both optimal weights and constant weights, Eqs.~\\eqref{eq:def-wopt}~and~\\eqref{eq:def-w-square}.\nAs shown in Fig.~2, the result depends on pulse shape and $\u0394$ when using square weights, but does not when using optimal weights. The value for $\u03b7$ in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:def-viq} is chosen as the average of $$ for optimal weight functions, $=0.167$.\n\n\\section{Derivation of equation 2}\n\\label{sec:eq2}\n\nWith the definitions of the previous sections, we now show that Eq.~(2) holds for arbitrary pulses and resonator parameters if optimal weight functions are used,\nso that $$ in Fig.~2 indeed coincides with $\u03b7$ in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:def-viq}.\n\nUsing optimal weight functions, we can evaluate Eq.~\\eqref{eq:def-s-and-n} in terms of $\u03b1_|i\u27e9$  by inserting Eqs.~\\eqref{eq:def-wopt} and \\eqref{eq:def-viq},\nobtaining for the signal $S$:\n\\begin{align*}\nS_\\mathrm{opt} = 2\\kappa \\eta V_0^2 \\int_0^T \\left| \\alpha_\\mathrm{\\ket{1}}-\\alpha_\\mathrm{\\ket{0}} \\right| ^2 dt.\n\\end{align*}\nFor the noise $N$, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\nN^2_\\mathrm{opt} & = V_0^2\\Bigg\\langle\\int_0^T \\Big(w_\\mathrm{I} n_\\mathrm{I} + w_\\mathrm{Q} n_\\mathrm{Q}\\Big)^2 dt\\Bigg\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\\n&= 2 \\kappa \\eta V_0^4 \\int_0^T \\left|\n\\alpha_\\mathrm{\\ket{1}}-\\alpha_\\mathrm{\\ket{0}} \\right| ^2 dt,\n\\end{align*}\nwhere we used the white noise property of $n_I, Q(t)$.\n\nThe SNR is then given by\n__MATH_BLOCK_8__\nNote that the $\u03b1_|i\u27e9$ scale linearly with the amplitude $$ due to the linearity of Eq.~(1), so that the SNR scales linearly with $$ as well.\n\nWe now show that the $$ and SNR are related by Eq.~(2), independent of resonator and pulse parameters.\nFor that, we need to make use of constraint (ii), namely that the resonator fields $\u03b1_|i\u27e9$\nvanish at the beginning and end of the integration window. We then can write\n\\begin{align*}\n0 &= \\left[ \\left|\\alphag - \\alphae \\right|^2 \\right]_0^T \\\\\n&=\\int_0^T \\partial_t \\left| \\alphag - \\alphae \\right|^2 dt \\\\\n& = 2\\int_0^T \\mathrm{Re}\\left( (\\alphae^* - \\alphag^*)\\partial_t (\\alphae - \\alphag)\\right)dt,\n\\end{align*}\nwhere the first equality is ensured by requirement (ii), and the second equality follows from rewriting as the integral of a differential.\n\nWe insert the differential equation Eq.~(1) into this expression, obtaining\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\mathrm{Re}\\int_0^T \\left(\\alphae^* - \\alphag^*\\right) \\times  \\\\\n&\\Bigg(\\left(-i\\Delta - \\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\right) \\left(\\alphae - \\alphag\\right)\n- i \\chi \\left(\\alphae + \\alphag\\right)\\Bigg) dt = 0.\n\\end{align*}\nIsolating the $\u03ba$ term and dropping purely imaginary $\u0394$ and $\u03c7$ terms, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\int_0^T \\left| \\alphae - \\alphag \\right|^2 dt \\\\\n= &  - \\mathrm{Re} \\left( i\\chi \\int_0^T \\left( \\alphae + \\alphag\\right) (\\alphae^* - \\alphag^*) dt \\right) \\\\\n= &  - \\mathrm{Re}\\left( i \\chi \\int_0^T \\left(|\\alphae|^2 - |\\alphag|^2\n+ 2 i \\mathrm{Im} (\\alphag \\alphae^*)\\right) dt\\right)\\\\\n= & 2 \\chi \\int_0^T \\mathrm{Im} (\\alphag \\alphae^*) dt.\n\\end{align*}\nComparing the first and last line with Eqs.~\\eqref{eq:snr-opt} and \\eqref{eq:def-gammam}, respectively, this equality shows indeed that the SNR,\nwhen defined with optimal integration weights, and the measurement-induced dephasing\n$$ are related by Eq.~(2), independent of the resonator parameters $\u03ba$, $\u03c7$, and the functional form $f(t)$ of the drive.\n\n\\section{Depletion tuneup}\n\\label{sec:cost}\nHere, we provide details on the depletion tuneup. The depletion is tuned by optimizing the amplitude and phase of both depletion steps (Fig.~\\ref{fig:detuning_supplement}) using the Nelder-Mead algorithm with a cost function that penalizes non-zero averaged transients for both $|0\u27e9$ and $|1\u27e9$ during a $=200\u00a0$ time window after the depletion. The transients are obtained by preparing the qubit in $|0\u27e9$ ($|1\u27e9$) and averaging\nthe time-domain homodyne voltages $V_I, |0\u27e9$ and $V_Q, |0\u27e9$ ($V_I, |1\u27e9$ and $V_Q, |1\u27e9$) of the transmitted measurement pulse for $2^15$ repetitions. The cost function consists of four different terms. The first two null the transients in both quadratures post-depletion. The last two additionally penalize the difference between the transients for $|0\u27e9$ and $|1\u27e9$ with a tunable factor $d$. In the experiment, we found reliable convergence of the depletion tuneup for $d=10$.\n\n\\begin{align*}\ncost &= \\sqrt{\\int_{\\tauup+\\taud}^{\\tauup+\\taud+\\taucost}\\langle{V_{\\mathrm{I},\\ket{0}}}(t)\\rangle^2+\\langle{V_{\\mathrm{Q},\\ket{0}}}(t)\\rangle^2 dt}\\\\\n&+ \\sqrt{\\int_{\\tauup+\\taud}^{\\tauup+\\taud+\\taucost}\\langle {V_{\\mathrm{I},\\ket{1}}}(t)\\rangle^2+\\langle{V_{\\mathrm{Q},\\ket{1}}}(t)\\rangle^2 dt}\\\\\n&+d \\sqrt{\\int_{\\tauup+\\taud}^{\\tauup+\\taud+\\taucost} \\langle {V_{\\mathrm{I},\\ket{1}}}(t)-{V_{\\mathrm{I},\\ket{0}}}(t)\\rangle^2 dt}\\\\\n&+ d \\sqrt{\\int_{\\tauup+\\taud}^{\\tauup+\\taud+\\taucost}\\langle {V_{\\mathrm{Q},\\ket{1}}}(t)-{V_{\\mathrm{Q},\\ket{0}}}(t)\\rangle^2 dt}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn Figures~\\ref{fig:detuning_supplement}(b,c), we show the obtained depletion pulse\nparameters for different values of $\u0394$. As a comparison, we show the\nparameters that are predicted by numerically integrating Eq.~(1), with resonator parameters extracted from Fig.~2(a), and numerically finding the depletion pulse parameters that lead to\n$\u03b1_|0, 1\u27e9(T) = 0$.\n\n%merlin.mbs aipnum4-1.bst 2010-07-25 4.21a (PWD, AO, DPC) hacked\n%Control: key (0)\n%Control: author (8) initials jnrlst\n%Control: editor formatted (1) identically to author\n%Control: production of article title (-1) disabled\n%Control: page (0) single\n%Control: year (1) truncated\n%Control: production of eprint (0) enabled\n\\begin{thebibliography}{4}%\n\\makeatletter\n\\providecommand \\@ifxundefined [1]{%\n\\@ifx{#1\\undefined}\n}%\n\\providecommand \\@ifnum [1]{%\n\\ifnum #1\\expandafter \\@firstoftwo\n\\else \\expandafter \\@secondoftwo\n\\fi\n}%\n\\providecommand \\@ifx [1]{%\n\\ifx #1\\expandafter \\@firstoftwo\n\\else \\expandafter \\@secondoftwo\n\\fi\n}%\n\\providecommand \\natexlab [1]{#1}%\n\\providecommand \\enquote  [1]{``#1''}%\n\\providecommand \\bibnamefont  [1]{#1}%\n\\providecommand \\bibfnamefont [1]{#1}%\n\\providecommand \\citenamefont [1]{#1}%\n\\providecommand \\href@noop [0]{\\@secondoftwo}%\n\\providecommand \\href [0]{\\begingroup \\@sanitize@url \\@href}%\n\\providecommand \\@href[1]{\\@@startlink{#1}\\@@href}%\n\\providecommand \\@@href[1]{\\endgroup#1\\@@endlink}%\n\\providecommand \\@sanitize@url [0]{\\catcode `\\\\12\\catcode `\\$12`&12`#12`1\u03022`_12`\nstartlink[1]\nendlink[0]\n\nrl [1]href #1\n\n@bib@innerbibempty\n\n[Frisk\u00a0Kockum, Tornberg, and  Johansson(2012)]FriskKockum12e\nauthor author A.\u00a0Frisk\u00a0Kockum, author L.\u00a0Tornberg,  and author G.\u00a0Johansson, https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevA.85.052318\njournal journal Phys.
