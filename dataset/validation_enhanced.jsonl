The LO is a single tone microwave source that outputs a constant signal $\\cos(\\omega_{LO}t)$. The AWG outputs a programmable series of discrete voltage points at a specific sample rate, e.g., for the Tektronix 5014 used in these experiments that sample rate is 1.2GSa/s (0.833ns between points). These points are internally filtered so that the output is a smooth waveform. Including this filter ($F$), the AWG output is\n$$\n\nV(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} d\\tau F(t-\\tau) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} V_n \\sqcap(n-\\tau/T) \\label{eqn:awgfilt}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\{V_n\\}$ is the set of AWG voltages, $T$ is the AWG period and $\\sqcap(x)$ is a pulse function defined as $\\sqcap(x)=\\{1,0\\}$ conditioned on $|x|\\le 1/2$. The IQ mixer multiplies the I and Q channels with the LO such that,\n$$\n\nV_{RF}(t) & = & V_{I}(t)\\cos(\\omega_{LO}t)  \\nonumber \\\\\n& & + V_{Q}(t)[1+\\epsilon_Q]\\sin(\\omega_{LO}t+\\epsilon_{\\phi}) \\nonumber \\\\\n& & + \\epsilon_{LO}\\cos(\\omega_{LO} t)\n\n$$\nwhere the $\\epsilon$ terms are non-ideal errors common to IQ mixers.\n\nThe AWG voltages are used to shape the pulse and shift the pulse frequency to resonance via single sideband (SSB) modulation. If the desired pulse envelope is $\\Omega(t)$ and the drive frequency is $\\omega_{D}=\\omega_{LO}+\\omega_{SSB}$ then the output of an ideal AWG (ignoring the pixelation and filtering described by Eqn.\u00a0<ref>) is,\n$$\n\nV_{I}(t) & = & \\Omega(t) \\cos(\\omega_{SSB} t - \\gamma), \\\\\nV_{Q}(t) & = & -\\Omega(t) \\sin(\\omega_{SSB} t - \\gamma).\n\n$$\nThese AWG signals, when applied to the inputs of an ideal mixer, output the desired drive pulse\n$$\n\nV_{RF}(t) & = & \\Omega(t) \\cos(\\omega_{D} t - \\gamma). \\label{eqn:pulse_drive}\n\n$$\nA series of $n$ shaped microwave pulses driving an anharmonic oscillator (a good description of a transmon qubit) is described by the Hamiltonian (in the lab frame),\n$$\n\nH/\\hbar & = & \\sum_{n} \\Omega_{n}(t) \\cos(\\omega_D t +\\gamma_n) (\\hat{a}+\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}) + \\omega_{01} \\hat{n} \\nonumber \\\\\n& & + \\frac{\\alpha}{2} (\\hat{n}-1)\\hat{n},\n\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{a}(\\hat{a}^{\\dagger})$ is the annihilation (creation) operator of the oscillator, $\\hat{n}=\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}$ is the number operator and $\\alpha$ is the anharmonicity. The $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ levels of this oscillator are the qubit levels. Leakage to higher levels and unitary errors due to mixing with these levels will be discussed in \u00a0<ref> and <ref>. For simplicity we rewrite just the qubit Hamiltonian,\n$$\n\nH/\\hbar = \\sum_{n} \\Omega_{n}(t) \\cos(\\omega_D t - \\gamma_n) \\hat{\\sigma}_X - \\frac{\\omega_{01}}{2} \\hat{\\sigma}_Z,\n\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\sigma}_{X},\\hat{\\sigma}_{Z}$ are the Pauli operators. For a resonant drive ($\\omega_D=\\omega_{01}$), the Hamiltonian in the qubit rotating frame is,\n$$\n\n\\tilde{H}/\\hbar = \\sum_{n} \\frac{\\Omega_{n}(t)}{2}  \\left[ \\cos(\\gamma_n) \\hat{\\sigma}_X + \\sin(\\gamma_{n}) \\hat{\\sigma}_Y\\right]\n$$\nAssuming a constant amplitude pulse $\\Omega_{n}$ for duration $T$, the unitary transformation (the gate) due to pulse $n$ is,\n$$\n\nU_n = e^{-i\\frac{\\Omega_n T}{2} \\left[ \\cos(\\gamma_n) \\hat{\\sigma}_X + \\sin(\\gamma_n) \\hat{\\sigma}_Y\\right]}, \\label{eqn:u_rot}\n\n$$\nand so a $\\gamma_n=0 (\\frac{\\pi}{2})$ pulse is a rotation of angle $\\Omega_n T$ around the X (Y) axis of the Bloch sphere. Therefore, the AWG controls both the pulse rotation and the rotation axes. Since $\\gamma$ controls the rotation axes, intuitively we can perform a VZ-gate by adjusting $\\gamma$. More formally, we can show how this works by consider two consecutive $X$ pulses, $X_{\\theta}=e^{-i\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\hat{\\sigma}_X}$, with the phase $\\gamma$ offset by $\\phi$ between the pulses. The total unitary is,\n$$\n\ne^{-i\\frac{\\theta}{2} (\\cos(\\phi)\\hat{\\sigma}_X + \\sin(\\phi) \\hat{\\sigma}_Y)} \\cdot X_{\\theta},\n\n$$\nwhich can be expanded to,\n$$\n\ne^{i\\frac{\\phi}{2} \\hat{\\sigma}_Z} \\cdot e^{-i\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\hat{\\sigma}_X} \\cdot e^{-i\\frac{\\phi}{2}\\hat{\\sigma}_Z} \\cdot X_{\\theta},\n\n$$\nwhich equals\n$$\n\nZ_{-\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta} \\cdot Z_{\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta}.\n\n$$\nTherefore, by simply adding a phase offset in software and redefining the rotation axes for subsequent X and Y gates, we can effectively implement an arbitrary Z-gate. The additional $Z_{-\\phi}$ gate at the end is due to the fact that we are in the qubit frame of reference and so the phase offset $\\phi$ must be carried through for all subsequent gates. For example, if we follow our original sequence with a $Y_{\\theta}$ gate with the phase offset applied the gate sequence is\n$$\n\n& &  e^{-i\\frac{\\theta}{2} \\left(\\cos\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\phi\\right]\\hat{\\sigma}_X + \\sin\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\phi\\right] \\hat{\\sigma}_Y\\right)} \\cdot \\ldots \\nonumber \\\\\n& & Z_{-\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta} \\cdot Z_{\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta}, \\\\\n& = &  Z_{-\\phi} \\cdot Y_{\\theta} \\cdot Z_{\\phi} \\cdot   Z_{-\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta} \\cdot Z_{\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta}, \\\\\n& = &  Z_{-\\phi} \\cdot Y_{\\theta} \\cdot  X_{\\theta} \\cdot Z_{\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta}.\n\n$$\nThe inverse Z-gate remains, but does not change the measurement outcomes which are measured along Z.\n\nGiven that we can easily create Z-gates, we now show that any arbitrary SU(2) gate can be constructed by combining Z-gates with two $X_{\\pi/2}$ gates. In general, any SU(2) gate can be written in the form,\n$$\n\nU(\\theta,\\phi,\\lambda) = \\left[\\begin{array}{cc} \\cos(\\theta/2) & -i e^{i\\lambda}\\sin(\\theta/2) \\\\ -ie^{i \\phi} \\sin(\\theta/2) & e^{i(\\lambda+\\phi)} \\cos(\\theta/2) \\end{array}\\right]\n\n$$\nwhich is conveniently represented (up to a global phase) as,\n$$\n\nU(\\theta,\\phi,\\lambda) = Z_{\\phi} \\cdot X_{\\theta} \\cdot Z_{\\lambda}.\n\n$$\nBy using the identity,\n$$\n\nX_{\\theta} = Z_{-\\pi/2} \\cdot X_{\\pi/2} \\cdot Z_{\\pi-\\theta} \\cdot X_{\\pi/2} \\cdot Z_{-\\pi/2},\n\n$$\nwe show that any SU(2) gate is\n$$\n\nU(\\theta,\\phi,\\lambda) = Z_{\\phi-\\pi/2} \\cdot X_{\\pi/2} \\cdot Z_{\\pi-\\theta} \\cdot X_{\\pi/2} \\cdot Z_{\\lambda-\\pi/2}.\n\n$$\nWe express some common gates in this notation in Table\u00a0(Table tab:gates).

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Planar and 3D architectures' section of the paper.", "completion": "Currently, there are two main types of device architectures in circuit QED: colloquially referred to as \u201cplanar\", where all quantum modes (e.\u00a0g.\u00a0qubits and linear resonators) are lithographically defined on chip; and \u201c3D\", where some modes are native to three dimensional structures. In both cases, however, a 3D package (a \u201csample box\") is engineered to enclose the electromagnetic modes of the circuit and prevent decoherence from microwave radiation loss.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nMain elements in 3D cQED devices (a) A sample device consisting of two 3D cavities (blue and orange), 3 transmon ancillae (purple, green, and red) together with their respective planar readount resonators (grey). All components are housed in a high-purity aluminium package. (b) The equivalent circuit representation of the device. (c) A more detailed illustration of the transmon and cavity interface. The coupling strength between the two is determined by the overlap between the transmon capacitor and the field (blue arrows) of the cavity. (d) A cross-sectional view of the coupling mechanism to the transmon and the readout reasonator via field-replaceable pins. (e) A schematic of the clamping structure for chips containing the transmon and its readout resonator.\n\nIn the 3D architectures (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:device_3d)), the large volume of vacuum inside the package (i.e.\u00a0the 3D cavity), typically a few cm$^3$ in size, is used as the linear modes in the cQED Hamiltonian. They couple weakly to transmission lines via coaxial center pins that are extended into apertures through the cavity wall (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:device_3d)(d)). These cavities also couple to qubits or other resonator modes, which are typically constructed using lithographically-patterned planar structures (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:device_3d)(c)) with large capacitor structures to provide effective coupling to the 3D cavity mode. They can be fabricated on one or more chips, which are mechanically clamped in place by nuts and bolts (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:device_3d)(e)). This architecture has several advantages, especially for a beginner experimentalist working with a small-scale quantum circuit:\n\n* It is simple to assemble: No peripheral structures and materials, such as printed circuit boards and wire-bonds, are needed to bridge the quantum modes and the external cables.\n\n* It provides a clean electromagnetic environment: The absence of peripheral structures saves the engineering effort to suppress spurious modes in the device package.\n\n* It exhibits good coherence times for the same material quality due to the small surface-to-volume ratio of the quantum modes. In particular, the long-lived 3D cavity modes prove to be a valuable quantum resource.\n\nThese appealing features make such 3D cQED devices powerful experimental testbeds for developments in quantum error correction\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and bosonic quantum simulations\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nHowever, there are also several important limitations associated with the current generation of devices based on machined cavities. The large spatial extent of the 3D cavity electromagnetic field makes it difficult to achieve good mode isolation within the same cavity. Furthermore, the lack of DC connection to the chip limits tunability and integration with circuit elements that require flux biasing. Active research is underway to develop techniques that could potentially resolve these challenges\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nA typical example of a planar cQED system. (a) A superconducting chip embedded in a printed circuit board (PCB) via wire bonds. The PCB provides the structures for grounding, microwave interconnects, and mounting elements to the sample box. (b) A more detailed view of a typical multi-qubit chip together with resonator buses and readout modes (dark grey). Each qubit can be controlled via on-chip flux (green) or microwave (blue) drive lines. (c) A typical flux-tunable transmon qubit capacitively coupled to several resonator modes.\n\nThe planar architecture (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:device_2d)) is centered around a lithographically-patterned cQED chip. The chip defines all the quantum modes desirable for the application, although the packaging around it may affect the fine details of the Hamiltonian parameters. Other than all the quantum circuit elements, the chip typically also includes feedlines, which are co-planar waveguides (CPW) impedance-matched to the input/output coaxial cables.  They are weakly coupled to the quantum circuit elements to supply and extract microwave signals. The chip is then embedded on a printed circuit board (PCB), with their corresponding CPW ports connected and their respective ground planes tied together, often using a large amount of wire-bonds. Bulk superconducting covers are attached to the ground plane of the PCB to enclose the chip into an area as small as possible (limited to less than $\\sim$1 cm$^2$ without on-chip 3D interconnects) to suppress the box modes. The PCB routes the input/output signal lines to a set of planar-to-coax transitions for external cable connections. More details on the design of microwave packaging for planar qubits can be found in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The electromagnetic modes and the coupling schemes in such systems are relatively local, therefore, well-engineered planar cQED devices afford many favorable features such as\n\n* Fast magnetic flux control of qubits, resonators or coupling elements,\n\n* Independent design of large numbers of quantum elements on the same chip with low cross-dependence of parameters,\n\n* Flexible access to individual elements locally.\n\nthat are not readily available in the 3D architecture yet.\n\nDue to these advantages, recent experiments with more than 10 qubits and resonators have generally adopted the planar approach. However, further scaling of planar devices beyond 50 qubits will likely require 3D integration of on-chip elements, employing techniques such as flip-chip indium bonding and through-silicon vias. Therefore, the two disparate device architectures, signified by the difference in their treatments of the box modes and ground planes, may eventually converge into a similar technological platform."}

{"prompt": "Explain the '## Towards larger anharmonicity: flux qubit and fluxonium' section of the paper.", "completion": "We see that split transmon qubits, be it symmetric or not, still share the same topology as the single junction version, yielding a sinusoidal potential. Therefore, the degree to which the properties of these qubits can be engineered has not fundamentally changed. In particular, the limited anharmonicity in transmon-type qubits intrinsically causes significant residual excitation to higher-energy states, undermining performance of gate operations. To go beyond this, it is necessary to introduce additional complexity into the circuit.\n\nOne outstanding development in this regard is the invention of the flux qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where the qubit loop is interrupted by three (or four) junctions, see Fig. <ref>(e). On one branch is one smaller junction; on the other branch are two identical junctions, both a factor $\\gamma$ larger in size compared to the small junction. The addition of one more junction as compared to the split transmon is non-trivial, as it changes the circuit topology and reshapes the potential energy profile.\n\nEach junction is associated with a phase variable, and the fluxoid quantization condition again allows us to eliminate one degree of freedom. Consequently, we have a two-dimensional potential landscape, which in comparison to the simpler topology of the transmon, complicates the problem both conceptually and computationally. Fortunately, under the assumed setting that the array junctions are larger in size ($\\gamma > 1$), it is usually a good approximation to treat the problem as a particle moving in a quasi-1D potential, which also helps us gain more insight and intuition about the system and draw qualitative conclusions. The Hamiltonian under this quasi-1D approximation reads,\n\n$$\n\nH \\approx 4E_Cn^2 - E_{J}\\cos(2\\phi + \\varphi_e) - 2\\gamma E_J\\cos(\\phi).\n\\label{Eq:FluxQubit}\n\n$$\n\nNote that the phase variable in Eq. (<ref>) is the sum of the branch phases across the two array junctions, $\\phi = (\\varphi_1 + \\varphi_2)/2$, assuming the same current direction across $\\varphi_1$ and $\\varphi_2$. The external magnetic flux is denoted $\\varphi_e = 2 \\pi  \\Phi_{ext}/\\Phi_0$. The second term in Eq. (<ref>) is contributed by the small junction with Josephson energy $E_J$, whereas the third term takes into account the two array junctions, together with Josephson energy $2\\gamma E_J$. Clearly, the sum of these two terms no longer has the characteristics of a simple cosinusoid, and the final potential profile as well as the corresponding eigenstates depends on both the external flux $\\varphi_e$ and the junction area ratio $\\gamma$.\n\nThe most common working point for this system is when $\\varphi_e = \\pi + 2\\pi k$, where $k$ is an integer \u2013 that is when half a superconducting flux quantum threads the qubit loop. At this flux bias point, the qubit spectrum reaches its minimum, and the qubit frequency is first-order insensitive to flux noise, see Fig. <ref>(f). This point is often referred to as the flux degeneracy point, where flux qubits tend to have the optimal coherence time.\n\nAt this operation point, the potential energy may assume a single-well ($\\gamma \\geq 2$) or a double-well ($\\gamma < 2$) profile. The single-well case shares some simularities with the transmon qubit, where the quadratic and quartic terms of the Hamiltonian determines the harmonicity and anharmonicity, respectively. The capacitively-shunted flux qubit (CSFQ)[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] was explored in this regime, demonstrating long coherence and decently high anharmonicity. Note that as opposed to the transmon qubit, the anharmonicity of the CSFQ is positive ($\\alpha > 0$). While the improvement in anharmonicity can be associated with reshaping the energy potential, the improved coherence over the first flux qubits can be attributed to the introduction of the capacitive shunt, similar to the modified Cooper-pair box leading to the transmon qubit.\n\nThe double-well case obtained for $\\gamma < 2$ was demonstrated and investigated much earlier[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The intuitive picture based on circulating current states \u2013 so it gets the name persisting-current flux qubit (PCFQ) \u2013 gives a satisfying physical description of the qubit degrees of freedom. However, from the perspective of a quantum engineer, the qubit properties are of more interest, even if sometimes we may lose physical intuition about the system in certain regimes; such as when $\\gamma \\approx 2$ and there are no clear circulating current states. The most important feature of the PCFQ is that its anharmonicity can be much greater than the transmon and CSFQ and the transition matrix elements $|\\langle 1|\\hat{n}|0\\rangle|, |\\langle 1|\\hat{\\phi}|0\\rangle|$ become considerably smaller given equivalent $E_J / E_C$. Therefore, a longer relaxation time can be expected. These features have been demonstrated even more prominently in its close relative, the fluxonium qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe flux qubit is a striking example that illustrates how one dramatically can engineer the qubit properties through the choice of various circuit parameters. The introduction of array junctions and consequent biharmonic profile generates rich dynamics as well as broad applications. An extention of this idea is the fluxonium qubit, which generated substantial interest recently, due partly to its capability of engineering the transition matrix elements to achieve millisecond $T_1$ time, and due partly to the invention of novel gate schemes applicable to such well-protected qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nCompared to flux qubits, which usually contain two or three array junctions[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the number of array junctions in the fluxonium qubit is dramatically increased[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], in some cases, to the order of $100$, see Fig. <ref>(g). Following the same quasi-1D approximation as for the flux qubit, the last term in Eq. (<ref>) becomes $-N\\gamma E_J \\cos (\\phi/N)$, where $N$ denotes the number of array junctions. For large $N$, the argument in the cosine term $\\phi/N$ becomes sufficiently small that a second order expansion is a good approximation. This results in the fluxonium Hamiltonian,\n\n$$\n\nH \\approx 4E_Cn^2 - E_{J}\\cos(\\phi + \\varphi_e) + \\frac{1}{2}E_L \\phi^2,\n\\label{Eq:Fluxonium}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $E_L = (\\gamma/N)E_J$ is the inductive energy of the effective inductance contributed by the junction array \u2013 often known as superinductance due to its large value\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Therefore, we can treat the potential energy as a quadratic term modulated by a sinusoidal term, similar to that of an rf-SQUID type flux qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, the kinetic inductance of the Josephson junction array is in general much larger than the geometric inductance of the wire in an rf-SQUID.\n\nDepending on the relative magnitude of $E_J$ and $E_L$, the fluxonium system could involve plasmon states (in the same well) and fluxon states (in different wells). There are a variety of schemes to utilize them for quantum information processing. Generally, the spectrum of the transition between the lowest energy states is similar to that of the flux qubit, see Fig. <ref>(h). Both long coherence and high anharmonicity can be expected at the flux sweet spot.\n\nLastly, we want to point out a further extension \u2013 the $0-\\pi$ qubit \u2013 which has even stronger topological protection from noise[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, the strongly suppressed sensitivity to external fluctuations also makes it hard to manipulate.\n\nInteraction Hamiltonian engineering\n\nTo generate entanglement between individual quantum systems \u2013 it is necessary to engineer an interaction Hamiltonian that connects degrees of freedom in those individual systems. In this section, we discuss the physical coupling mechanism and its representation in the qubit eigenbasis. The use of coupling to form 2-qubit gates is discussed in Sec. <ref>."}

For\na two-qubit gate, CZ fidelity as high as 99.4\nthe phase shift from near crossing of the $|11\\rangle$ and\n$|02\\rangle$ states, similar to previous work on superconducting\nqubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], but following a new \u201cfast\nadiabatic\u201d protocol that gives both fast gate times and low error\nrates.  Here we explain the theoretical concepts behind this\nprotocol, showing how waveforms may be generated and parameterized in\na manner that is readily optimized, both numerically and\nexperimentally.\n\nThe general problem of achieving fast adiabatic performance is of great interest to the physics community\n[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], with applications in coherent manipulation, precision measurements, and quantum computing.  Finding an improved control methodology therefore has potential for applications in a variety of quantum systems.\n\nAlthough adiabatic quantum control has a long history, we are not aware of a theory that could address in detail our particular experimental problem: what is the optimal control trajectory for the desired CZ operation, having both short gate time and small non-adiabatic error, described in a way that is readily optimized with numerical and experimental methods.  For example, although a previous experiment used adiabaticity for a CZ gate [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the characterization and optimization of the adiabatic control waveform was not developed.  The goal here is to describe a simple theory that can be used to intuitively understand optimal waveforms for fast and accurate operation.\n\nSince we are concerned here with transition errors between the states $|11\\rangle$ and $|02\\rangle$ as their frequencies are varied, we may map this to a qubit problem for states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ that has a fixed energy in $\\sigma_x$ from the avoided-level crossing and adjustable qubit frequency in $\\sigma_z$.  We note that this optimization problem differs from conventional quantum control, where the $\\sigma_z$ part of the Hamiltonian is fixed and both the $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$ parts can be varied.  Here, the single-component control in $\\sigma_z$ makes optimal control much more difficult since a second operator does not exist that could be used to restore the desired adiabatic character [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], disallowing standard pulse shaping techniques [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and \u201csuperadiabatic\u201d theory [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe set of possible adiabatic solutions is also influenced by other constraints with the superconducting qubit system.  First, the non-linearity of the qubits is small [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], so other unwanted transitions are not necessarily far off resonance.  For example, although the waveform is optimized for adiabaticity of the near resonance $|11\\rangle$ and $|02\\rangle$ states, fast changes in the control waveform may produce transitions between the states $|01\\rangle$ and $|10\\rangle$, even though off resonance by $\\gtrsim 200\\,\\textrm{MHz}$.  A natural solution to this constraint is using smooth waveforms, which also seems to be a good strategy in terms of controlling many qubits, achieving low crosstalk, and simplifying the requirements of control electronics and their system calibration.  We thus rule out pulse and refocussing type protocols common in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], but welcome any theory making this a practical solution.\n\nSecond, we are looking for control waveforms with fast gate times, of order $40\\,\\textrm{ns}$ for our qubits, that efficiently uses the moderate coupling $g/2\\pi \\simeq 30\\,\\textrm{MHz}$ between qubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]; note that $2\\pi/g = 33\\,\\textrm{ns}$, making this problem non-trivial for adiabaticity.  Fast gates are important for coherence, especially since errors from 1/f flux noise and off-resonant coupling to other qubits, described as frequency shifts, produce phase errors proportional to characteristic gate times: If limited by these processes, the error probability thus scales as the square of gate time.  A full system optimization of a qubit processor, for example describing the optimal choice of on-resonance qubit-qubit coupling $g$ and its smaller off-resonant coupling, is beyond the scope of this article.  But clearly even a small improvement of gate time can be quite important, motivating here a detailed understanding of both fast and accurate control.\n\nThird, the CZ gate uses adiabatic control that is non-standard, as it partially moves into the avoided level crossing regime and then back out again, with the amplitude and time of the waveform adjusted to give a $\\pi$ phase shift to the $|11\\rangle$ state.  Typical solutions to an adiabatic problem consider moving through an avoided-level crossings [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], so a theory is needed to calculate optimal waveforms for an arbitrary control problem.\n\nSince one varies only a single control parameter in $\\sigma_z$, this theory may be described in a simple manner with familiar concepts that give insight into a physical understanding of adiabatic behavior.  We first show how state change from $\\sigma_z$ control in the qubit Hamiltonian can be intuitively described in an instantaneous coordinate system.  Here, the evolution of the quantum system can be understood in the small error limit using a geometrical construction.  Second, this description allows errors to be calculated using a generalized Fourier transform.  Third, to obtain a minimum time solution for small changes in angle, the theory of window functions is used to find optimal control waveforms.  We then show how to efficiently parameterize the optimum waveform using a few-term Fourier series.  Lastly, a non-linear mapping is used to find the optimal control waveform for an arbitrary change in the control.\n\nWe also examine a second problem, microwave control of a qubit, and show that conventional two-component optimal control using $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$ gives better results as expected, but not by much.\n\nThese results present a simple yet effective way to optimize for adiabatic fidelity when changing control only in $\\sigma_z$.  Perhaps surprisingly, non-adiabatic errors can be small even if the interaction time is only slightly larger than the time scale of the transverse coupling, similar to that proposed earlier for a non-adiabatic gate [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  A recent experiment by our group has also demonstrated that these theoretical ideas can be used to optimize CZ performance [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n## Geometrical Solution\nWe start with a geometrical solution to non-adiabatic error, a problem previously described using conventional methods [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  The description of a qubit given by the 2-state Hamiltonian is\n$$\n\nH = H_x\\sigma_x + H_z\\sigma_z\n= \\left(\n\\begin{array}{cc}\nH_z & \\ \\ H_x \\\\\nH_x & -H_z \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right) \\ ,\n\n$$\nwhere $H_x$ is constant and the qubit frequency is controlled by a time dependent $H_z(t)$, for example the magnetic field in the z-direction for an electron spin.  We consider the qubit to be controlled by a Hamiltonian vector $(H_x,0,H_z)$, having both length and direction.  As shown in Fig. (Figure fig:bloch)a, we define the control parameter $\\theta$ as the angle between the Hamiltonian vector and the z-axis\n$$\n\n\\theta = \\arctan(H_x/H_z) \\ .\n\\label{eq:theta}\n\n$$\n\nThe qubit state is described by a Bloch vector that can point in any direction on the Bloch sphere.  Here, the usefulness of this geometric construction is the idea that the lowest energy eigenstate has a Bloch vector that points in the direction of the control vector: the eigenstate vector has angle $\\theta$ from vertical and lies in the plane of the $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{z}$ axes.  The ground state eigenvalue $E_-=-\\sqrt{H_x^2+H_z^2}$ is proportional to the length of the control vector, whereas the excited eigenstate points in the opposite direction with eigenenergy $E_+=-E_-$.  If the Bloch state vector is not an eigenstate, then its time dynamics is to rotate (precess) around the eigenstate vector at a frequency proportional to the difference in eigenstate energies\n$$\n\n\\omega = (E_+-E_-)/\\hbar =2\\sqrt{H_x^2+H_z^2}/\\hbar \\ .\n\\label{eq:omega}\n\n$$\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nGeometric picture of non-adiabatic errors.  a) Control field of constant $H_x$ and variable $H_z(t)$ gives control angle $\\theta$ from z-axis.  b) Bloch sphere representation gives ground eigenstate parallel to control vector (solid arrow).  For a small step in $\\theta$, the quantum state (gray arrow) points slightly away, with change $\\Delta \\theta$ (small gray arrow).  This state rotates around the eigenstate at frequency $\\omega$ (gray dotted lines).\n\nNon-adiabatic errors are typically understood by considering the Landau-Zener trajectory $H_z=\\dot{H}_z t$.  Initially at large negative times $t$, where $H_z$ is large and negative, the Hamiltonian control vector points in the down direction, with the state given by the Bloch vector also in the down direction having $\\theta = \\pi$.  As the time goes to zero, the control vector  $(H_x,0,H_z=0)$ points along the equator, with the Bloch vector $\\theta = \\pi/2$.  At large positive times the control and Bloch vector points in the up direction $\\theta = 0$.\n\nWhen the field is slowly varied $(\\dot{H}_z \\rightarrow 0)$, the state adiabatically changes from $\\theta = \\pi$ to $\\theta = 0$.  A finite ramp rate gives errors, with the probability to make a transition to the excited final eigenstate as\n$$\n\nP_e=\\exp(-\\pi H_x^2/\\hbar\\dot{H}_z) \\ .\n\n$$\nA small final error $P_e = 10^{-4}$ implies the condition $\\dot{H}_z=0.341\\,H_x^2/\\hbar$.  If we assume a change in $H_z$ from $-10 H_x$ to $10 H_x$, the total time for the control pulse is $t_c = 18.6\\,(h/2H_x)$, where $h/2H_x$ is the oscillation time for the transverse Hamiltonian.\n\nThe factor 18.6 implies a long control time for the Landau-Zener trajectory.  We will show with optimal control this time factor can be reduced significantly, to order unity.\n\nFor adiabatic evolution of the quantum state, the state vector stays aligned with the direction of the control Hamiltonian.  To better characterize non-adiabatic errors, we change the reference frame of the Bloch sphere to coincide with that of the control Hamiltonian.  In this moving frame $\\theta_m=0$ represents being in the ground state of the instantaneous Hamiltonian, with no non-adiabatic error.\n\nTo understand non-adiabatic deviations, we consider the time dynamics of state change.  We first consider an infinitesimal time step $\\Delta t$, during which the the control vector initially changes its direction by $\\Delta \\theta$, as shown in Fig. (Figure fig:bloch)b.  A transformation to the new moving frame produces a small change in the angle of the Bloch vector $-\\Delta \\theta$.  During the remainder of the time $\\Delta t$ the Bloch vector rotates around the $\\theta_m = 0$ axis, at the frequency $\\omega$.  Starting with $\\theta_m =  0$ before this time step, the angles $\\theta_x$ and $\\theta_y$ in the x- and y-direction can be written  compactly as\n$$\n\n\\theta_m \\equiv \\theta_x+i\\theta_y = -\\Delta\\theta \\, e^{-i\\omega \\Delta t}\n\n$$\nafter time $\\Delta t$, assuming small angles as appropriate for small non-adiabatic errors.  This finite angle implies the quantum state has not changed adiabatically (as $\\theta_m \\neq 0$), with the error probability given by $P_e = (\\sin|\\theta_m|/2)^2 \\approx |\\theta_m|^2/4$.\n\nWe next understand the error coming from a sequence of time steps $\\Delta t_i$ each with a small angle change $\\Delta \\theta_i$.  A useful simplification comes from changing to a new frame that rotates with the precession of the Bloch vector, which implies the above $\\theta_m$ vector does not rotate.  Instead, the change $\\Delta\\theta_i$ rotates in time by an angle $\\phi_i$, which is computed by summing over all the previous phase changes in the individual steps. The net change in the complex angle of the Bloch vector in this moving and rotating frame is\n$$\n\n\\theta_{mr} &= -\\sum_i \\Delta\\theta_i \\, e^{-i\\phi_i} \\\\\n&= -\\int dt\\,(d\\theta/dt) \\, \\exp[-i \\smallint^t \\omega(t') dt'] \\ , \\label{GLint}\\\\\nP_e&= |\\theta_{mr}|^2/4 \\ ,\n\n$$\nwhere $P_e$ is the total probability error.  These equations are the general solution for non-adiabatic error in the small error limit, derived here using a geometric description.\n\nThe amplitude error $\\theta_{mr}$ is proportional to the rate of change in the eigenstates, as given by $d\\theta/dt$.  This quantity is mostly averaged to zero because of the rapidly changing phase from the $\\omega$ integral, with averaged amplitude decreasing with increasing qubit frequency $\\omega$.\n\nNote that we have assumed here that all changes add linearly.  This is a good assumption as long as the net change in angle is very small; for example, it is known that for qubits with small change in state can be approximated by a harmonic oscillator, a linear system.  This assumption is generally acceptable since we are only interested in qubit control that give small errors.\n\nAn exact calculation of the error, starting from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, is derived in Appendix I.  It gives results identical to this geometrical solution in the small error limit.  There are two changes for the exact solution: the driving amplitude $d\\theta/dt$ should also be multiplied by the factor $\\cos|\\theta_{mr}|$, and the probability is $P_e=\\{\\sin[\\arcsin(\\theta_{mr})/2]\\}^2$.\n\nTo understand how to construct an optimal waveform, we first note that there is a trade-off between the control time and the magnitude of non-adiabatic error.  Zero error is not possible - we are instead looking for acceptably small errors, say below $10^{-4}$, with as short of a control time as possible.  We also want stable control waveforms, so that the error does not increase rapidly for small changes in the waveform.\n\nWe first note that non-adiabatic errors are proportional to a change in the control variable $\\theta$.  Errors will be relatively small when $|H_z| \\gg H_x$, due to the slow dependence of $\\theta$ on $H_z/H_x$ and the large oscillation frequency $\\omega$, as described in Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>).\n\nOPTIMAL SOLUTION: SMALL CHANGE IN $\\theta$\n\nFor the case where $H_z$ only changes by a small amount, the qubit frequency can be approximated as being constant $\\omega = \\omega_0$.  Then Eq. (<ref>) is just the Fourier transform of $d\\theta/dt$ at frequency $\\omega_0$, which gives a probability proportional to the power spectral density of the signal at the oscillation frequency $\\omega_0$\n$$\n\nP_e = (1/4)\\, S_{d\\theta/dt}(\\omega_0) \\ .\n\n$$\nThis makes sense physically since it is power at the transition frequency, given by $|\\theta_{mr}|^2$, that drives the qubit transition to produce errors.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(color online) Waveform and power spectral density $S(\\omega_0)$, for a small change in control $\\theta$ such that the qubit frequency is approximately constant $\\omega = \\omega_0$.  Here, the spectral density is dimensionless and proportional to the qubit error $P_e \\simeq (1/4)S(\\omega_0)$, valid in the limit of large $t_p$.  a) Plot of waveform $d\\theta/dt$ versus $t/t_p$ for a rectangular pulse (i, black), Hanning window (1, blue), Slepian (ii, gray), and optimized Fourier coefficients with two (2, red), four (4, green), and ten (10, cyan) terms.  Note the similarity of the Slepian curves to the optimized Fourier functions, except near $t/t_p=0,1$.  b) Plot of power spectral density obtained from a Fourier transform of the waveforms in a). All waveforms are normalized to have unit area.  The vertical dashed line shows spectral cutoff for minimization of integrated noise.\n\nFor the simple case of a linear change in the control $\\theta$ from $\\theta_i$ to $\\theta_f$, the error is proportional to the (constant) derivative $d\\theta /dt=(\\theta_f - \\theta_i)/t_p$, shown as the black line in Fig. (Figure fig:Theta)a.  The error versus the pulse time $t_p$ is the power spectral density of a rectangular pulse\n$$\n\nP_e^\\textrm{sq} = (1/4)\\Big|(d\\theta/dt) \\int_0^{t_p} dt \\exp(-i\\omega_0 t) \\Big|^2 \\\\\n= (\\theta_f-\\theta_i)^2 \\sin^2(\\omega_0t_p/2)/\\omega_0^2 t_p^2 \\ ,\n\n$$\nwhich corresponds to the square of the sinc function.  Although the error is zero when $t_p = 2\\pi/\\omega_0$, small errors occur only around a small range of this time, so we consider this solution not to be stable or practically useful.  For large times, the general falloff of the error is quite slow, scaling as $1/t_p^2$, so this control waveform does not present a good solution to adiabatic control.\n\nThe functional dependence of the error versus pulse time can be changed by using different control waveforms [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  Another example is the function $[1-\\cos(2\\pi t/t_p)]/2$, known as the Hanning window, as shown in blue in Fig. (Figure fig:Theta).  In this case, the error is\n$$\n\nP_e^\\textrm{H}\n= P_e^\\textrm{sq} /|1-(\\omega_0 t_p/2\\pi)^2|^2\\ ,\n\n$$\nwhere the first zero is at twice the time of the square window $t_p=4\\pi/\\omega_0$, but the error falls off more quickly as $1/t_p^6$ at large times.  Although this window function is superior to the square window, the errors are still somewhat large right after the first zero, so other window functions should be considered.\n\nAs well known from NMR [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], optimizing non-adiabatic error versus total control time $t_p$ can be understood as optimizing windowing functions: the optimization criteria depend on the requirements for a particular application.\n\nSince we are interested in low errors for a range of pulse times, we define the optimal waveform as one that gives low error for any time larger than some chosen time: this definition is essentially equivalent to adiabatic behavior.\nWe can use the theory of optimal window functions in signal processing to find this control waveform, known as a Slepian [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  This function is defined by finding the optimal waveform that minimizes the integrated spectral density above a chosen frequency.  For example, the Slepian waveform optimized for frequencies above $\\omega_0 t_p/2\\pi > 2.3$ is shown in gray in Fig. (Figure fig:Theta).  Although the first minimum is at slightly longer times than for the Hanning window, the error is always below $10^{-5}$ above this value.  A different Slepian cutoff parameter can be used to tradeoff the maximum error for the time of the first minimum.\n\nA disadvantage of the Slepian function is that it does not go to zero at the beginning and end of the pulse, which creates a sharp edge as for a rectangular pulse.  This makes the function harder to synthesize, since real waveform generators have finite response times.  A practical way around this issue is to find a near optimum solution using Fourier basis functions [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] given by\n$$\n\n\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} &= \\sum_{n=1,2,\\ldots, n_m} \\lambda_n [1-\\cos(2\\pi n t/t_p)] \\ , \\label{eq:dth}\n\n$$\nwhich goes smoothly to zero at the beginning and end of the pulse. The coefficients are constrained by the height of the pulse\n$$\n\n\\theta_f-\\theta_i &= t_p \\sum_n \\lambda_n \\ .\n\n$$\nUsing standard numerical minimization ( function in MATLAB), the coefficients $\\{ \\lambda_n \\}$ can be found that optimizes for the minimum integrated spectral density, as for the Slepian. The waveform and spectral densities for $n_m = 2, 4,$ and $10$ are plotted in Fig. (Figure fig:Theta), which shows performance close to the Slepian.   Coefficients are given in Table (Table tab:lamfourier), showing the first two are dominant.  It is particularly interesting to note that the waveform for $n_m=2$ (red), with only 2 Fourier coefficients, is reasonably close in shape to the Slepian and has acceptably small errors $<10^{-4}$.\n\nTable of $\\lambda_n$ coefficients obtained from numerical minimization of noise for frequencies $\\omega_0 t_p/2\\pi > 2.3$, using the constraint $\\sum \\lambda_n =1$.\n\n$n_m$     $\\lambda_1$      $\\lambda_2$      $\\lambda_3$      $\\lambda_4$\n$\\lambda_5$      $\\lambda_6$      $\\lambda_7$ 2     1.0866     -0.0866         4     1.0751     -0.0811     0.0017     0.0044 10     1.0280     -0.0606      0.0052     0.0055     0.0047     0.0046     0.0035\n\nThe Fourier basis functions can also include the terms $\\lambda_n^s \\sin(\\pi n t/t_p)$ for $n$ odd, which go to zero at $t=0, t_p$ but have non-zero derivatives there.  Upon using this larger basis set, we find the numerically optimized solutions are not much better than found above only using cosine terms.  We choose not use use these sine basis functions because we prefer to also have a zero derivative at the beginning and end of the pulse.\n\nWe are also interested in control waveforms that take an initial $\\theta_i$ to $\\theta_f$ and then back again to $\\theta_i$.  In this case the waveform for $\\theta$, not $d\\theta/dt$, is given by the Fourier basis\n$$\n\n\\theta - \\theta_i &= \\sum_{n=1,2,\\ldots, n_m} \\lambda_n' [1-\\cos(2\\pi n t/t_p)] \\ ,\n\\label{eq:dthprime}\n\n$$\nwith constraints on the coefficients\n$$\n\n\\theta_f-\\theta_i &= 2 \\sum_{n \\textrm{ odd}} \\lambda_n' \\ .\n\\label{eq:dthprimecon}\n\n$$\nThe derivative $d\\theta/dt$ is now a sum of sine functions, which have non-zero derivatives at the beginning and end of the pulse.  Figure (Figure fig:DTheta) shows optimized results for 1, 2, and 3 Fourier coefficients, as well as for the first-harmonic solution of the Slepian.  As for the previous case, the optimized Fourier solution is close to that of the Slepian: only two coefficients (red curve) is required for close approximation to the ideal solution.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(color online) Waveform and power spectral density ($S(\\omega_0) \\simeq 4P_e$) as for Fig. (Figure fig:Theta), but with a trajectory from $\\theta_i$ to $\\theta_f$ and back.  a) Plot of waveform $d\\theta/dt$ versus $t/t_p$ for optimized Fourier coefficients with one (1, blue), two (2, red), and three (3, green) terms, as well as Slepian (i, gray).  b) Plot of power spectral density from Fourier transforms of the waveforms in a). Waveforms normalized using $2\\sum \\lambda_n' = 1$.\n\nOPTIMUM SOLUTION: ARBITRARY $\\theta$\n\nThe optimal solution for an arbitrary change in $\\theta$ will have to account for the qubit frequency $\\omega$ changing during the control pulse. The solution is found by first making a coordinate transformation to an accelerating frame in time where the oscillation frequency is constant, and then using optimal waveforms as found previously.\n\nThe basic idea is to define a new frame with time $\\tau$ such that the rate of change of the phase is constant.  Choosing this frequency as the constant $\\omega_x=2H_x/\\hbar$, the times are related by\n$$\n\n\\omega_x \\,d\\tau = \\omega(t)\\, dt \\ .\\label{eq:wt}\n\n$$\nIn this frame, the error angle from Eq. (<ref>) becomes\n$$\n\n\\theta_{mr} &=\n-\\int d\\tau\\,(d\\theta/d\\tau) \\, \\exp[-i \\omega_x \\tau] \\ , \\label{GLtauint}\n\n$$\nso that the optimal shape of $d\\theta(\\tau)/d\\tau$ can be computed for constant frequency $\\omega_x$, as done in the last section.  Integration of $d\\theta/d\\tau$ is next used to compute the quantity $\\theta(\\tau)$.  The relationship between the real time $t$ and $\\tau$ is finally solved by integrating Eq. (<ref>)\n$$\n\nt(\\tau)&=\\int^{\\tau} d\\tau' \\, \\omega_x/\\omega(\\tau') \\\\\n&= \\int^\\tau d\\tau'\\, \\sin\\theta(\\tau') \\ ,\n\n$$\nwhere in the last equation we have used Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>) to find the relation $\\omega=\\omega_x/\\sin\\theta$.\nThe function $t(\\tau)$ can be inverted numerically using interpolation.  For example, in MATLAB code the dependence $\\theta(t)$ would be given through the interpolation of the vectors $t(\\tau)$ and $\\theta(\\tau)$ using the command  $\\theta(t)$ =$(t(\\tau),\\theta(\\tau),t)$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(color online) Waveform and error for $H_z$ changing from $-10H_x$ to $10H_x$.  a) Blue lines are plot of control $\\theta(t)$ versus $t/t_p$ for two (solid) and three (dashed) Fourier coefficients.  The right scale shows the waveform $H_z(t)$ as green lines.  b) Plot of non-adiabatic error versus pulse time $t_p$ for linearized and exact solutions, with both two and three optimized coefficients. Low errors can be achieved for times greater than  $t_p = 2\\pi/\\omega_x$, corresponding to one oscillation at the avoided level crossing. We define $\\omega_x=2H_x/\\hbar$.\n\nTo illustrate this solution for an arbitrary control problem, we first consider the avoided level crossing from $H_z=-10H_x$ to $ H_z=10H_x$, as discussed earlier for the Landau-Zener trajectory.  The waveform is shown as solid lines in Fig. (Figure fig:LZopt)a for the 2 Fourier coefficients $\\{ \\lambda_1 = 1.086, \\lambda_2=-0.086 \\}$ found earlier.  Here we find the control waveform is nearly linear in $\\theta$, not in $H_z$ as assumed for the standard Landau-Zener problem.  The non-adiabatic error $P_e$ is plotted in Fig. (Figure fig:LZopt)b, both for the linearized (black) and the exact (blue) solution of the qubit dynamics.  The linearized solution has similar shape to that found earlier, as expected, whereas the exact solution shows significantly higher errors, demonstrating that an exact solution for this control problem is important.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(color online) Waveform and error for $H_z$ changing from $10\\,H_x$ to $1.17\\,H_x$, and then back to $10H_x$.  a) Black line (1) is for optimal waveform, whereas blue line (2) includes the effect of waveform rounding by control electronics, here accounted for by a convolution.  b) Plot of non-adiabatic error versus pulse time $t_p$ for the two cases, using exact solutions.  Optimal coefficients are $\\{ \\lambda_2', \\lambda_3' \\} = \\{-0.19,0\\}$ for black (1) and $\\{-0.16,0.04\\}$ for blue (2) line.\n\nTo further reduce error, we next optimize the $\\lambda_n$ coefficients for better performance.  Shown in green is the best performance obtained for varying $\\lambda_2$, whereas the red curve shows optimal performance for a choice of $\\lambda_2$ and $\\lambda_3$.  It is impressive that non-adiabatic errors in the $10^{-5}$ range can be obtained with only a small number of coefficients.  Also note that that low errors occurs at a pulse time $t_p$ equal to one oscillation period $h/2H_x$ of the avoided level crossing, about 20 times faster than the simple Landau-Zener trajectory.\n\nAnother important waveform is for a controlled pulse in $\\theta$, as shown earlier in Fig. (Figure fig:DTheta).  Here we consider the control angle changing from $\\theta_i = 0.1$ to $\\theta_f = 0.55\\,\\pi/2$, then back again to $\\theta_i$; these parameters are chosen to give the CZ gate $|11\\rangle \\rightarrow \\exp(i\\pi)|11\\rangle$, where this additional $\\pi$ phase shift comes from the avoided level crossing between the states $|11\\rangle$ and $|02\\rangle$.  In this case $\\theta(\\tau)$ is given by Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>), and $\\theta(t)$ is found as for the last example.  We find a near optimal solution for only one additional coefficient $\\lambda_2' = -0.19$, as shown in black in Fig. (Figure fig:CZ).  We obtain very low error for a total control time about one oscillation of $\\omega_x/2\\pi$.\n\nThis waveform requires fast changes in $H_x$ at the beginning and end of the pulse.  Because of the finite bandwidth of the control electronics, such a shape may not be possible to synthesize, so we next consider the optimal control including rounding of the waveform, here accounted for by convolution of the output waveform with a Gaussian.  With convolution, the computed non-adiabatic error increases significantly with the original $\\lambda_2'$ coefficient.  We found that adjusting $\\lambda_2'$ could not improve the error much, but by including the next coefficient $\\lambda_3'$ the error could be effectively minimized.  This optimal solution is shown as the blue line in Fig. (Figure fig:CZ), where low error is now found at about twice the oscillation period of $\\omega_x/2\\pi$.  Note that about 1/2 of the increase in time of the control waveform is accounted for by the extra time added at the beginning and end of the pulse from convolution.\n\n## Optimum solution for 2-state errors\nThe Fourier basis may be used to optimize waveforms for other control problems, so it is natural to ask whether these ideas can be used to minimize the excitation to the second excited state when driving weakly anharmonic qubits.  This corresponds to the standard problem for optimal control, where shaping occurs in the off-diagonal $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$ parts of the Hamiltonian.  A solution that works extremely well is waveform shaping by Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  It is interesting to consider whether simple shaping using the Fourier basis waveforms can improve upon DRAG.\n\nErrors from the $|2\\rangle$ state come in two forms: (I) direct transitions to $|2\\rangle$ producing 2-state errors, and (II) virtual excitations to $|2\\rangle$, producing an AC Stark shift between the qubit states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ that give changes in rotation amplitude and direction.  The transition frequencies between the states $|0\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |1\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |2\\rangle$ are $\\omega_0$ and $\\omega_0+\\Delta$, which defines a nonlinearity $\\Delta$ that is negative for transmons.\n\n(I) Transitions to the 2-state come from the drive waveform having spectral density at the $|1\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |2\\rangle$ frequency.  As the drive needs to be resonant with the $|0\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |1\\rangle$\ntransition, it can be described in general with a two-quadrature form  $x(t)\\cos(\\omega_0 t)+y(t)\\sin(\\omega_0 t)$, which can be written compactly in complex notation as $[x(t)-iy(t)]\\exp(i\\omega_0 t)$.  The drive waveform for DRAG has the quadrature component proportional to the time derivative $\\dot{x}(t)$\n$$\n\nW(t)=[x(t)-iD\\, \\dot{x}(t)/\\Delta]e^{i\\omega_0 t} \\ ,\n\n$$\nwith its magnitude adjusted by a dimensionless derivative parameter $D$.  The transition rate is expected to scale as the spectral density of $W$, which is the squared magnitude of the Fourier transform\n$$\n\nW(\\omega) &= \\int dt \\, e^{-i\\omega t} W(t) \\\\\n&= [1+D(\\omega-\\omega_0)/\\Delta] \\int dt \\ e^{-i\\omega t} x(t)e^{i\\omega_0 t} \\ ,\n\n$$\nwhere integration by parts is used [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] to shift the derivative of $x$ to the term $\\exp[i(\\omega_0 -\\omega)t]$.  Driving the $|0\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |1\\rangle$ transition at $\\omega_0$, the spectral density is zero at the $|1\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |2\\rangle$ transition frequency ($\\omega-\\omega_0=\\Delta$) when $D=-1$.  As this is a qualitative argument, we use numerical simulation to minimize the population error to the 2-state; below we show our optimal DRAG coefficient is $D=-1.20$, close to the computed value.\n\n(II) The origin of the AC Stark shift can be understood as coming from level repulsion between the $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$ states when driven off-resonance, which changes the frequency of $|1\\rangle$ state proportional to $-x^2/2\\Delta$.  The derivative term also Stark shifts the qubit, giving a net shift [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] proportional to $-(1+2D)x^2/2\\Delta$.  As the $x^2$ term gives a shift that is time dependent, a practical solution is to choose $D=-1/2$ for no Stark shift, allowing the qubit frequency to be constant [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  In this case transition errors to the 2-state are not optimized, but the solution is still useful since errors are lowered by $(1+D)^2 = 1/4$.\n\nAs we wish to use $D=-1$ for minimum 2-state errors, we note here there exists another practical solution: constant detuning of the microwave frequency.  This works because the dynamic Stark shift, which produces a small change in the rotation direction of the Bloch vector in the qubit subspace, can always be compensated for by a static change in drive frequency and phase.  Equivalently stated, the three parameters of the drive frequency, phase and amplitude moves the Bloch vector by any desired rotation direction and angle.  Finding zero error thus becomes the same procedure as for normal tuning up of qubit gates, only here the frequency and phase must be separately tuned for $\\pi/2$ and $\\pi$ rotations.  As this optimization can always be performed, we need only be concerned with 2-state errors.\n\nThese ideas were evaluated using numerical simulations of a 3-level system with $\\Delta$ nonlinearity, integrating the Hamiltonian matrix over the waveform pulse to find the net unitary transformation.  We find good performance using the Fourier basis, shown initially for a drive $x(t) \\propto 1-\\cos(2\\pi t/t_p)$ with amplitude adjusted to give a $\\pi$-pulse.  As we find transition probabilities for $|0\\rangle \\rightarrow |2\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle \\rightarrow |2\\rangle$ are quite close in magnitude, we plot in Fig. (Figure fig:HD) the average of these 2-state errors versus pulse time $t_p$ normalized with the qubit anharmonicity $|\\Delta|/2\\pi$.  Here, we optimize amplitude and detuning parameters for qubit subspace errors below $10^{-7}$ at $t_p |\\Delta|/2\\pi \\simeq 2.5$; we find the 2-state errors change little when slightly varying these parameters to zero errors at different values of $t_p$.  The error without a derivative $D=0$ is plotted in black.  The waveform with the half-derivative $D=-0.48$, plotted in red, shows a reduction in error by about a factor of 4 that is consistent with the above argument.  As expected, we find a much better solution using the DRAG coefficient near unity $D=-1.20$, as plotted in green.\n\nWe also tested for waveform optimization of $x(t)$ by adjusting the Fourier coefficient $\\lambda_2$.  For the $D=0$ case we find better performance for $\\lambda_2=-0.07$, plotted in blue, with an average magnitude similar to the $D=-0.48$ solution.  For $D=-1.20$ and $\\lambda_2=-0.05$, plotted in purple, we found adjusting $\\lambda_2$ shifted the first minimum; we thus propose that this parameter can be used to tune for a somewhat smaller 2-state error.\n\nComparing to plots in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] using a truncated Gaussian waveform, we find the $D=-0.48$ solution has errors comparable to first order DRAG (purple curve of their Fig. 3).  Our $D=-1.20$ solution is about one order of magnitude below the second order DRAG solution (green curve of their Fig. 4) for $t_p |\\Delta|/2\\pi \\lesssim 3.1$.  We conjecture that combining second-order DRAG with our optimized Fourier-based waveforms would perform even better.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(color online) Average probability of two-state population versus pulse time $t_p$ for a qubit $\\pi$-pulse.

DRAG term $D=$ 0, -0.48 and -1.20 are shown in black (1), red (3) and green (4), respectively.  Optimization of the waveform $x(t)$ with Fourier coefficient $\\lambda_2$ are shown in blue (2) and purple (5).\n\nWaveforms corrected by a derivative term with $D=-1.20$ produce a good optimum solution.  However, one-component optimal control is not that much slower, acceptable for problems where there is only access to $\\sigma_z$ control.\n\n## conclusion\nWe have shown that an optimal control waveform for adiabatic behavior may be obtained by minimizing the spectral weight integrated above a cutoff frequency.  Although the best solution is a Slepian, optimization of a few-term Fourier series shows comparably low errors, with acceptable performance achieved with only two or three coefficients.  This solution can be used for arbitrary control, even when the transition frequency is changing in time, by first solving the problem with a fixed frequency and then transforming to the proper time frame.  We find effects of finite bandwidth in the control waveform can be readily accounted for by optimizing the Fourier coefficients.  This method of solution can be used for other control problems, such as minimizing the 2-state occupation for a single qubit $\\pi$-pulse.\n\nWith this protocol, we find that gates with intrinsic error below $10^{-4}$ should be possible for the two-qubit controlled-phase operation, even for relatively fast gate times.  This theoretical understanding may help open up a route to ultra-high fidelity quantum operations and fault tolerant quantum computation.\n\nWe thank A. Korotkov for helpful discussions.

We start by considering the effect of a rotation around the $H_x$-axis.  If the wavefunction in a fixed basis is given by $|\\Psi\\rangle = a|0\\rangle + b |1\\rangle$, then it can be rewritten in a basis rotated by the angle $\\theta$ as $|\\Psi\\rangle = \\alpha |-\\rangle + \\beta |+\\rangle$, re-expressed in eigenstates of the new basis with amplitudes given by\n$$\n\n\\alpha &= a \\cos(\\theta/2) - b \\sin(\\theta/2) \\ ,\\\\\n\\beta &= b \\cos(\\theta/2) + a \\sin(\\theta/2) \\ .\n\n$$\n\nIn the $\\theta$-rotated basis we define the energy eigenvalues as $\\pm \\omega/2$, which introduces phase factors that has differential form $\\dot{\\alpha} = -i (\\omega/2)\\alpha$ and $\\dot{\\beta} = i (\\omega/2) \\beta$.  We are interested in changes in the control vector, so if $\\theta$ changes with time one finds\n$$\n\n\\dot{\\alpha} &= -i(\\omega/2)\\alpha-a\\sin(\\theta/2)\\,\\dot{\\theta}/2 -b\\cos(\\theta/2)\\,\\dot{\\theta}/2 \\\\\n&= (-i\\omega\\alpha-\\dot{\\theta}\\beta )/2 \\ ,\\\\\n\\dot{\\beta} &= (+i\\omega\\beta + \\dot{\\theta}\\alpha )/2 \\ .\n\n$$\nNote the symmetry of the rotations, with factors $i\\omega$ for the time-dependence of $H_z$ rotations, and $\\dot{\\theta}$ for the $H_x$ rotation.\n\nThe time dependence can be described simply if one considers the quantity $\\alpha^*\\beta$, where $^*$ is the complex conjugate.  Its derivative is\n$$\n\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\big(\\alpha^* \\beta\\big) &= (i\\omega\\alpha^*-\\beta^* \\dot{\\theta})\\beta/2 +\n\\alpha^*(i\\omega\\beta + \\alpha \\dot{\\theta})/2 ] \\\\\n&= i\\omega (\\alpha^* \\beta)+(|\\alpha|^2-|\\beta|^2)\\dot{\\theta}/2 \\\\\n&= i\\omega (\\alpha^* \\beta)+\\sqrt{1-4|\\alpha^*\\beta|^2}\\ \\dot{\\theta}/2 \\ ,\\label{LZde}\n\n$$\nwhere in the last equation we have used the relation\n$$\n\n\\big(|\\alpha|^2-|\\beta|^2\\big)^2 & = |\\alpha|^4+2|\\alpha|^2|\\beta|^2+|\\beta|^4 - 4|\\alpha^*\\beta|^2 \\\\\n& = \\big(|\\alpha|^2+|\\beta|^2\\big)^2 - 4|\\alpha^*\\beta|^2 \\\\\n& = 1 - 4|\\alpha^*\\beta|^2 \\ .\n\n$$\nNote that the square root factor in Eq. (<ref>) changes sign when $|\\alpha|^2-|\\beta|^2$ is negative.\n\nFor Bloch vector angles $\\Theta$ and $\\varphi$ the amplitudes are $\\alpha=\\cos(\\Theta/2)$ and $\\beta=\\sin(\\Theta/2)e^{i\\varphi}$, which gives\n$$\n\n\\alpha^*\\beta &= \\cos(\\Theta/2)\\sin(\\Theta/2)e^{i\\varphi} \\\\\n&=\\sin\\Theta \\,e^{i\\varphi} /2 \\ .\n\n$$\nso that its magnitude is the error probability $P_e = [\\sin(\\Theta/2)]^2 \\approx |\\alpha^*\\beta|$ only for small angles $\\Theta$. Inserting this result for $\\alpha^*\\beta$ into Eq. (<ref>), one finds\n$$\n\n\\frac{d}{dt}(\\sin\\Theta \\,e^{i\\varphi}) = i\\omega (\\sin\\Theta \\,e^{i\\varphi}) + \\cos \\Theta\\  \\dot{\\theta} \\ .\n\n$$\nChanging phase variables $\\varphi = \\varphi' + \\phi$, where $\\phi = \\int \\omega dt$ and noting that $d\\phi/dt = \\omega$, we can remove the $i\\omega$ phase term\n$$\n\n\\frac{d}{dt}(\\sin\\Theta \\,e^{i\\varphi'}) = \\cos \\Theta\\  \\dot{\\theta} e^{-i\\phi} \\ ,\n\n$$\nwhich is equivalent to previous geometrical result Eq. (<ref>) in the low amplitude limit $\\Theta \\rightarrow 0$.  Here, the exact solution has the amplitude of the drive term $d\\theta /dt$ rescaled by $\\cos\\Theta$ to account for the geometry of the Bloch sphere.\n\n10\n\nRami13 R. Barends, J. Kelly, A.

We find that in the strongly-driven dispersive regime of this system, there is the unexpected onset of a high-transmission \u201cbright\u201d state at a critical power which depends sensitively on the initial qubit state.  A simple and robust measurement protocol exploiting this effect achieves a single-shot fidelity of 87\n\nCircuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) is the study of the interaction of light and matter where superconducting qubits playing the role of atoms are strongly coupled to microwave transmission line resonators acting as cavities [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  This architecture offers advantages over cavity QED with atomic systems with regard to both coupling strength and accessibility of strongly driven nonlinear regimes [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  For example, the high-power response of a cavity with a qubit in resonance has recently been studied, demonstrating the appearance of additional photon number ($n$) resonances with characteristic $\\sqrt{n}$ spacing, in excellent agreement with theory [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  In this Letter, we investigate the behavior of a strongly driven cQED system in the dispersive regime, where four strongly coupled transmon qubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] are far detuned from the cavity.  We find that for increasing drive strength, the cavity response initially becomes strongly nonlinear and  continuously shifts down in frequency.  At a critical power, it reaches its bare frequency and transmission rapidly rises to a \u201cbright state\u201d.  Importantly, this critical power is strongly dependent on the initial state of the qubit, providing for a simple high-fidelity qubit readout mechanism.  This scheme is also applicable to the joint measurement of several qubits simultaneously.\n\nThere are two commonly used cQED readout schemes.  The first employs the state-dependent dispersive shift of the coupled cavity's resonance frequency [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:pspec1q)(a)] to infer the qubit state by measuring transmission [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  This must be done in the low-power, linear response regime of the cavity in part because system anharmonicity inhibits higher population.  The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fidelity of this weak measurement is thus limited (to typically 40\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color)\nCavity transmission as a function of drive power and frequency, demonstrating the \u201cbright\u201d state at high incident power.\n(a) Dispersively shifted cavity response for excited (blue) and ground (red) states of the $8\\ghz$ qubit with $\\sim1$\u00a0photon mean cavity occupation.  We reference this power to 0\u00a0dB.  For all plots in this figure, the $8\\ghz$ qubit is prepared, a measurement tone is pulsed on, and the responding homodyne amplitude is averaged for 400\u00a0ns to yield $\\overline{A_{\\mathrm{H}}}$.  The mV scale used is arbitrary, but consistent to ease comparison.  The $x$-axis for (a-e) is frequency and covers the same range as for (f-g).\n(b-d) Cavity response for increasing drive power, with data for previous power plotted with dashed lines.  Transmission is inhibited by the cavity's inherited nonlinearity, limiting dispersive measurement fidelity.  Note for example that increasing drive 10\u00a0dB from (b) to (c) increases $\\overline{A_{\\mathrm{H}}}$ by only a factor of $\\sim2$ and complicates the frequency dependence.  The emergence of a distinct resonance can be seen in (d).\n(e) High-transmission bright state.  At large drive power, the Jaynes-Cummings cavity anharmonicity shrinks sufficiently to allow near-unity transmission at $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$.  For this power the system only reaches its bright state when the qubit is excited due to the asymmetry of the dispersive cavity shift about $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$.  This asymmetry is characteristic to the transmon qubit [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] but might be possible to simulate for other designs [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n(f-g) Cavity response (log magnitude) for qubit ground and excited states.  The cavity continuously evolves from its low power linear behavior through the anharmonic bistable region and to the bright state.  There are two peaks present in (g) due to qubit relaxation during measurement.  The symbols (+) denote the optimal power and frequency for qubit readout, where the cavity response for the two qubit states is maximally different.\n(h) Response at $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$ (arrows) versus input power, showing a steep jump in transmission corresponding to the onset of the bright state at a qubit-state-dependent power.  Though transmission state dependence exists elsewhere, the behavior here is especially amenable for use as a qubit readout because the difference is large compared to amplifier noise.\n\nOur readout scheme exploits the unusual behavior of the system when driven strongly.  For low drive strength, the cavity (at $f_{\\mathrm{bare}} = 9.070\\ghz$) is dispersively shifted many linewidths by the strongly coupled transmons at frequencies $(f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4) = (6.000, 7.000, 8.000, 12.271)\\ghz~\\pm~2\\mhz$ (see Supplement for device details).  The cavity also inherits anharmonicity ($\\alpha$, the frequency difference between subsequent cavity transitions) from the interaction, which inhibits transmission for larger power [Figs.\u00a0(Figure fig:pspec1q)(a-d)].  For small number of excitations $n$, $\\alpha$ is to first order constant [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], though higher order terms are often considered as $n$ approaches a critical value [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  This expansion neglects the high-power behavior of the system, which can be recovered with a semiclassical model, shown previously for the case of a qubit and cavity in resonance [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  In a parallel publication [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], Bishop et al. consider the case of a large cavity-qubit detuning semiclassically and show that for increasing $n$, $\\alpha$ decreases monotonically and the cavity frequency ($f_c$) shifts toward $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$, in qualitative agreement with our observations.  The measured cavity output power as a function of incident drive power and frequency thus smoothly evolves from a linear relation at low occupation ($n\\sim1$), where the shift due to increasing $n$ is small compared to cavity linewidth, to a nonlinear relation at intermediate $n$ where $\\alpha$ is important [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:pspec1q)(f)].  A dip in transmission likely caused by interference between two bistable solutions follows the cavity down in frequency with increasing power and disappears at $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$.  At large drive power, the cavity reaches a near-unity transmission \u201cbright state\u201d where $f_c \\to f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$ and $\\alpha \\to 0$.  This power is $\\sim 50,000$ times larger than what induces a one-photon mean population, producing a signal large compared to measurement noise.  We reference the one-photon power to 0\u00a0dB.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nMeasurement transients and histograms for single-shot measurement of one qubit (at $8\\ghz$).\n(a) Three measurements of single-shot system response $V_{\\mathrm{H}}(t)$ to driving at $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$ with a power $P_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ for prepared qubit ground and excited states, low-passed to the response time of the cavity $1/\\kappa\\approx 100$\u00a0ns.  They are reproducible and well-distinguished, demonstrating that the response is large compared to the measurement noise.\n(b) Histograms and S-curves quantifying measurement fidelity.  An ensemble of single-shot responses are integrated for 500\u00a0ns and their distribution plotted. The two histogram peaks (solid lines) are well separated with few counts between them.  Integrating these yields \u201cS-curves\u201d (dashed lines), with their maximal difference indicating a single-shot fidelity of 87\n(c) Measurement fidelity versus integration time.  Integrating $V_{\\mathrm{H}}(t)$ for 120\u00a0ns yields 80\n\nThis behavior can be used to realize a high-fidelity qubit measurement because of a qubit-state-dependent bright-state onset power.  When driving with sufficiently high power at $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$, the system will excite to its bright state and remain there as long as the drive is applied.  Crucially, however, the lowest power for which the system will excite depends strongly on the qubit state because the cavity is dispersively shifted closer to $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$ when the qubit is excited [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:pspec1q)(g)].  This smaller detuning reduces the Lorentzian filtering effect of the cavity at $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$, lowering the onset power.  The cavity response at $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$ thus undergoes a sharp step for increasing drive at a power depending on the qubit state [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:pspec1q)(h)].  This transition does not happen discontinuously; there are powers where the system will only excite some of the time.  A high-discrimination readout is then made by choosing a drive power $P_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ that maximizes the difference in bright-state probability for the qubit ground and excited states, generating a large state-dependent transmission difference [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:hist1q)(a)].  For measurements of the $8\\ghz$ qubit, the optimal power is $P_{\\mathrm{meas}} \\approx +47~\\mathrm{dB}$.\n\nWe determine the readout measurement fidelity by comparing the ensemble distribution of cavity responses having prepared the qubit ground and excited states.  This is done by integrating $\\sim500,000$ (in this case) individual measurement transients such as those shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:hist1q)(a) for $500~\\mathrm{ns}$ for both qubit preparations and plotting their distribution [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:hist1q)(b)].  For the qubit at $8\\ghz$, the maximal separation between the normalized integral of these histograms indicates a measurement fidelity of 87\n\nTwo important considerations for qubit readout are measurement time and repetition rate.  Single-shot fidelity as a function of integration time is shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:hist1q)(c).  After 120\u00a0ns the fidelity has risen to 80\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nJoint qubit readout.\n(a) Pulsed cavity response $\\overline{A_{\\mathrm{H}}}$ when preparing the $\\bra{111}$ state.  The eight ($2^3$) register states of three qubits induce a different dispersive cavity shift, each discernible at low power due to decay of the $\\bra{111}$ state during measurement.  These frequencies were independently measured to be $( f_{\\bra{000}}, f_{\\bra{100}}, f_{\\bra{010}}, f_{\\bra{001}}, f_{\\bra{110}}, f_{\\bra{101}}, f_{\\bra{011}}, f_{\\bra{111}} ) = ( 9.145, 9.139, 9.131, 9.112, 9.124, 9.105, 9.097, 9.090 )~\\mathrm{GHz}$, with $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}=9.070\\ghz$.  The most prominent secondary cavity position corresponds to the third qubit (at $8\\ghz$) relaxing during measurement, consistent with its Purcell-limited [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] $T_{\\mathrm{1}}$ being shortest of the three, with $T_{\\mathrm{1}}^{\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{1}}}= 1.2 ~\\mu \\mathrm{s}$, $T_{\\mathrm{1}}^{\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{2}}}= 1.0 ~\\mu \\mathrm{s}$, and $T_{\\mathrm{1}}^{\\mathrm{Q}_{\\mathrm{3}}}= 0.6 ~\\mu \\mathrm{s}$.  The system excites to its bright state at lower power here than seen in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:pspec1q) because of the smaller initial cavity detuning from $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$.  The color scale is identical to that in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:pspec1q).\n(b) Histograms for all eight basis states, when driving with +49\u00a0dB at $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$.\n(c) S-curves for joint qubit readout, indicating a minimum of 61\n\nWe have extended this readout scheme to the joint readout of three qubits.  The physics of multiqubit readout are similar to the solitary case, but generalized for the eight zero-power cavity frequencies possible with three qubits.  Each basis state induces a different dispersive cavity shift from $f_{\\mathrm{bare}}$, yielding a hierarchy of powers for the onset of the bright state.  Readout is done by choosing a measurement power above the onset power for all but the state one is trying to detect.  We consider the register of three qubits at frequencies $(6,7,8)\\ghz$, with the fourth qubit unused.  For these detunings, $P_{\\mathrm{joint}} \\approx 49~\\mathrm{dB}$ is optimal for distinguishing $\\bra{000}$ from all other basis states (including second excited states).  This scheme is especially convenient for performing qubit tomography, which involves measuring multiqubit correlations [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and is done efficiently with a joint qubit measurement [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  Indeed, the creation and detection of tripartite entanglement was recently demonstrated using this device and readout scheme [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  Cavity transmission for the prepared excited states of all three qubits is shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:pspec3q)(a).\n\nThe joint fidelity is quantified in a similar manner as for one qubit, but expanded for the eight qubit basis states [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:pspec3q)(b)].  As there is no established definition of joint qubit readout fidelity, we propose a conservative metric: the maximal separation between the S-curves for the state one is trying to detect and the least distinguishable state.  This standard yields a fidelity of 61\n\nThis measurement scheme, which we name the Jaynes-Cummings readout, provides high-fidelity single-shot qubit measurement in cQED while being simple, relatively insensitive to qubit detuning, and not requiring any change in experimental setup or sample design.  It works by combining the occupation-dependent Jaynes-Cummings anharmonicity [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] with the qubit-state-dependent dispersive cavity shift to conditionally drive the system to a high-transmission bright state, in analogy to the fluorescence readout scheme used in ion traps [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  The effect has also delivered similar performance in a Purcell-filtered [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] low-Q cavity coupled to a single transmon, suggesting that it is also robust to cavity lifetime.  It may also be extendable to other cQED architectures, not just those using transmons [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  We do not expect it to be quantum nondemolition due to dressed dephasing [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] of the qubit from the substantial photon population, but this is not necessary for many applications.  Future work will further optimize the readout scheme by changing sample design parameters.  A scheme may be possible where all qubit states are measured in a single shot by sweeping the measurement tone power and frequency or by using an intermediate power where the transition rate for each basis state is substantially different.\n\nWe thank L.\u00a0S.\u00a0Bishop, E.\u00a0Ginossar, M.\u00a0H.\u00a0Devoret, and S.\u00a0M.\u00a0Girvin for discussions and M.\u00a0Brink for experimental contributions.

In particular, they do not involve an anyhow characterized separate quantum measurement apparatus.\nThe third object, is the classical processor, a classical computing device, that\nmight take care of potentially required pre- and post-processing tasks for the device control\nand the processing of the output data to arrive at a certificate or even\ncommunicates with the device and measurement apparatus in multiple rounds of an interactive protocol.\n\nThe landscape of protocols can be roughly organized according to three `axes'.\nThe first axis comprises the set of assumptions that are imposed on the device and measurement apparatus to guarantee the functioning of\nthe protocol.\n\nA second axis summarizes the complexity of the resources that the protocol consumes.\nEach protocol requires\na certain number of different measurement settings, its measurement complexity, that each require the implementation of\nmeasurements that involve a certain quantum measurement complexity.\nTo arrive at a final statistical estimate, a total number of repetitions of device invocations are required, the scaling of which is referred to as the sample complexity.\nFurthermore, as we already highlighted at the beginning, a particularly important figure of merit\nfor a protocol is that it comes with practically manageable demands in space and time for the classical processing tasks, its classical processing complexity.\nFor our present scope, the mentioned complexity categories are the most important and are in the focus of our discussion.\nNote, however, that this list is by far not complete, for example, interactive protocols might be compared in terms of challenging demands in the timing of the device's control.\n\nThe third and final axis is the information gain of the protocol.\nAt a first glimpse this might come as a surprise as a protocol that outputs `accept' or `reject' might\nbe regarded as always providing one bit of information.\nBut different measures of quality have different discriminatory power among the hypothesis class that models the device\ncompatible with the protocol's set of assumptions.\nFor example, let us imagine a device preparing quantum states on demand.\nWe might require the device to produce a quantum state that is $\\epsilon$-close in some distance measure to a specific target state.\nAn alternative specification of the device might require it to always output the same quantum state but this quantum state should only be within a specified set of quantum states.\nIn this situation, we can roughly say that the information gain restricting the device (within its allowed hypothesis class) is higher in the first specification compared to the latter one.\n\nConcomitant with less information gain, it is conceivable that one can design a protocol for the latter specification with\nsignificantly less complexity compared to the first specification.\nAnalyzing the information gain in performing a certification task often allows one to derive lower bounds on the complexity of any protocol for this task.\nBeside the discriminatory power of the measure of quality, other intermediate steps in the certification protocol can reveal significantly more information about the device than is ultimately reflected in the measure of quality and the final certificate.\nFor example, a potential certification protocol for our device that prepares quantum states might perform a high-precision, complete tomographic reconstruction of the quantum state and subsequently calculate the measure of quality using the tomographic estimate together with its error bounds.\nConceptually, this example illustrates that certification is a subtask of the broader task of quantum system characterization, that encompasses protocols aiming at different types of information about a quantum system, e.g., identification of a quantum system or testing for a specific property.\nProtocols that perform quantum system identification or property estimation naturally also give rise to certification protocols.\nNote that in practice, the hidden information gain of a certification protocol can provide valuable information to calibrate and improve the device.\n\nAnother related task in quantum system characterization is the benchmarking of quantum devices.\nBenchmarking aims at comparing the performance of multiple devices.\nThis can be done by comparing the achievable $\\epsilon$-value of $\\epsilon$-certificates of the respective devices.\nBenchmarking especially provides pragmatic impetus towards measures of quality that are not directly\ninterpretable on the physical layer.\nInstead, for the benchmarking of quantum devices it suffices to implicitly define a reproducible performance measure\nby specifying a protocol that returns the measure.\nThe only required justification is that the measure\nis expected to be correlated with the performance in practically relevant tasks."}

{"prompt": "Explain the '## Quantum simulation and algorithm demonstrations using' section of the paper.", "completion": "As an example of the utility of the  gate, we briefly discuss a particular demonstration of a digital quantum simulation. In this context, the  gate has been utilized to simulate a two-site Hubbard model with four fermionic modes, using four qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], it is possible to map fermionic operators onto Pauli spin matrices[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. As shown in Ref.Barends2015 a Hubbard model with two fermionic modes, whose Hamiltonian is given by\n$$\n\nH_\\text{Hubbard, two mode} = -t (b^\\dagger_1b_2 + b_2^\\dagger b_1) + U b^\\dagger_1b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_1 b^\\dagger_2b^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_2\n\n$$\ncan be written in terms of Pauli operators as,\n$$\n\nH & = \\frac{t}{2}\\left(\\sigma_x \\otimes \\sigma_x+\\sigma_y\\otimes\\sigma_y\\right)\n\\\\\n& + \\frac{U}{4}\\left(\\sigma_z\\otimes\\sigma_z + \\sigma_z\\otimes \\Id + \\Id \\otimes \\sigma_z\\right),\n\n$$\nwhere $U$ is the repulsion energy and $t$ is the hopping strength.

We refer the interested reader to two reviews on quantum simulations, see e.g. Refs. Buluta2009,Georgescu2014.\n\nThe  gate has also been used in a variety of other contexts, e.g., for calculating the dissociation of diatomic hydrogen ($H_2$) using the variational quantum eigensolver method[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], for feed-forward based teleportation experiments[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], as well as initial steps towards demonstrating quantum supremacy[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and a $2\\times 2$ implementation of the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In the field of hybrid semiconducting nanowire/superconducting qubits (known as the \u201cgatemon\" approach[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]), where the qubit frequency is modified by electrostatically changing the density of carriers in a semiconducting region with proximity-induced superconductivity, the  gate was also demonstrated between two nanowire qubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nOne may worry that operating a qubit by moving its frequency can lead to overlap with frequencies already used by other qubits, in a system with multiple qubits. This issue is known as frequency crowding. While the use of asymmetric transmons (with two sweet spots in the range $[-\\Phi_0,+\\Phi_0]$, recall <ref>(c)) may help alleviate some frequency crowding issues, a more long-term strategy is needed. One way to circumvent the problem is to utilize on/off tunable coupling schemes, in which qubits can exchange energy only if a coupler activates the interaction[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. To address this issue in the context of the  gate, Chen [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] demonstrated a device (named \u201cthe gmon\") where the qubit interaction can be tuned with an on/off ratio on the order of 1000, and a  gate fidelity of $\\mathcal F = 0.9907$ was demonstrated.\n\nThis concludes the introduction to the physics and operation of the  gate in its native form. In the remainder of this section we will introduce a few of the microwave-only gates that have been demonstrated in an effort to sidestep the need for local tunability (and the resulting increased sensitivity to noise) as required by the  and  gate.\n\nTwo-qubit gates using only microwaves\n\nOne common (potential) drawback for the  and  gates is that their operation requires flux-tunable qubits. Introducing a new control knob, such as flux control, in turn also introduces a new noise channel for the system. Furthermore, the need for flux-tunability increases the sensitivity of the devices to flux noise by tuning the qubits from their \u201csweet spots\", increases the dephasing rate. From this perspective, one could envision using all-microwave-based gates to remedy these issues. To this end, the cross-resonance (\u201c\") gate was developed for operating fixed-frequency superconducting qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which typically feature longer lifetimes and reduced sensitivity to flux noise.\n\nThe operational principle of the  gate\n\nTo elucidate the operation of the  gate, we briefly revisit the driving Hamiltonian derived in Sec. <ref>. There, we considered only a single qubit. However, if one extends this formalism to two qubits, see Fig. (Figure fig:2qb_CR)(a) denoting the frequency difference by $\\Delta_{12} = \\omega_{\\text{q}1} - \\omega_{\\text{q}2}$ and the coupling by $g\\ll \\Delta_{12}$, and performing a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to go to the dressed state picture, the driving Hamiltonians for qubit 1 and 2 become[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n$$\n\nH_{\\d,1} = \\Omega V_{\\d1}(t)\\left(\\sigma_x\\otimes\\Id + \\nu_1^-\\Id\\otimes\\sigma_x + \\mu_1^{-}\\sigma_z\\otimes\\sigma_x\\right)\\label{eq:CRGambettaStyle}\\\\\nH_{\\d,2} = \\Omega V_{\\d2}(t)\\left(\\Id\\otimes\\sigma_x + \\nu_2^+\\sigma_x\\otimes\\Id + \\mu_2^{+}\\sigma_x\\otimes\\sigma_z\\right)\n\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\n\\mu_i^\\pm &= \\pm\\frac{g}{\\Delta_{12}}\\frac{\\alpha_i}{(\\alpha_i \\mp \\Delta_{12})} \\label{eq:muforCR1}\\\\\n\\nu_i^\\pm &= \\pm\\frac{g}{\\Delta_{12}}\\frac{\\mp \\Delta_{12}}{(\\alpha_i \\mp \\Delta_{12})}\n\n$$\nand $\\Omega V_{\\text{d}i}(t)$ is the driving for qubit $i$. From <ref>, it is evident that if we drive qubit 1 at the frequency of qubit 2, then to qubit 2, this will look like a combination of $\\nu_1^-\\Id\\otimes\\sigma_x$ and $\\mu_1^-\\sigma_z\\otimes\\sigma_x$. This means that the Rabi oscillations of qubit 2 will have a frequency given by\n$$\n\n\\Omega^\\text{Rabi}_{\\text{QB2}} = \\Omega V_{\\text{d}1}\\left(\\nu_1^- + z_1 \\mu_1^-\\right), \\label{eq:CR_rabi}\n\n$$\nwhere $z_1=\\langle\\sigma_z \\Id\\rangle$, and $z_1$ depends on the state of qubit 1. This effect is demonstrated in <ref>(c), where a simulated drive is applied to qubit 1 while the resulting Rabi oscillations in qubit 2 are recorded. We have used typical fixed-frequency transmon parameters from experiments, and we have included a spurious cross-talk term $\\eta = 0.03$.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In <ref>(d), we plot the difference in angle in the $(z,y)$ plane acquired by qubit 2 for different initializations of qubit 1, $\\Delta \\phi = \\phi_{|00\\rangle}^{zy} - \\phi_{|10\\rangle}^{zy}$. For this particular choice of parameters, the cross-resonance gate achieves a $\\pi$-phase shift in $\\approx 200~$ns.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Schematic circuit diagram of two fixed frequency transmons coupled through a resonator yielding an overall coupling coefficient $g$. Qubit 1 driven at the frequency of qubit 2 leads to the  gate.

(d) Difference in angle in the $(z,y)$ plane as a function of length of the applied drive to qubit 1. At approximately 200\u00a0ns $\\pi$-phase shift has been acquired.\n\nThis strategy was first demonstrated using flux-tunable transmons in Ref.Chow2011, where a Bell state with fidelity $\\mathcal F_\\text{bell} = \\langle \\Phi^+|\\rho|\\Phi^+\\rangle = 0.90$ was achieved. Using quantum process tomography the gate fidelity was found to be $\\mathcal F_\\text{QPT} = 0.81$. By moving to fixed-frequency qubits with increased lifetimes, the gate fidelity was increased to $\\mathcal F_\\text{QPT} = 0.98$ (with subtraction of state initialization and measurement errors)[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For completeness, we note that due to the form of the last term in <ref>, the  gate is also sometimes denoted the $\\textsf{ZX}_{\\theta}$ gate.

The effect of both the spurious ac Stark shift and the direct $\\nu_1^-\\Id\\sigma_x$ single-qubit rotations was studied in Ref.Corcoles2013. By modifying the original $\\CR{}$ protocol to effectively \u201cecho away\" the two unwanted contributions from the $\\sigma_z\\Id$ and $\\Id\\sigma_x$ terms, the fidelity of the  gate was improved to $\\mathcal F_\\text{CR} = 0.8799$[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], using quantum process tomography. Using interleaved randomized benchmarking of this improved \u201cecho-CR\"-gate (e$\\ZX{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$), a gate fidelity of $\\mathcal F_{\\text{e}\\ZX{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}} = 0.9347$ was achieved. This gate implementation was used to demonstrate two-qubit parity measurements in a three-qubit device[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], as well as detecting bit-flip and phase-flip errors in a Bell state encoded in a four-qubit device[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], with gate fidelities from interleaved randomized benchmarking in the range 0.94 to 0.96. Using a similar device, but with five qubits, weight-four parity measurement of the forms $ZZZZ$ and $XXXX$ were demonstrated[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where the crosstalk to qubits not involved in the  gates was studied, leading to the development of a four pulse $\\text{e}\\CR_{\\text{4-pulse}}$ scheme.\n\nBased on improvements in the analysis of the Hamiltonian describing the  drive, Sheldon [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] subsequently demonstrated a version of the  which reduced the gate time to $\\tau = 160$ ns and added an active cancellation tone to the e$\\ZX{}$ previously developed. Using this \u201cactive cancellation echo $\\ZX{}$\" (ace$\\ZX{}$), the fidelity was increased to $\\mathcal F_{\\text{ace}\\ZX{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}} = 0.991$, measured with interleaved randomized benchmarking. The same sequence without active cancellation on the same qubits yielded $\\mathcal F_{\\text{e}\\ZX{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}} = 0.948$. The interested reader may consult the followup theoretical work [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] with more details on the effective Hamiltonian models. Other approaches to fast, high-fidelity cross-resonance gates have also been proposed [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This series of improvements to the original cross-resonance implementation has increased the gate fidelity to beyond the threshold for fault-tolerance in a surface code, with similar quality to the  gate. Although improvements should still be made, with the advent of the  gate, superconducting qubit based quantum computing platforms now offer two entangling two-qubit gates that can be used for implementing surface-code based error correction schemes.\n\nIn the initial experiments using  gates, the gate times were significantly longer than the typical  gate times ($\\tau_{\\CPHASE{}}=30$ \u2013 60 ns and $\\tau_{\\CR} = 300$ \u2013 400 ns), which to a large extent accounts for the observed  gate fidelities. The time scale for  operation is set by the frequency detuning, the anharmonicity, and the coupling strength, through <ref>. This has the unfortunate drawback that if qubits do not have intended frequencies (due to fabrication variation), it will be immediately manifest as longer gate times, and in turn, reduced gate fidelity. As fabrication techniques are becoming more sophisticated and reliable, this problem may be of reduced importance. However, since the coupling in the  scheme is always on, there is an inherent tension between well-isolated qubits for high-fidelity single-qubit operations, and coupling qubits, for fast/high-fidelity two qubit gates.\n\nQuantum simulation and algorithm demonstrations with the  gate\n\nSince the form of the  Hamiltonian ($\\sigma_z\\otimes\\sigma_x$) is not a $(\\sigma_x\\otimes\\sigma_x + \\sigma_y\\otimes \\sigma_y)$-type interaction (leading to  gate) nor is it an the effective $(\\sigma_z\\otimes\\sigma_z)$-type (leading to  gate), one could question its applicability to quantum-simulation-type experiments, which often involves terms of the form $\\sigma_i\\otimes\\sigma_i$. However, by developing a variational quantum eigensolver routine that efficiently generates entangled trial states using just the $\\ZX{}$ interaction, Kandala [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] calculated the ground-state energy for H$_2$, LiH, and BeH$_2$. This experiment was performed on six fixed-frequency qubits, and it employed a technique for compact encoding of the Hamiltonians corresponding to each molecule[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. As of this writing, this experiment represents the largest molecule for which the ground state has been found using a purely quantum processing approach.\n\nThe  gate is also the native two-qubit gate available on the IBM Quantum Experience quantum processor[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which is accesible online. Using the IBM Quantum Experience processor, Takita [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] demonstrated an implementation of a two-logical-qubit (four physical qubit) error detection code [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The implementation was inspired by the proposal of Gottesman[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which proposed a minimal experiment to claim observation of fault-tolerant encodings[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], using a four qubit error detection code in a five qubit setup. Due to constraints on the connectivity, the work by Takita  demonstrated a modified version of the Gottesman encoding, in which two logical qubits are initialized, but only one of them in a fault-tolerant manner. By artificially injecting an error in the state preparation circuit, the authors demonstrate that the probability of correctly preparing a fault tolerant state is greater than the probability of correctly preparing a non-fault-tolerant qubit. This behavior is consistent with expectations for how fault-tolerant encodings work. Simultaneously, Vuillot[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] also used the IBM Quantum Experience machine to study fault-tolerant schemes encoded in that connectivity.\n\nBeyond the applications to error-correction and error-detection, the cross-resonance gate has also been employed in early demonstrations of quantum advantages in machine learning. Rist\u00e9 [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] studied the so-called \u201clearning parity with noise\" problem, in which one attempts to learn a bit-string  by querying an oracle function $f(\\textsf{\\textbf{D}},\\textsf{\\textbf{k}}) = \\textsf{\\textbf{D}}\\cdot\\textsf{\\textbf{k}}\\text{ mod }2$ with a user-input bit-string . In a first implementation of this problem, the authors show that for a specific instance of the bit-string $\\textsf{\\textbf{k}} = \\textsf{11}$, a learner with access to quantum operations needs fewer queries to the function $f$. However, by extending the model of learning parity with noise, the authors demonstrated a consistent advantage of the learner with access to quantum operations[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe  gate was also used to demonstrate the implementation of a supervised learning algorithm where the feature space is encoded as quantum data on the Bloch sphere[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In typical supervised learning, an algorithm is exposed to a training set of labeled data, and is subsequently asked to classify a new, unlabeled set of data[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In the support vector machine (SVM) approach to such problems, the data is then mapped non-linearly onto the so-called \u201cfeature space\", in which the trained algorithm has constructed a separating hyperplane to classify the data. While a full \u201cquantum Support Vector Machine\" proposal exists, the algorithm assumes that the data are already present in a coherent superposition[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Instead, Havlicek [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] proposed, and demonstrated, that mapping the classical data non-linearly onto the Bloch sphere can also be utilized to provide a quantum advantage. For a wider discussion of the important role of quantum data in many quantum machine learning algorithms, the reader is referred to Ref.Biamonte2017\n\nOther microwave-only gates: b, , and\n\nThe  gate (as outlined above) is not the only all-microwave two-qubit gate available. In particular, the  gate[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is an interesting alternative. The  gate directly drives the $|00\\rangle\\leftrightarrow|11\\rangle$ transition, made possible by interactions with the higher levels of the qubit, see Fig. (Figure fig:2qb_GatesLevelDiagram). Usually, the matrix element for such a transition is small (3rd order in the coupling strength), but if the detuning between the qubits is equal to the anharmonicity, the transition rate is enhanced. Applying a sequence of Schrieffer-Wolff transformations to the coupled-qubit system, and using a carefully chosen drive frequency (close to the midpoint of $\\omega_\\text{q1}$ and $\\omega_\\text{q2}$), it can be shown[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] that the drive gives rise to a unitary operator\n$$\n\nU = U_{\\bSWAP{}}(\\theta,\\phi)U_{ZZ}U_{IZ-ZI} \\label{eq:Ub}\n\n$$\nwith\n$$\n\nU_{\\bSWAP{}}(\\theta,\\phi) = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos \\theta & 0 & 0 & -ie^{-i2\\phi}\\sin\\theta\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n-ie^{-i2\\phi}\\sin\\theta & 0 & 0 & \\cos \\theta\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\label{eq:UbSWAP}\n\n$$\nThe two unitaries $U_{ZZ}$ and $U_{IZ-ZI}$ only contain terms that commute with $U_{\\bSWAP{}}(\\theta,\\phi)$, and their effects can be offset in post-processing[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In <ref>, $\\phi$ is the phase of the drive relative to the single-qubit drive pulses, and $\\theta = \\Omega_B t$ with\n$$\n\n\\Omega_B = \\frac{-2g\\Omega^2\\left(-g \\gamma \\alpha_\\Sigma+\\gamma^2\\alpha_2(\\alpha_1+\\Delta_{12}) + \\alpha_1(\\alpha_2-\\Delta_{12})\\right)}{(\\alpha_1+\\Delta_{12})(\\alpha_2 -\\Delta_{12})\\Delta_{12}^2},\n\n$$\nwhere $\\Omega$ is the amplitude of the drive, $\\gamma$ is a dimensionless parameter quantifying the coupling coefficient of the drive to qubit 2 in units of coupling strength to qubit 1, and $\\alpha_\\Sigma = \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2$. Explicit derivations leading to <ref> can be found in the supplement of Ref.Poletto2012. By applying $U_{\\bSWAP{}}$ for a time that yields $\\theta = \\pi/2$, and with $\\phi = 0$, the resulting gate is denoted  and can act as the entangling gate (together with single-qubit gates) that forms a universal gate set. Moreover, the power of the  becomes apparent when one applies it for the time that yields $\\theta = \\pi/4$, which from the ground state $|00\\rangle$ directly produces the entangled Bell state $|00\\rangle + e^{i\\phi}|11\\rangle$. In line with the definition of $\\sqrt{\\iSWAP{}}$, this gate is denoted the $\\sqrt{\\bSWAP{}}$. In the work by Poletto [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the fidelity of the  gate was $\\mathcal F_{\\bSWAP{}} = 0.9$ (determined from quantum process tomography). The main source of error was the increased dephasing during the relatively long high-power pulse needed to drive the $|00\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |11\\rangle$ transition. The  gate can be viewed as the superconducting qubit analogue of the M\u00f8lmer\u2013S\u00f8rensen gate [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In <ref>, we outline the level diagram of two coupled qubits, along with the higher levels of the qubits. The arrows indicate which coupled states are utilized to implement the corresponding gate. As an application of the  gate, Colless [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] used this gate to calculate energies of the excited states of a $H_2$ molecule using a two-qubit transmon processor [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic of the level structure of two coupled qubits (including higher levels) with indication of the transitions utilized in the , ,  and  gate. See text for details. Figure inspired from Ref. Chow2013.\n\nAnother all-microwave gate is the so-called \"microwave-activated \" (or `' for short)[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The  gate is in spirit similar to the  gate, where noncomputational states are used to impact a conditional phase inside the computational subspace. In contrast to , the  gate is implemented without tuning individual qubit frequencies. Rather, the canonical implementation of this gate comprises two fixed-frequency qubits, where the frequencies are carefully designed (and fabricated), such that the $|12\\rangle$ and $|03\\rangle$ levels are resonant. This leads to a splitting of the otherwise degenerate $|02\\rangle\\leftrightarrow|01\\rangle$, and $|12\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |11\\rangle$ transitions. By driving near resonance with the $|n2\\rangle\\leftrightarrow |n1\\rangle$ transition, an effective $\\sigma_z\\otimes \\sigma_z$ interaction is generated. In a setup comprising two fixed-frequency qubits, the  gate was used to implement the unitary\n$$\n\nU_\\textsf{MAP} = \\exp\\left[-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\sigma_z\\otimes \\sigma_z\\right],\n\n$$\nwith a gate fidelity $\\mathcal F_\\textsf{MAP} = 0.87$ (determined via quantum process tomography) in a time $\\tau_\\textsf{MAP} = 514~$ns[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. As the number of qubits in a system increase, one drawback of this gate is the need for a precise matching of higher energy levels across multiple qubits, while simultaneously avoiding spurious couplings to other modes in the system.\n\nThe ,  and  gates all have quite stringent requirements on the spectral landscape of the qubits in order to obtain fast, efficient gate operation. To address this issue, another all-microwave gate was developed, the so-called \u201cresonator induced phase gate\" (\u201c\")[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The  gate operates by coupling two fixed-frequency qubits to a bus cavity, from which they are far detuned. By adiabatically applying and removing an off-resonant pulse to the cavity, the system undergoes a closed loop in phase space, after which the cavity is left unchanged, but the qubits acquire a state-dependent phase. By a careful choice of the amplitude and detuning of the pulse, and taking into account the dispersive shift of the cavity, a  gate can be implemented on the two qubits. This effect was experimentally demonstrated by Paik [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] in a 3D transmon system[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where four qubits are coupled to the same bus. In this setup, the  gate operation results in unitaries with weight on all four qubits simultaenously. In order to isolate just the desired two-qubit coupling terms, Paik   developed a \u201crefocused\"  (r) gate that implements\n$$\n\nU_\\textsf{rRIP} = \\exp\\left[-i \\dot \\theta \\sigma_z \\otimes \\sigma_z t\\right],\n\n$$\nwhere the coupling rate (for an unmodulated drive) scales as\n$$\n\n\\dot \\theta \\propto \\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{|\\Omega V_\\d|}{2\\Delta_\\text{cd}}\\right)^2}_{\\bar n} \\frac{\\chi}{\\Delta_\\text{cd}},\n\n$$\nwhere $\\bar n$ denotes the average number of photons in the bus, $\\chi$ is the dispersive shift, and $\\Delta_\\text{cd}$ is the detuning of the drive (d) from the cavity (c). By choosing $\\dot \\theta t = \\pi/4$, it is possible to implement the $\\CPHASE{}$ gate. The power of the  gate lies in its capability to accommodate large differences in qubit frequencies. To demonstrate this, Paik [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] performed two-qubit randomized benchmarking between pairs of qubits in a four-qubit device with frequency differences spanning $0.38$\u00a0GHz to $1.8$\u00a0GHz, all with fidelities in the range 0.96-0.98 and gate times in the range 285 to 760 ns.\n\nGate implementations with tunable coupling\n\nFinally, we briefly review tunable coupling architectures, which have recently emerged as a promising alternative. The idea is to engineer an effective qubit-qubit coupling $\\widetilde g$ that is tunable (typically by applying a flux), and such gates are referred to as parametric gates. This can be implemented in two different ways: ($i$) The coupling strength between two qubits is tuned by a flux, $g\\rightarrow g(\\Phi(t))$[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], or ($ii$) the resonant frequency of the coupling element is modified $\\omega_\\text{coupler} \\rightarrow\\omega_\\text{coupler}(\\Phi(t))$[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], with a fixed g, leading to an effective time-dependent coupling parameter. When the tunable coupling element is driven at frequencies corresponding to the detuning of the qubits from the coupler, an entangling gate can be implemented.\n\nIn a setup of type $(ii)$, an implementation of the  gate was demonstrated by parametrically driving a flux-tunable coupler between two fixed-frequency qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], yielding a fidelity $\\mathcal F_{\\iSWAP{}} = 0.9823$ (using interleaved randomized benchmarking) in a time $\\tau = 183$\u00a0ns. Similarly, the  (and ) gates were recently demonstrated, using a flux-tunable transmon connecting two fixed-frequency transmons. Driving the flux through the tunable qubit at the sum frequency of the fixed-frequency transmons results in the [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] gate. This parametrically driven approach is generally significantly faster than implementations relying solely on fixed-frequency qubits.\n\nA hybrid approach, in which a combination of tunable and fixed-frequency qubits is used, was recently demonstrated for both  and  gates [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This scheme has no added tunable qubits (or resonators) acting as the coupling element, but rather, relies solely on an always-on capacitive coupling between the qubits, and the effective coupling is roughly half that of the always-on coupling. The operational principle here is to modulate the frequency of the tunable qubit (using local flux control) at the transition frequency correponding to $|01\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |10\\rangle$ for  and $|11\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |02\\rangle$ for . Using interleaved randomized benchmarking, the authors demonstrated $\\mathcal F_{\\iSWAP{}} = 0.94$ ($\\tau = 150$\u00a0ns), and $\\mathcal F^{02}_{\\CPHASE{}} = 0.93$ ($\\tau = 210$\u00a0ns) and $\\mathcal F^{20}_{\\CPHASE{}} = 0.88$ ($\\tau = 290$\u00a0ns), showing a slight asymmetry in the direction in which the  is applied. This hybrid technique was used in Ref.Reagor2018 to demonstrate a four-qubit GHZ state with fidelity $\\mathcal F_\\text{4 qubit GHZ} = 0.79$ (using state tomography). Finally, this gate-architecture was used to demonstrate a hybrid quantum/classical implementation of an unsupervised learning task (determining clustering of data), using nineteen qubits and supplemented by a classical computer as part of the minimization loop [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nQUBIT READOUT\n\nThe ability to perform fast and reliable (high fidelity) readout of the qubit states is an important cornerstone of any quantum processor[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn this section, we give a brief introduction to how readout is performed on superconducting qubits. We start by reviewing the fundamental theory behind dispersive readout \u2013 the most common readout technique used today in the circuit QED architecture \u2013 in which each qubit is coupled to a readout resonator. In the dispersive regime, i.e. when the qubit is detuned from the resonator frequency, the qubit induces a state-dependent frequency shift of the resonator from which the qubit state can be inferred by interrogating the resonator.\n\nDispersive readout allows us to map the quantum degree of freedom of the qubit onto the classical response of the linear resonator, thus transforming the readout optimization process into obtaining the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the microwave signal used to probe the resonator.\n\nWe then provide guidance on how to optimize system parameters to perform high-fidelity, single-shot readout. After choosing parameters, such as resonant frequencies and coupling rates, we address the filter and amplifier circuitry positioned in-between the qubit plane and the data aquisition hardware outside of the dilution refriderator. On this note, we review the basic principles of Purcell filters as well as parametric amplifiers, both of which are necessary to obtain fast, high-fidelity readout in scaled-up quantum processors."}

(e) A QEC protocol realized by mapping the parity of the logical qubit onto the state of the transmon, followed by the appropriate correction unitary.

Endowed with both low intrinsic decoherence rates and large Hilbert space for compact information storage, these cavities can play the role of a coherent quantum memory in cQED systems. In recent years, they have also been frequently employed for encoding logical qubits. More detailed discussions about the developments on this front are presented in Sec.\u00a0<ref>.2.\n\nHere, let us focus on the techniques for characterizing both the Hamiltonian and coherence properties of such high-Q superconducting cavities, as well as the tomography of the quantum states stored in them. The typical workflow for the characterization of the cavity is described in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cav_tuneup)a.\n\nA typical 3D cQED unit consisting of a storage cavity, a readout cavity, and a transmon qubit dispersively coupled to the storage\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is depicted in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cav_tuneup)(d). The transmon affords universal control of the storage cavity, allowing effective characterization the cavity by mapping the property of interest onto a particular transmon state. The transmon state is subsequently extracted via the readout resonator as described in the standard dispersive readout configuration\u00a0<ref>.3.\n\nIn order to map the property of the cavity on the transmon state, conditional operations between the two elements are required. In particular, there are two crucial conditional operations in cQED deivces, both arise from the natural dispersive interaction between the transmon and cavity.\n\nThe first operation is a rotation on the transmon conditioned on a specific photon number in the cavity, $R_{\\theta}^{n}$, also commonly referred to as a photon number selective rotation. Here, $R$ is a rotation along either the $x$ or $y$ axis of the transmon Bloch sphere, $\\theta$ is the angle of the rotation, and $n$ refers to the photon number in the cavity. Under the dispersive interaction, the transmon frequency is naturally dependent on $n$. Hence, this conditional rotation is simply realized by using long, spectrally-selective drives with duration $\\tau>1/\\chi$ such that the transmon state is only affected when the cavity contains the correct photon number state.\n\nThe second conditional operation is a cavity-transmon conditional phase gate:\n$$\n\n\\mathbf{C}_\\Phi = \\mathcal{I} \\otimes \\ket{g}\\bra{g} + e^{i\\Phi\\mathbf{a}^\\dagger\\mathbf{a}}\\otimes\\ket{e}\\bra{e}\n\n$$\nThis C-Phase gate arises naturally during an idle time $t$, with $\\Phi=\\chi t$.\n\nEquipped with these two useful conditional operations between the cavity and the transmon ancilla, we now proceed to characterize the storage cavity. Similar to that for a transmon qubit, we start the characterization process of a high-Q cavity with a spectroscopy experiment that allows the extraction of its resonance frequency. In this case, a strong drive with variable frequencies is first applied on the cavity, followed by the $X_{\\pi}^{0}$ gate on the transmon ancilla. When the drive frequency on the cavity matches that of its resonance, the cavity is displaced far from the vacuum state. As a result, the transmon state will be unaffected by the selective $\\pi$ pulse. Hence, by measuring the resulting state of the transmon, we can extract the resonance frequency of the cavity.\n\nNext, we proceed to characterise the exact dispersive coupling strength, $\\chi$, via the number-splitting experiment\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The typical measurement procedure and outcome is shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cav_tuneup)b, where the transmon spectrum is probed after a large displacement on the cavity. The resulting frequency separations, which correspond to different photon number states in the cavity, indicate the value of $\\chi$.\n\nAnother useful technique to extract the value of $\\chi$ is a Ramsey-type measurement, commonly referred to as Ramsey revival. This experiment uses the coherent transmon precession, which depends on the cavity state, to probe the interaction strength between the two elements. It starts with an initial state $\\ket{\\psi(0)} = \\ket{\\beta}\\ket{g}$, followed by two transmon rotations, $Y_{\\pi/2}$, separated by a variable delay time.\n\nThe resulting evolution can be captured by measuring the state of the transmon ancilla, which is given by\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n$$\n\n%  P_e = \\frac{1}{2}\\{1 + e^{|\\beta|^2(\\cos{\\chi t}-1)}\\cos{(|\\beta|^2\\sin{\\chi t}})\\}.\nP_e = \\frac{1}{2}\\{1 + e^{-2|\\beta|^2\\sin^2(\\chi t/2)}\\cos{(|\\beta|^2\\sin{\\chi t}})\\}.\n\n$$\nFor a large coherent state $|\\beta|\\gg 1$, $P_e\\approx \\frac{1}{2}$ during most of the evolution time due to the entanglement of the cavity-transmon system, which results in an apparent mixed state when only the qubit is measured. However, at times $t = 2n\\pi/\\chi$ ($n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+$), the transmon and cavity are no longer entangled, resulting in a \u201crevival\" of the transmon excited state. Hence, the times at which such revival occurs provides a precise measure of $\\chi$.\n\nNext, let us consider the experimental process to extract the coherence times of the cavity. Analogous to the transmon qubits, the performance of a high-Q cavity can be captured by its $T_1$ and $T_2$ Ramsey times. These measurements often require the preparation of Fock states in the cavity. This can be implemented via numerically optimized drives, such as the selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP)\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] or optimal control theory gate (OCT)\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] gates.\n\nPhysically, the $T_1$ of a cavity indicates the photon-loss rate. This is measured using a simple protocol described in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cav_tuneup)(c), where we probe the probability of the cavity returning to its vacuum state from a large coherent state after a variable delay. Alternatively, cavity $T_1$ can also be extracted by measuring the time-scale over which it returns to vacuum from Fock state $|1\\rangle$.\n\nThe $T_2$ Ramsey time of an harmonic oscillator mode is defined as duration over which the phase between its lowest two energy levels can be coherently preserved. To probe this, we prepare a state along the equator of the pseudo-Bloch sphere of the resonator\u2019s subspace spanned by $\\{|0\\rangle, |1\\rangle\\}$ such as\n$$\n\n|\\psi_0\\rangle \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle).\n\n$$\nThe time evolution of this state is similar to that of a two-level system initialized on the equator of its Bloch sphere. After a variable wait time, we perform another displacement operation on the cavity such that the interference effect results in the cavity returning to $|0\\rangle$ if the initial phase of the prepared superposition state is unchanged. A comprehensive discussion of these protocols can be found in Chapter 6 of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nFinally, for any arbitrary state $\\ket\\psi$ in the storage cavity, we can also implement QND measurement of photon number parity with the protocol shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cav_tuneup)(e). In this process, the transmon is first rotated to the equator state $(\\ket{g}-\\ket{e})/\\sqrt{2}$ with a $Y_{\\pi/2}$ pulse. After an idle time of $t=\\pi/\\chi$, under the effect of the $\\mathbf{C}_\\Phi$ gate, the even-parity and odd-parity photon states accumulate phases of 0 and $\\pi$ (modulo 2 $\\pi$) respectively. After another transmon $Y_{\\pi/2}$ pulse, these unitary operations complete entanglement of the transmon with the parity operator of the cavity:\n$$\n\n\\ket{\\psi}\\otimes \\ket{g} \\longrightarrow \\mathbf{\\Pi_e}\\ket{\\psi}\\otimes\\ket{e} + \\mathbf{\\Pi_o}\\ket{\\psi}\\otimes\\ket{g}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{\\Pi_e}$ and $\\mathbf{\\Pi_o}$ are projectors to the even and odd parity subspace. Each single-shot QND measurement of the transmon state reveals the parity of the cavity state, which informs the binary status of \u201cerror\" or \u201cno-error\" on the logical qubit. Repetitive monitoring of the error syndrome using this technique was first demonstrated in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and was subsequently used in a growing number of bosonic QEC experiments\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nFurthermore, this Ramsey-style parity measurement protocol also allows to perform a direct measurement of the Wigner function of the cavity\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The value of the Wigner function at any point of the phase space is equal to the expectation value of the photon number parity after a displacement by $\\alpha$: $W(\\alpha) = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\mathrm{Tr}[\\bD_\\alpha^\\dagger\\rho\\bD_\\alpha\\mathbf{P}]$. The same technique has been further extended to perform joint photon parity measurements and joint Wigner tomography of two cavities\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]."}

This coupling has to be sufficiently small to prevent Purcell decay of the qubit into the transmission line [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The finite value of the coupling imposes a limit on the $T_1$ time of the qubit, which we target here to be no lower than $T_1^{\\rm lim}=0.5\\,$ms, significantly larger than state-of-the-art coherence times [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].

To achieve this value a peak power $P_{\\rm p}=\\hbar\\omega_q T_1^{\\rm lim}\\Omega_0^2/4\\approx -66\\,$dBm is needed [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].

This number will be further reduced due to a finite duty cycle of those pulses during the execution of a quantum algorithm. We assume a maximum duty cycle of 33\n\nReadout signals used to drive readout resonators to infer the state of qubits are typically an order of magnitude smaller and have a lower duty cycle. They are therefore not taken into account in our estimates.\n\nConcerning dissipation in flux lines, we primarily consider DC biasing currents, which are constantly applied to set the qubit frequency, in most of the cases to the so-called sweet spot frequency $\\omega_q=\\omega_0$, at which $\\omega_q$ is to first-order insensitive to flux noise [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Assuming a worst case scenario of random offset magnetic fields in the SQUID loops, the compensating flux $\\Phi_{\\rm offset}$ which we apply to reach the closest sweet spot, is equally distributed in the interval $[-\\Phi_0/2,\\Phi_0/2]$. This corresponds to a current interval of [-1,1] mA, when using a reasonable mutual inductance between flux line and SQUID loop of $M=\\partial\\Phi/\\partial I=0.5$ $\\Phi_0/{\\rm mA}$. The mutual inductance is determined by the coupling strength (proximity) of the on-chip flux line to the SQUID loop and the area of the SQUID loop. A large $M$ on the one hand minimizes the required current and thus dissipation in the line, and allows for the usage of low-noise current sources which typically have a small dynamic range. On the other hand, a large SQUID loop is also more susceptible to (external) magnetic flux noise, and care needs to be taken in the design of large coupling strengths in order to keep residual capacitive coupling of the qubit to the flux line low, which otherwise can limit the qubit lifetime due to the Purcell effect [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The dissipated heat due to the bias currents is most critical at the MXC stage because least cooling power is available there. The amount of dissipation\n\ndepends on the DC resistances of the stainless steel cable and low-pass filter installed between CP and MXC, and to which stage this dissipated heat predominantly flows to. We experimentally determine this heat load as discussed in Section <ref>.\n\nWe also consider dissipation due to flux pulses, which are used for the realization of two-qubit gates.

{"prompt": "Explain the 'Random quantum circuits' section of the paper.", "completion": "In each cycle of the random quantum circuit, single-qubit gates chosen randomly from $\\{\\sqrt X, \\sqrt Y, \\sqrt W \\}$ are first applied on all qubits, and then two-qubit gates, iSWAP-like gate, are applied to pairs of qubits. There are four types of patterns for two-qubit gate, labeled by A, B, C and D respectively, which determine which two-qubit gates are executed on each layer. Different from the single-qubit gates, the four patterns of A, B, C, and D are implemented in the sequence of ABCDCDAB.\n\nIn our experiments, we implement random quantum circuits (RQCs) on the quantum processor, and evaluate the time consumption of simulating these quantum circuits on the traditional supercomputer. So far, there are mainly two types of algorithms for simulating large RQCs: (1) tensor network algorithms\u00a0[Markov, Igor L, Shi, Yaoyun, \"Simulating quantum computation by contracting tensor networks\", 2008] [Guo, Chu, Liu, Yong, Xiong, Min, Xue, Shichuan, Fu, Xiang, Huang, Anqi, Qiang, Xiaogang, Xu, Ping, Liu, Junhua, Zheng, Shenggen, others, \"General-purpose quantum circuit simulator with projected entangled-pair states and the quantum supremacy frontier\", 2019] [Villalonga, Benjamin, Boixo, Sergio, Nelson, Bron, Henze, Christopher, Rieffel, Eleanor, Biswas, Rupak, Mandr\u00e0, Salvatore, \"A flexible high-performance simulator for verifying and benchmarking quantum circuits implemented on real hardware\", 2019] [Villalonga, Benjamin, Lyakh, Dmitry, Boixo, Sergio, Neven, Hartmut, Humble, Travis S, Biswas, Rupak, Rieffel, Eleanor G, Ho, Alan, Mandr\u00e0, Salvatore, \"Establishing the quantum supremacy frontier with a 281 pflop/s simulation\", 2020] [Huang, Cupjin, Zhang, Fang, Newman, Michael, Cai, Junjie, Gao, Xun, Tian, Zhengxiong, Wu, Junyin, Xu, Haihong, Yu, Huanjun, Yuan, Bo, others, \"Classical simulation of quantum supremacy circuits\", 2020] [Pan, Feng, Zhang, Pan, \"Simulating the Sycamore quantum supremacy circuits\", 2021] [Guo, Chu, Zhao, Youwei, Huang, He-Liang, \"Verifying Random Quantum Circuits with Arbitrary Geometry Using Tensor Network States Algorithm\", 2021] and (2) Schr\u00f6dinger-Feynman algorithm (SFA). The time-consuming of the SFA is significantly connected to the structure of four patterns A, B, C, and D, which could be regarded as a criteria for designing the structure of RQCs. The basic procedure of SFA can be summarized as follows: (1) Firstly, cut a $n$-qubit quantum circuit into two partitions with $n_1$ and $n_2$ qubits. (2) Then by summing all simulation paths that are the product of the terms of the Schmidt decomposition of all cross-partition gates, one could obtain the output state of the quantum circuit. The computational complexity of the algorithm is proportional to $(2^{n_1} + 2^{n_2})r^g$, where $r$ is the Schmidt rank, and $g$ is the number of the cross-partition gates. The iSWAP-like gate used in our scheme has the Schmidt rank of $r=4$. Thus, when evaluating the runtime of the SFA, one needs to find the optimal cut with $n_1$, $n_2$ and $g$ that makes the simulation task to become the easiest. In addition, for a circuit cut, if the following formations occur, both $r$ and $g$ may be reduced, resulting in a reduction in the computational complexity of the SFA algorithm:\n\n1) Wedge formation. As shown in Fig.\u00a0<ref>, a wedge formation is formed when two consecutive cross-partition gates share a qubit, which can reduce the Schmidt decomposition of resulting three-qubit unitary to only four terms. Equivalently, every wedge reduces a cross-partition gate, and provides a speedup of a factor of 4.\n\n2) DCD formation. The DCD formation often happens at the boundary. Specifically, the DCD formation appears when there are three successive two-qubit gates acting on the qubit pairs $(a,b)$, $(b,c)$ and $(a,b)$, and these three gates can be fused in one (the two gates on qubit pairs $(a,b)$ can be fused). A DCD formation provides a speedup of a factor of 4.\n\n3) Formation of iSWAP-like gates at the start and end of the circuit. The iSWAP-like gate is the product of a iSWAP and controlled phase gate, and the iSWAP gate can be applied either at the beginning or at the end of the sequence. We apply this transformation to all iSWAP-like gates at the beginning (end) of the circuit that affect qubits that are not affected by any other two-qubit gate before (after) in the circuit. The iSWAP is then applied to the input (output) qubits and their respective one-qubit gates trivially, and the bond dimension remaining from this iSWAP-like gate is 2, corresponding to a controlled phase gate, as opposed to the bond dimension 4 of the original iSWAP-like gate. Thus, A iSWAP-like gate that appears at the same time in the cross-partition and the beginning (or end) of the circuit can provide a speedup of a factor of 2.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nWedge formation. The gate highlighted in blue and green on the cut line are crosspartition gates. A wedge is formed when two consecutive crosspartition gates share a qubit.\n\nTo ensure the computational complexity and classical hardness with low depth, the number of cross-partition gates $g$ on the optimal cut should be large enough, and the four patterns should be carefully designed to avoid the occurrence of above three formations as much as possible.\n\nFigure\u00a0<ref>(a) shows an example of the topology of a quantum processor. The red dot represents the qubit, and the black line represents the two-qubit gate between two qubits. These two-qubit gates can be divided into two categories: ${G_{45^\\circ }}$ and ${G_{135^\\circ }}$, which are represented as 45 degree lines (see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b)) and 135 degree lines (see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(b)), respectively. For efficient implementation on the quantum hardware, every two different two-qubit gates in each pattern should not share the same qubit. Thus, pattern ${G_{45^\\circ }}$ is split into pattern A and pattern B (see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(c)). Similarly, pattern ${G_{135^\\circ }}$ is split into pattern C and pattern D (see Fig.\u00a0<ref>(d)). Patterns A, B, C, and D could have different structures, and once pattern A (or C) is determined, then the structure of pattern B (or D) is determined. To design the optimal patterns of A, B, C, and D for a specific quantum processor, a search strategy is proposed as shown below:\n\n(1) Set constraints, including the topology of the processor, the circuit depth of RQC, the sequence of four patterns (usually ABCDCDAB), and the maximum permissible number of two-qubit gates in the partition.\n\n(2) Set the structures of patterns of A, B, C, and D.\n\n(3) According to the conditions in (1) and (2), search for the optimal cuts with the least number of effective crosspartition gates, where the number of effective crosspartition gates $L$ is determined using the following formula,\n$$\n\nL=g_{\\text{cut}}-g_{\\text{wedge}}-g_{\\text{DCD}}-\\frac{g_{{\\text{start,end}}}}{2}\n\\label{eq:1}\n\n$$\nwhere $g_{\\text{cut}}$ is the number of crosspartition gates, $g_{\\text{wedge}}$ is the number of wedge formations, $g_{\\text{DCD}}$ is the number of DCD formations, and $g_{{\\text{start,end}}}$ is the number of the formations of iSWAP-like gates at the start and end of the circuit. Step (3) outputs the optimal cut and the number of corresponding effective crosspartition gates, denoted as $\\text{Min}_L$, which determines the computational complexity of SFA for simulating the circuit designed with the set patterns.\n\nRepeat steps (2) and (3) to search for the optimal patterns that have the  maximum $\\text{Min}_L$.

The latter pursuit is very active, with several groups developing\nvertical (rather than the traditional lateral) interconnection of input/output (I/O) signals using through-the-wafer coaxial lines\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], electro-mechanical sockets\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and bump-bonding in flip-chip configuration\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nFor true scalability, it is crucial that the unit cell also extend into the classical control plane. A unit cell for control signals opens the door to hardware simplification through spatial multiplexing, i.e., the selective routing of control signals (with minimal customization) to spatially separated components. While frequency-division multiplexing is already heavily exploited in cQED\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], spatial multiplexing is in its infancy.  Precision control of same-frequency qubits using a microwave-frequency vector switch matrix (VSM) for pulse multicasting has only recently been demonstrated\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn this paper, we propose a scalable scheme for the QEC cycle of a monolithic superconducting surface code by defining a concrete unit cell for both the quantum hardware and the control signals. We focus on a fabric of fast-flux-tunable transmon qubits interacting with nearest neighbors via flux-controlled conditional-phase $(\\CZf)$ gates\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] realized by pulsing into the resonator-mediated $\\ket{11} \\leftrightarrow \\ket{02}$ avoided crossing of the interacting transmon pair (numbers indicate excitation level).

Our eight-qubit unit cell uses three fixed frequencies for all single-qubit control and eight detuning sequences for two-qubit gates. This approach to classical control allows significant control hardware savings via spatial multiplexing. By pipelining the measurement of the two types of stabilizers of the surface code, we engineer detuning patterns avoiding all second-order transmon-transmon interactions except those exploited in $\\CZf$ gates, regardless of fabric size. Our scheme allows changing the weight of stabilizer measurements by simple on/off masking of detuning pulses, making it applicable to both defect-based and planar logical qubits\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], including lattice surgery\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]."}

Following an initial rough calibration of the qubit readout, bias voltage, frequency, and\u00a0$\\pi$-pulse amplitude, the following procedure was used to precisely calibrate the qubit.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSingle-qubit\u00a0$X_\\pi$ calibration procedure. a-c, g-i Measurement pulse sequences for panels d-f, j-l respectively. d Ramsey vs. bias voltage measurement in order to precisely determine the voltage corresponding to\u00a0$\\Phi_\\text{ext} = \\SI{0.5}{\\Phi_0}$ (termed the `sweet spot'). e Calibrating the readout I and Q coordinates for the fluxonium\u00a0$\\ket{0}$ and\u00a0$\\ket{1}$ states.

We played a varying even number of\u00a0$X_\\pi$ pulses with alternating amplitude while also varying the DRAG parameter. When correctly calibrated, each\u00a0$X_\\pi$ pulse cancels out with the subsequent\u00a0$X_{-\\pi}$ pulse. k A separate DRAG calibration but using a larger number of pulses to calibrate the DRAG parameter more accurately. l A pulse train consisting of an odd number of\u00a0$X_\\pi$ pulses was used to precisely calibrate the amplitude of the pulse. m Calibration flowchart for single-qubit gates. Panels are shown for all calibrations starting from the `Precise sweet spot' calibration.\n\n* Precise sweet-spot calibration [fig:sup_1qb_cala,\u00a0d]. With fixed drive frequency (slightly negatively detuned from the qubit frequency) and fixed drive amplitude, Ramsey oscillations were obtained as a function of flux around the sweet spot. The oscillation frequencies were fit to a parabola, and the center of the parabola fit was used as the bias voltage corresponding to\u00a0$\\Phi_\\text{ext} = \\SI{0.5}{\\Phi_0}$, termed the `sweet spot'.\n\n* Single-shot readout calibration [fig:sup_1qb_calb,\u00a0e]. Although optimizing the readout does not impact the gate fidelity, we re-measured the locations of the single-shot blobs corresponding to\u00a0$\\ket{0}$ and\u00a0$\\ket{1}$ here to correct for flux-related changes in the readout signal.\n\n* Precise qubit frequency calibration [fig:sup_1qb_calc,\u00a0f]. To accurately obtain the qubit frequency, we performed qubit spectroscopy with a low enough power such that little power broadening was observed. This typically gave kHz-level precision, a sufficient starting point for DRAG.\n\n* Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) calibration [fig:sup_1qb_calg-h,\u00a0j-k]. While scanning the DRAG parameter, we performed a train of\u00a0$\\pi$-pulses with alternating positive and negative amplitudes. The DRAG parameter which minimized the observed oscillation between the\u00a0$\\ket{0}$ and\u00a0$\\ket{1}$ state was chosen. This measurement may be repeated with a larger number of pulses to increase the resolution of the DRAG parameter. Contrary to other fluxonium experiments\u00a0[Bao, Feng, Deng, Hao, Ding, Dawei, Gao, Ran, Gao, Xun, Huang, Cupjin, Jiang, Xun, Ku, Hsiang-Sheng, Li, Zhisheng, Ma, Xizheng, others, \"Fluxonium: an alternative qubit platform for high-fidelity operations\", 2022] [Somoroff, Aaron, Ficheux, Quentin, Mencia, Raymond A, Xiong, Haonan, Kuzmin, Roman V, Manucharyan, Vladimir E, \"Millisecond coherence in a superconducting qubit\", 2021], we found DRAG calibration necessary to avoid coherent additional errors. We measured the optimal DRAG parameter to vary depending on the room temperature filtering scheme and not with the anharmonicity of the qubit, which leads us to suspect the calibration was correcting for small distortions in the drive line\u00a0[Gustavsson, Simon, Zwier, Olger, Bylander, Jonas, Yan, Fei, Yoshihara, Fumiki, Nakamura, Yasunobu, Orlando, Terry P, Oliver, William D, \"Improving quantum gate fidelities by using a qubit to measure microwave pulse distortions\", 2013].\n\n* Precise drive amplitude calibration [fig:sup_1qb_cali,\u00a0l]. To improve the precision of a single Rabi oscillation, we utilized a pulse train with an odd number of pulses while varying the pulse amplitude. This serves to multiply the oscillation frequency by the number of pulses used, allowing for increased precision on the calibrated\u00a0$\\pi$-pulse amplitude.\n\nAfter calibration, we benchmarked our single-qubit gates using standard single-qubit randomized benchmarking\u00a0[Magesan, Easwar, Gambetta, Jay M, Emerson, Joseph, \"Scalable and robust randomized benchmarking of quantum processes\", 2011] [Barends, Rami, Kelly, Julian, Megrant, Anthony, Veitia, Andrzej, Sank, Daniel, Jeffrey, Evan, White, Ted C, Mutus, Josh, Fowler, Austin G, Campbell, Brooks, others, \"Superconducting quantum circuits at the surface code threshold for fault tolerance\", 2014]. In our randomized benchmarking, we applied a sequence of random Clifford gates (decomposed into microwave gates\u00a0${\\{I,\\, \\pm X,\\, \\pm Y,\\, \\pm X_{\\pi/2},\\, \\pm Y_{\\pi/2}\\}}$) followed by a recovery gate which inverts the previous sequence and then measure the probability the qubit remains in its initial state (we arbitrarily choose\u00a0$\\ket{0}$). As a function of Clifford sequence length, this probability was fit to the exponential decay:\u00a0${p_0(m) = A p^m + B}$. In this model, $A$ and\u00a0$B$ absorb the effects of state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, and\u00a0$p$ is the depolarizing parameter. The average fidelity of each Clifford operation is given by\u00a0$F_\\text{Clifford} = 1 - (1 - 1/d)(1 - p)$, where\u00a0$d=2^\\text{number of qubits}$ is the size of the Hilbert space. Our specific decomposition of Clifford gates into microwave single-qubit gates uses, on average, 1.875 gates per Clifford. From this, we compute the average single-qubit gate fidelity as\n$$\n\nF_\\text{single-qubit} = 1 - (1 - 1/d)(1 - p) / 1.875.\n\n$$\nThe uncertainty on the fidelity is expressed as a standard error of the mean, which was obtained by setting  to be  in  and using standard error propagation techniques. Error bars on individual RB points are likewise standard errors, obtained by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the number of randomizations."}

{"prompt": "Explain the 'Complete calibration of conversion chain' section of the paper.", "completion": "< g r a p h i c s >\n\nFlow chart graphically summarises the calibration loop.\nThe upconversion calibration alternately updates $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ using an estimated value of $\\tilde{C}(n, m)$ obtained from the downconversion stage.\nA Kalman filter is used to calibrate the downconversion stage to ensure a correct value of $\\tilde{C}(n, m)$ is obtained.\n\nThe upconversion and downconversion mixers are individually straightforward to calibrate, as previously shown. However, many experimental setups consists of both upconversion and downconversion stages, each with imbalances that needs to be corrected.\nCalibrating both mixers in situ introduces another problem not addressed so far: how does one go about distinguishing the error of one mixer from another?\nWe introduce and demonstrate two new approaches that resolves this issue and permits automated calibration of the entire frequency conversion chain.\n\nThese ideas are tested on a fairly typical experimental setup for research in circuit QED, shown in Fig. (Figure fig:set_up).\nThe digital source used to generate the I and Q signals is the Vivace platform from Intermodulation Products AB <cit.>.\nThis same instrument also coherently demodulates the downconverted signals.\nWith multiple output and input ports to drive and measure at the I and Q ports of both up- and downconversion mixers, and with its ability to coherently modulate and demodulate up to 32 frequencies simultaneously, Vivace greatly simplifies our measurement setup.\nThe output is upconverted with a IQ0318M mixer from Marki Microwave and split with a power divider into two branches.\nOne branch is connected to a spectrum analyzer.\nThe spectrum analyzer is not required and its sole purpose is to act as an independent observer of the calibration procedure.\nMeanwhile, the other branch is connected to a dilution refrigerator, wired with low-noise amplifiers, attenuators, circulators and isolators.\nThe signal is finally downconverted with another IQ0318M mixer, before being digitally demodulated from intermediate frequency (IF) to baseband with Vivace.\n\nThe ILR produced by the imbalanced upconversion mixer can be measured by both the spectrum analyzer and the imbalanced downconversion stage.\nIf the downconversion calibration works ideally, the ILR measured at the downconversion stage (henceforth referred to as the downconversion ILR) will be identical to the ILR measured with the spectrum analyzer (referred to as the upconversion ILR).\n\nThe calibration loop is graphically summarized in Fig. (Figure fig:flow_chart).\nIt can be divided into two sections, corresponding to the up- and downconversion stages.\nThe loop principally follows the algorithm in section <ref>.\nThe new addition is the Kalman filter (see section <ref>) at the downconversion stage.\nThe Kalman filter is run for several iterations (in our case, the number of iterations ranged from 20-100) to calibrate the downconversion mixer, which is necessary to acquire an accurate value for $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_i,\\hat{\\beta}_j)$ (see Eq. (<ref>)).\nThis in turn suggests the next $\\hat{\\alpha}_i$ or $\\hat{\\beta}_i$ through Eq. (<ref>) and (<ref>).\nHowever, the imbalanced upconversion-mixer will generate correlated signals and images, violating the assumption $\\langle Y_m Y_{-m} \\rangle = 0$ necessary for downconversion-mixer calibration.\n\nWe present two methods to circumvent this problem.\nThe first method involves calibrating with white noise at the signal and image bands.\nWhile calibrating the downconversion mixer, we turn off the upconversion-mixer output, and sample noise instead.\nFor the sake of clarity, we explicitly list the first few steps of the procedure. First initialize by choosing $\\hat{\\alpha}_1$ and $\\hat{\\alpha}_2$ close to 1, $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ close to 0, then:\n\n* Turn off the RF upconversion-mixer output (by turning off the IF signal).\n\n* Run the Kalman filter (according to section <ref>) by sampling incoming noise in the signal and image bands. This results in a best $\\hat{k}_{q}$.\n\n* Turn on the RF upconversion-mixer output. Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$. Measure both signal and image sidebands at the downconversion stage.\n\n* Proceed to reconstruct the undistorted sidebands according to Eq. (<ref>), using the recently acquired $\\hat{k}_{q}$. The ratio of powers is the downconversion ILR. Use it to calculate the quantity $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_1,\\hat{\\beta}_1)$, as defined in Eq. (<ref>).\n\n* Turn off the RF upconversion-mixer output.\n\n* Run the Kalman filter (according to section <ref>) by sampling incoming noise in the signal and image bands. This results in a new best $\\hat{k}_{q}$.\n\n* Turn on the RF upconversion-mixer output. Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_2$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$. Measure both signal and image sidebands at the downconversion stage.\n\n* Proceed to reconstruct the undistorted sidebands according to equation (<ref>), using the recently updated $\\hat{k}_{q}$. The ratio of powers is the downconversion ILR. Use it to calculate the quantity $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_2,\\hat{\\beta}_1)$.\n\n\u22ee\n\nNotice how we follow the algorithm given in section <ref>, with the addition of turning off the upconversion mixer output and calibrating the downconversion mixer before every new estimate of $\\tilde{C}(n, m)$. The initialization of the Kalman filter would be either a best guess or using the best estimate values from the previous Kalman filter loop.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDownconverting with an LO detuned by $\\delta f$, referred to as a carrier frequency offset (CFO), spectrally separates the two sidebands at downconversion by $2\\delta f$. As a consequence, the downconversion stage effectively measures two signal-image pairs. If we call the red and blue arrows signals, then their respective images contain only noise. Each signal-image pair is therefore uncorrelated and the downconversion calibration is valid.\n\nThe second method to separate the calibration of upconversion and downconversion relies on two different carrier tones, detuned by a carrier frequency offset (CFO).\nReferring to Fig. (Figure fig:CFO_schematic), a CFO will prevent the incoming signal (blue) and image (red) sidebands from being superimposed upon downconversion.\nThus from the perspective of the downconversion stage, the blue and red arrows are two incoming signals, with their respective image bands containing only noise.\nThe Kalman filter is run for each pair separately (essentially two filters running in parallel) and generates two values $\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q$ and $\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q$.\nThe red and blue signals are distorted by the imbalances in the downconversion mixer, and are corrected by inserting $\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q$ and $\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q$ into Eq. (<ref>)\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_\\text{red} \\\\\nY^*_{-, \\text{red}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n&=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -\\hat{k}_{q, \\text{red}} \\\\\n-\\hat{k}^*_{q, \\text{red}} & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\text{red} \\\\\nZ^*_{-, \\text{red}}\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\\\\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_\\text{blue} \\\\\nY^*_{-, \\text{blue}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n&=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -\\hat{k}_{q, \\text{blue}} \\\\\n-\\hat{k}^*_{q, \\text{blue}} & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\text{blue} \\\\\nZ^*_{-, \\text{blue}}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\n$$\nThe ILR used to calibrate the upconversion mixer is then calculated as $\\text{ILR} = |Y_\\text{red}|/|Y_\\text{blue}|$.\nUsing a CFO, a proper estimation of the ILR necessitates measuring four frequency bands (two signal-image pairs), instead of the two (one signal-image pair).\nThe Vivace platform is well suited to this task as its multifrequency lock-in can measure up to 32 bands.\nIt is also worth noting that $\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q$ and $\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q$ are frequency dependent and the relative difference is expected to vary as a function of CFO.\nIn our case, we used a CFO of 20kHz resulting in typical magnitude ratios of $|\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q|/|\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q| \\approx 1.007$ and phase ratios of $\\angle\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q/\\angle\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q \\approx 0.988$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nComparing the upconversion and downconversion ILR. Ideally the two quantities should be equal, as indicated by the black dashed line. Major deviations are due to faulty calibration. Small deviations are attributed to frequency dependent attenuation in the cryogenic electronics. Differences between the various methods are explained in the main text.\n\nFig. (Figure fig:up_down_conv) plots the upconversion ILR, as measured by the spectrum analyzer, vs. the downconversion ILR, as measured by Vivace.\nSuccessive iterations of the calibration are plotted as points, connected with dashed lines, starting in the upper right with large ILR, and proceeding toward the lower left with reduced ILR.\nThe colors represent different calibration scenarios.\nThe dashed diagonal line represents the ideal case.\nNotice that attempts to calibrate both up- and downconversion simultaneously while $\\langle Y_m Y_{-m} \\rangle \\neq 0$ (red), fail to produce the ideal result, as expected.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nCalibration with CFO as a function of iteration number.\nCalibration time is limited by the spectrum analyzer used to monitor the upconversion ILR.\nIf we remove this monitor, -70 dB ILR can be reached within a couple of seconds.\nThe imbalance parameters are $\\alpha = 0.923$ and $\\beta = -0.0327$, corresponding to $G_{\\text{up}} = 0.961$ and $\\phi_{\\text{up}} = -2.03^\\circ$.\n\nTwo calibrations using only noise (blue and orange) are depicted, the difference being the amount of time spent sampling noise (2s and 10s respectively).\nThe accuracy is decent for large ILR, but suffers as we approach -40 dB.\n\nThe calibration improves significantly if we use a signal and a CFO (green).\nWe can accurately reconstruct the ILR down to -70 dB.\nNotice the offset of roughly 3 dB from the diagonal, corresponding to an overestimate of the ILR at the downconversion stage.\nWe attribute this to an unequal attenuation of the sidebands in the cryogenic electronics.\n\nFinally, Fig. (Figure fig:CFO_down_conv) depicts calibration with CFO of two imbalanced mixers as a function of time.\nEach point corresponds to a complete loop around the chart in Fig. (Figure fig:flow_chart). The downconversion ILR is successfully suppressed to less than -60 dB with our setup, showing that we can calibrate both up- and downconversion mixers simultaneously. The offset from the upconversion ILR is attributed to frequency-dependent attenuation in the cryogenic electronics."}

They can conveniently find the protocol chapters in the table of contents by looking out for chapter titles that are typeset in italic font.\n\nIn more detail, the mathematical methods and certification protocols presented here are the following:\nwe start our discussion on quantum states with a brief introduction to the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, such as mathematical notions of operators and the modeling of quantum mechanical measurements (Section\u00a0<ref>).\nThis allows us to formally introduce quantum state certification as a one-sided statistical test in Section\u00a0<ref>.\nCertification protocols rely on quantum mechanical measurements, which are probabilistic in nature.\nTherefore, the confidence of the protocols is controlled using so-called tail bounds introduced in Section\u00a0<ref>.\nAs an example for an application of tail bounds, we derive the estimation error and the confidence when estimating expectation values of observables in Section\u00a0<ref>.\nIn order to quantify the accuracy of quantum state preparations, we introduce relevant metrics on quantum states in Section\u00a0<ref>.\nA popular metric is given by the (Uhlmann) fidelity.\nWe provide a certification protocol in terms of the fidelity in Section\u00a0<ref>.\nStabilizer states are an important class of quantum states that can be certified with particularly few Pauli measurements (Section\u00a0<ref>).\nAnother approach to certification employs estimation protocols.\nEstimating the fidelity requires more measurements compared to the one-sided certification protocol.\nA tool to reduce the measurement effort is importance sampling introduced in Section\u00a0<ref>.\nDFE uses this method to estimate the fidelity w.r.t. pure target states from relatively few state copies, Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\nFor the remaining part of the tutorial random quantum states and random unitaries play an important role.\nFor this reason, we introduce them in Section\u00a0<ref>.\nCertain random unitary operations allow, in general, for an estimation of the fidelity from fewer state copies than DFE, which we explain in Section\u00a0<ref> on SFE.\n\nWe start our discussion of quantum processes with some mathematical preliminaries (Section\u00a0<ref>), where we introduce the Choi- isomorphism (a.k.a. channel-state duality), process fidelity measures quantifying average-case error measures and a worst-case error measure, the diamond norm.\nMost certification methods for quantum processes use average-case error measures.\nThe presented quantum state certification methods can be translated to quantum processes using the Choi- isomorphism.\nAs an example, Section\u00a0<ref> presents the resulting protocol for direct quantum process certification.\nSuch translated protocols, typically require high-quality state preparations and measurements to probe the quantum processes.\nA method tailored to quantum gates that allows the average gate fidelity to be extracted without requiring highly accurate state preparations and measurements is RB (Section\u00a0<ref>).\nAs our last protocol we discuss XEB in Section\u00a0<ref>;\nthis method has been used by Google to build trust in their recent experiment demonstrating the potential power of quantum computers in the task of generating certain random samples."}

In this paper, we introduce techniques originally developed for wireless communication applications to calibrate upconversion and downconversion mixers.\nA Kalman filter together with a controllable carrier frequency offset calibrates both mixers without removing them from the embedding measurement infrastructure.\nThese techniques can be embedded into room temperature control electronics and they will find widespread use as circuit QED devices continue to grow in size and complexity.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe superconducting qubit processors are continuously growing in scale and complexity, placing increasing demands on the performance of room temperature electronics.\nAn essential component is the IQ mixer.\nIn circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) <cit.>, IQ mixers are used to upconvert control signals from classical electronics and downconvert signals emitted from the quantum circuit.\nIn wireless radiofrequency (RF) and microwave systems, IQ mixers are particularly useful for Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) schemes, commonly used for cost-efficient and high-data-rate systems <cit.>.\nApplications include point-to-point communication <cit.> and various radar technologies <cit.>.\n\nIQ mixers are analog components, which by their very nature require calibration.\nThe error we calibrate for in this paper is the so-called mixer imbalance.\nFor upconversion, the imbalance manifests as the generation of a spurious signal called the image, accompanying every desired signal.\nFor downconversion imbalance prevents unambiguous separation of the signal and image sidebands in a heterodyne detection scheme (or equivalently, a low-IF receiver setup).\nIn either case, calibration of the IQ mixer allows for conversion to a single sideband of the carrier frequency and suppression of its image, thus leading to more efficient use of frequency space.\nThis efficiency becomes critical, for example, when implementing high-fidelity qubit gates [A. Bengtsson, \"Quantum information processing with tunable and low-loss superconducting circuits\", 2020] for quantum computing and applications where multiple qubits are controlled and measured on the same signal line.\nSuch frequency-domain multiplexing of signals is also highly desirable in modern communication technology [M. Windisch, \"Estimation and Compensation of I/Q Imbalance\nin Broadband Communications Receivers\", 2007].\n\nTechnological progress in direct synthesis and sampling of RF signals is rapidly progressing <cit.>, but until this technology covers the entire frequency band used in circuit QED, IQ mixers are an unfortunate necessity.\nHowever we can use various digital techniques to compensate for their imperfections.\nThis is occasionally referred to as the dirty RF paradigm, where imperfect, or dirty, RF devices are improved through digital means <cit.>.\nIn this paper, we combine ideas originally developed for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) applications to calibrate mixers in a circuit-QED setting.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nThe image leakage ratio (ILR) of an upconversion mixer as it changes over time, due to drifts in the mixer parameters. Similar phenomena will also occur at the downconversion stage. In either case, regular re-calibration is necessary for optimal performance.\n\nThe ideal calibration method should avoid any additional external equipment such as RF sources and spectrum analyzers, and it should calibrate both mixers simultaneously.\nIn addition it should also permit frequent re-calibration of the mixers to compensate for drift, which can be substantial. For example, in Fig. (Figure fig: drift_example) we plot the image leakage ratio (ILR), defined as the ratio of power at the image band to the power at the signal band, vs. time.\nInitially the image is suppressed, but gradually increases over time by 20dB.\nWe attribute this drift to changes in the mixer's temperature.\nThis strongly suggests that regular re-calibration of mixers is necessary in order to maintain optimal performance of superconducting qubit processors.\nFor frequent re-calibration to be feasible, the both mixers must be calibrated in situ.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel technique that achieves these goals.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: in section II we introduce the simplified IQ mixer model for upconversion and downconversion and a model for mixer imbalance. In section III we discuss the digital algorithms for calibration. In section IV we apply these techniques to a typical experimental circuit-QED setup with low-intermediate frequency (IF) transmission and receiver stage. In addition, we introduce our method to calibrate both upconversion and downconversion mixers simultaneously. In the final section V, we conclude with a brief summary.\n\n## Modelling the IQ Mixer\nAn ideal IQ mixer should behave as a multiplier of signals in the time domain.\nOne of the signals is often a pure tone at high frequency, called a carrier wave, and the mixer is used to convert or translate the frequency components of the other tone, either up or down in frequency.\nStarting with upconversion, mixing in the time domain can be described as [J. Kim, H. Jo, K. Lee, D. Lee, D. Choi, S. Kim, \"A Low-Complexity I/Q Imbalance Calibration Method for Quadrature Modulator\", 2019] [M. Windisch, G. Fettweis, \"Adaptive I/Q imbalance compensation in low-IF transmitter architectures\", 2004]\n\n$$\n\nr(t) = \\Re\\{z(t)e^{j \\Omega t}\\},\n\\label{ideal_upconversion_mixer_model}\n\n$$\nwhere $r(t)$ is the signal at the RF output port, $\\Omega$ is the frequency of the carrier applied to the local-oscillator (LO) input port and $z(t) = z_I(t) + j z_Q(t)$ denotes the signals applied to the I and Q input ports (see Fig. (Figure fig: upconversion circuit) (a) ).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\na) A schematic upconversion circuit with phase $\\phi$ and amplitude $G$ imbalances indicated in red font.\nb) A schematic downconversion circuit with imbalances indicated in red font.\n\nIn the frequency domain this description is well illustrated in matrix form\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc[\\omega] \\\\\nc^*[-\\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nz[\\Omega + \\omega] \\\\\nz^*[\\Omega - \\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\label{ideal_upconversion_FT}\n\n$$\nwhere $r[\\omega] = c[\\omega] + c^*[-\\omega]$.\nUpconversion mixing will therefore create two sidebands at $\\Omega \\pm \\omega$.\nIn this paper, we refer to the upper sideband $\\Omega + \\omega$ as the signal and the lower sideband $\\Omega - \\omega$ as the image.\n\nThe image is generally undesirable as it crowds the limited bandwidth, otherwise needed for multiplexing, with unwanted signals.\nThis frequency crowding is particularly detrimental to applications in wireless local-area networks (WLAN) <cit.>, as well to the fidelity of frequency-multiplexed control and readout of superconducting qubits<cit.>.\nThe image can be cancelled by injecting the appropriate signals into the I and Q ports of the IQ mixer, such that $z_I(t) + j z_Q(t) = x(t)e^{j\\omega t}$, where $x(t)$ is real.\n\nHowever, this cancellation is negatively affected by imperfections in the mixer.\nWe will characterize these imperfections as amplitude $G_{\\text{up}}$ and phase $\\phi_{\\text{up}}$ imbalance, stemming from an asymmetry in the I and Q branches of the mixer.\nThe imbalance modifies Eq. (<ref>) according to\n$$\n\nr(t) = \\Re\\{z(t)\\left[\\cos \\left(\\Omega t \\right) + j G_{\\text{up}} \\sin \\left(\\Omega t + \\phi_{\\text{up}}\\right)\\right]\\},\n\\label{nonideal_upconversion_mixer_model}\n\n$$\nthus Eq. (<ref>) becomes\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nc[\\omega] \\\\\nc^*[-\\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\\frac{1}{4}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n{J^*_{\\text{up}}} & {K_{\\text{up}}} \\\\\n{K^*_{\\text{up}}} & {J_{\\text{up}}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nz[\\Omega + \\omega] \\\\\nz^*[\\Omega - \\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\label{nonideal_upconversion_FT}\n\n$$\nwhere we define the complex quantities $J_{\\text{up}} = 1 + G_{\\text{up}} e^{-j\\phi_{\\text{up}}}$ and $K_{\\text{up}} = 1 - G_{\\text{up}} e^{j\\phi_{\\text{up}}}$.\nWe regain the perfect mixer relations by setting $G_{\\text{up}} = 1$ and $\\phi_{\\text{up}} = 0$.\nDue to the presence of the off-diagonal terms, injecting $z(t) = x(t)e^{j\\omega t}$ will no longer cancel the image completely.\nHowever, if the phase and amplitude imbalances were known (or equivalently, $J_{\\text{up}}$ and $K_{\\text{up}}$), an appropriate $z(t)$ could be generated to cancel the image.\n\nThe ideal behavior of a downconversion mixer is very similar to upconversion. In the time domain the output at the I and Q ports are given by <cit.>\n$$\n\nz(t)= z_I(t) + j z_Q(t) = \\text{LPF}\\{r(t)e^{-j \\Omega t}\\},\n\\label{ideal_downconversion_mixer_model}\n\n$$\nwhere LPF denotes a low-pass filter(see Fig. (Figure fig: upconversion circuit) (b)).\nThe output at the I and Q ports contain both signal and image, which we write as $z(t) = Z_\\text{sig}(t) + Z_\\text{img}(t)$.\nIn the frequency domain we have\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\text{sig}[\\omega] \\\\\nZ_\\text{img}^*[-\\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\\frac{1}{2}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_\\text{sig}[\\omega + \\Omega] \\\\\nY_\\text{img}^*[-\\omega + \\Omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\label{ideal_downconversion_FT}\n\n$$\nwhere $Y_\\text{sig}[\\omega + \\Omega]$ and $Y_\\text{img}[\\omega + \\Omega]$ is the signal and image respectively entering the RF input port.\n\nAmplitude and phase imbalance are introduced in an analogous manner. The time domain expression is modified according to\n$$\n\nz(t) = \\text{LPF}\\{r(t)\\left[\\cos \\left(\\Omega t \\right) - j G_{\\text{down}} \\sin \\left(\\Omega t + \\phi_{\\text{down}}\\right)\\right]\\},\n\\label{nonideal_downconversion_mixer_model}\n\n$$\nand the analogous frequency-domain expression is <cit.>\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\text{sig}[\\omega] \\\\\nZ_\\text{img}^*[-\\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\\frac{1}{4}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nJ_{\\text{down}} & K_{\\text{down}} \\\\\n{K^*_{\\text{down}}} & {J^*_{\\text{down}}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_\\text{sig}[\\omega + \\Omega] \\\\\nY_\\text{img}^*[-\\omega + \\Omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\label{nonideal_downconversion_FT}\n\n$$\nThe definitions for $J_{\\text{down}}$ and $K_{\\text{down}}$ are analogous to the upconversion case.\nSince the matrix is no longer diagonal, imbalance will cause downconversion from both signal and image sidebands of the carrier.\n\nFurther simplification is made by decomposing the matrix in Eq. (<ref>) into <cit.>\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\text{sig}[\\omega] \\\\\nZ_\\text{img}^*[-\\omega]\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\frac{1}{2}\n\\underbrace{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & k_q \\\\\nk_q^* & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}_\\text{leakage matrix}\n\\underbrace{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nJ_{\\text{down}} & 0 \\\\\n0 & J^*_{\\text{down}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}_\\text{scaling matrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_\\text{sig}[\\omega + \\Omega] \\\\\nY_\\text{img}^*[-\\omega + \\Omega]\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\label{nonideal_downconversion_double_matrix}\n\n$$\nwhere $k_q$ is the ratio\n$$\n\nk_q =  \\frac{K_{\\text{down}}}{J^*_{\\text{down}}} = \\frac{1-G_{\\text{down}}e^{j\\phi_{\\text{down}}}}{1+G_{\\text{down}} e^{j \\phi_{\\text{down}}}}.\n\n$$\n\n## Correcting the IQ Mixer\nIn this section we take a look at how to calibrate the IQ mixers at both the upconversion and downconversion stage. We start by discussing the  upconversion mixer calibration in subsection <ref> and then proceed to discuss the downconversion calibration in subsection <ref>.\n\n### Upconversion stage\nFor upconversion, the signals $z_I$ and $z_Q$ are typically generated with a digital source, allowing for fine tuning of their amplitude and phase so as to cancel the image. We refer to this process as digital pre-distortion. The quality of the cancellation is measured by the image leakage ratio (ILR) defined as,\n$$\n\n\\text{ILR} = \\frac{\\text{power at image frequency}}{\\text{power at signal frequency}}.\n\\label{eqn: ILR def}\n\n$$\n\nTo correct for this drift one can introduce feedback to adjust the amplitude and phase of the digital pre-distortion signals at the I and Q ports, so as to continuously minimize the ILR.\nThe upconversion circuit schematic in Fig. (Figure fig: upconversion circuit) (a) is extended to include the digital source, depicted in Fig. (Figure fig: upconversion_model).\nThe amplitude and phase imbalances of the upconversion mixer are replaced by the alternative imbalance parameters $\\alpha = G_{\\text{up}} \\cos \\phi_{\\text{up}}$ and $\\beta = G_{\\text{up}} \\sin \\phi_{\\text{up}}$.\nIn the digital pre-distortion stage these parameters are denoted as $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$.\nThe ILR can then be expressed as <cit.>\n$$\n\n\\text{ILR}(\\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\beta}) = \\frac{(\\alpha - \\hat{\\alpha})^2 + (\\beta - \\hat{\\beta})^2}{(\\alpha + \\hat{\\alpha})^2+ (\\beta - \\hat{\\beta})^2}, \\label{eqn: ILR}\n\n$$\nrevealing that when $\\hat{\\alpha} = \\alpha$ and $\\hat{\\beta} = \\beta$ we have optimal image suppression.\nIn the absence of any digital pre-distortion, i.e. $\\hat{\\alpha} = 1$ and $\\hat{\\beta} = 0$, the ILR then depends on the intrinsic imbalances of the mixer, which vanishes for the perfectly balanced mixer $\\alpha = 1$ and $\\beta = 0$.\n\nWe can use semi-analytical methods <cit.> or use various minimization techniques such as the Nelder-Mead method <cit.> to identify parameters $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$.\nIn this work we apply an iterative algorithm from Ref. <cit.>.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic for the upconversion circuit. The amplitude and phase imbalances $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are compensated by digitally distorting the IF input as indicated in the figure. See Ref. <cit.> for details.\n\nThe cost function to minimize is the quantity:\n$$\n\n\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_i,\\hat{\\beta}_j) = 4 \\hat{\\alpha}_i^2 \\text{ILR}_{i, j} \\label{eqn: C}\n\n$$\nwhere the subscripts $i$ and $j$ track the iteration steps and $\\text{ILR}_{i,j}$ is the measured image leakage ratio with the applied pre-distortion parameters $\\hat{\\alpha}_i$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_j$.\n\nThe updated distortion parameter $\\hat{\\alpha}_i$ is calculated according to\n$$\n\n\\hat{\\alpha}_i &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\hat{\\alpha}_{i - 2} + \\hat{\\alpha}_{i - 1} - \\frac{ \\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_{i-2},\\hat{\\beta}_{i-2}) - \\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_{i-1},\\hat{\\beta}_{i-2}) }{\\hat{\\alpha}_{i - 2} - \\hat{\\alpha}_{i - 1}} \\right), \\label{eqn: update_alpha_rule}\n\n$$\nwhile the updated $\\hat{\\beta}_i$ is calculated according to\n$$\n\n\\hat{\\beta}_i &= \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\hat{\\beta}_{i - 2} + \\hat{\\beta}_{i - 1} - \\frac{ \\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_{i-1},\\hat{\\beta}_{i-2}) - \\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_{i-1},\\hat{\\beta}_{i-2}) }{\\hat{\\beta}_{i - 2} - \\hat{\\beta}_{i - 1}} \\right). \\label{eqn: update_beta_rule}\n\n$$\n\nWe initialize the algorithm by choosing $\\hat{\\alpha}_0, \\hat{\\alpha}_1 \\approx 1$, $\\hat{\\beta}_0 , \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\approx 0$, and proceed as follows:\n\n* Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_0$, measure $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_0,\\hat{\\beta}_0)$.\n\n* Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_0$, measure $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_1,\\hat{\\beta}_0)$.\n\n* Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, measure $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_1,\\hat{\\beta}_1)$. Compute $\\hat{\\alpha}_2$.\n\n* Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_2$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, measure $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_2,\\hat{\\beta}_1)$. Compute $\\hat{\\beta}_2$.\n\n* Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_2$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_2$, measure $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_2,\\hat{\\beta}_2)$. Compute $\\hat{\\alpha}_3$.\n\n* Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_3$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_2$, measure $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_3,\\hat{\\beta}_2)$. Compute $\\hat{\\beta}_3$.\n\n\u22ee\n\nThe iteration is continued until a desired threshold on the $\\text{ILR}_{i, j}$ is satisfied.\n\n### Downconversion stage\nGiven an observed signal $Z_\\text{sig}[\\omega]$ and idler $Z^*_\\text{img}[-\\omega]$ after downconversion, we want to reconstruct the actual signal $Y_\\text{sig}[\\omega + \\Omega]$ and idler $Y^*_\\text{img}[-\\omega + \\Omega]$ before entering the imbalanced IQ mixer.\nThis is possible according to Eq. (<ref>), if we manage to determine $k_q$ and $J_{\\text{down}}$.\nFor simplicity, the scaling matrix is henceforth neglected since it does not contribute to the leakage between sidebands.\nThis leaves us with only one complex parameter $k_q$.\n\nBefore proceeding, we simplify our notation by introducing $Y_m = Y_\\text{sig}[\\omega + \\Omega]$ and $Y^*_{-m} = Y^*_\\text{img}[-\\omega + \\Omega]$.\nThe subscript $-m$ denotes the images while $m$ denotes signals.\nAnalogous notation will also be used for $Z_\\text{sig}[\\omega]$ and $Z^*_\\text{img}[-\\omega]$.\nThe current best estimate of $k_q$ is denoted $\\hat{k}_q$.\nWith $\\hat{k}_q$ we reconstruct the undistorted signal and image according to\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_m \\\\\nY^*_{-m}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -\\hat{k}_q \\\\\n-\\hat{k}^*_q & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_m \\\\\nZ^*_{-m}\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\label{mixing_model}\n\n$$\nneglecting the complex scaling factor.\n\nWe use a method developed by Windisch and Fettweis <cit.> to estimate $\\hat{k}_q$. If we assume $\\langle Y_m Y_{-m} \\rangle = 0$, it is possible to estimate the mixer imbalance by first calculating:\n$$\n\n\\hat{k}_p &=  \\frac{\\left\\langle{Z_m Z_{-m}}\\right\\rangle}{\\left\\langle\\left|Z_m + Z_{-m}^* \\right|^2 \\right\\rangle}, \\label{downconversion_calibration_eq1}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\langle ... \\rangle$ indicates an average.\nThen $\\hat{k}_q$ is related to $\\hat{k}_p$ according to:\n$$\n\n\\hat{k}_q &= \\frac{1 - a - j b}{1+a+j b},\\\\\nb &= -2 \\Im \\left[ \\hat{k}_p \\right], \\\\\na &= \\sqrt{1-b^2-4 \\Re\\left\\{ \\hat{k}_p \\right\\}},\n\\label{downconversion_calibration_eq5}\n\n$$\nConsequentially, the amplitude and phase imbalances are $G_{\\text{down}} = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and $\\phi_{\\text{down}} = \\arctan(b/a)$ respectively.\nEquations (<ref>) - (<ref>) are the core of the downconversion calibration procedure.\nBecause the downconversion mixer also drifts in time (see Fig. (Figure fig: drift_example)), feedback is also needed to update $\\hat{k}_q$.  The procedure is therefore enhanced with a Kalman filter.\n\nKalman filters are used to determine state variables/parameters (stationary or dynamical) from noisy observations. The filter is employed in such diverse applications as navigation <cit.> and multifrequency atomic force-microscopy <cit.>.\nOther applications include cooling of nanoparticles through feedback <cit.>, and state estimation in atomic magnetometry <cit.> and optomechanics <cit.>.\nFor a detailed theoretical discussion, we refer the interested reader to Ref. <cit.>.\nTo set up a discrete-time Kalman filter, we need a process equation and a measurement equation <cit.>.\n\nThe process equation relates the sought after state variables at two different points in time.\nIn this case, the state variable is $k_q$ and our process equation is\n$$\n\nk_q(i+1) &= k_q(i) + v_p(i). \\label{process_noise}\n\n$$\nThe argument $i$ denotes ordered, finite intervals of time that we henceforth refer to as time frames.\nThe IQ mixer state variable $k_q(i)$ is assumed to evolve in time according to equation (<ref>),  in which the process noise $v_p(i)$ is Gaussian with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2_p (i)$.\nWe attribute the origin of this noise term to various fluctuations in the analog electronics and temperature.\n\nThe measurement equation describes how our estimated value of the state variable, which is determined from noisy measurement data, is related to the actual or true value of the state variable\n$$\n\n\\hat{k}_q(i) &= k_q(i) + v_m(i). \\label{measaurement_noise}\n\n$$\nThe measurement noise $v_m(i)$ is Gaussian with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2_m (i)$.\n\nThe Kalman filter provides the estimated $\\hat{k}_q$ at different time frames.\nThe filtered estimate $\\hat{k}_q(i|\\mathfrak{H}_{i})$, with variance $\\sigma_m^2(i)$, is the best estimate (in the least-square sense) of the state $k_q$ at the current time frame $i$, based on a history of observations $\\mathfrak{H}_{i}$ up to and including frame $i$.\nThe predicted estimate $\\hat{k}_q(i+1|\\mathfrak{H}_{i})$, with variance $\\sigma^2_m(i+1, i)$, is the best estimate for the future frame $i+1$ based on the past history of observations.\n\nThe Kalman filter is initialized at $i=0$ such that $\\hat{k}_q(1|\\mathfrak{H}_{0}) = 0$ and its variance $\\sigma^2_m(1,0) = \\infty$.\nOther values of $\\hat{k}_q(1|\\mathfrak{H}_{0})$ with smaller $\\sigma^2_m(1,0)$ are possible (for example, if we have values from a previous calibration run).\nFor $i \\geqslant 1$ we do the following <cit.>:\n\n* Record $n=1,2, ..., N$ samples of $Z^n_k(i)$, $Z^n_{-k}(i)$ and reconstruct $Y^n_k(i)$, $Y^n_{-k}(i)$ using the predicted $\\hat{k}_q(i|\\mathfrak{H}_{i-1})$ according to Eq. (<ref>). Thereafter, estimate the variances, $\\sigma^2_k(i)$ and $\\sigma^2_{-k}(i)$ from the $Y^n_k(i)$ and $Y^n_{-k}(i)$ data.\n\n* Simultaneously, use $Z^n_k(i)$, $Z^n_{-k}(i)$ to compute $\\hat{k}_q(i)$ according to Eq. (<ref>). Here $\\hat{k}_q(i)$ is the current time frame's noisy estimate. The error variance of this quantity is approximately\n$$\n\n\\sigma_{q}^2(i) &\\approx \\left[N \\left(1 + \\frac{\\sigma^2_{k}}{\\sigma^2_{-k}} \\right) \\left(1 + \\frac{\\sigma^2_{-k}}{\\sigma^2_{k}} \\right) \\right]^{-1}.\n\n$$\n\n* Update the variance of the filtered estimate as\n$$\n\n\\frac{1}{\\sigma_m^2(i)} &= \\frac{1}{\\sigma_m ^2(i, i-1)}+ \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{q}^2(i)}.\n\n$$\n\n* Update the predicted estimate\n$$\n\n\\hat{k}_q(i+1|\\mathfrak{H}_{i}) &= \\sigma_m^2(i) \\left( \\frac{\\hat{k}_q(i|\\mathfrak{H}_{i-1})}{\\sigma_m ^2(i, i-1)} + \\frac{\\hat{k}_q(i)}{\\sigma_{q}^2(i)} \\right).\n\n$$\n\n* Compute the variance of the predicted estimate as\n$$\n\n\\sigma_m^2(i+1, i) &= \\sigma_m^2(i) + \\sigma_p^2(i).\n\n$$\n\n* Finally, update the filtered estimate\n$$\n\n\\hat{k}_q(i|\\mathfrak{H}_{i}) &= \\hat{k}_q(i+1|\\mathfrak{H}_{i}).\n\n$$\n\nNotice that the drift $\\sigma_p^2(i)$ is not updated.\nThis needs to be specified from the start and its magnitude (compared to $\\sigma_m^2(i)$) will determine how little weight is given to past in contrast to present observations.\n\nWe test the filter on a system consisting only of a downconversion mixer driven by a pure RF tone corresponding to the signal.\nThe Kalman filter is initialized with the erroneous assumption that the mixer is ideal with near-zero variance.\nThe incoming RF signal is integrated for 4 ms and the Kalman filter algorithm is used to acquire an estimate of the filtered parameter $\\hat{k}_q(i|\\mathfrak{H}_i)$.\nThe image and signal sidebands are reconstructed according to Eq. (<ref>), whose quality can be assessed by plotting the ILR at each iteration step, see Fig. (Figure fig: pure USB tone calibration).\nThere is a steady decrease in the ILR until the noise floor is reached, indicating a successful calibration of the downconversion mixer.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nReconstructed ILR through the downconversion mixer using a Kalman filter as a function of time frames.\nWe initialize the algorithm by assuming a perfect mixer $G_{\\text{down}} = 1$ and $\\phi_{\\text{down}} = 0$, with near-zero variance.\nAfter 100 iterations, the ILR becomes limited by the noise floor and we extract the filtered parameters $G_{\\text{down}} = 0.961$ and $\\phi_{\\text{down}} = 0.96^\\circ$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic setup for mixer calibration. The output RF signal is split with a Wilkinson power divider. One branch leads to a fully equipped cryogenic low-noise microwave reflection setup inside a dilution refrigerator.\nThe other branch is monitored by a spectrum analyzer, to prove our procedure is working as intended.\n\n## Complete calibration of conversion chain\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nFlow chart graphically summarises the calibration loop.\nThe upconversion calibration alternately updates $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ using an estimated value of $\\tilde{C}(n, m)$ obtained from the downconversion stage.\nA Kalman filter is used to calibrate the downconversion stage to ensure a correct value of $\\tilde{C}(n, m)$ is obtained.\n\nThe upconversion and downconversion mixers are individually straightforward to calibrate, as previously shown. However, many experimental setups consists of both upconversion and downconversion stages, each with imbalances that needs to be corrected.\nCalibrating both mixers in situ introduces another problem not addressed so far: how does one go about distinguishing the error of one mixer from another?\nWe introduce and demonstrate two new approaches that resolves this issue and permits automated calibration of the entire frequency conversion chain.\n\nThese ideas are tested on a fairly typical experimental setup for research in circuit QED, shown in Fig. (Figure fig:set_up).\nThe digital source used to generate the I and Q signals is the Vivace platform from Intermodulation Products AB <cit.>.\nThis same instrument also coherently demodulates the downconverted signals.\nWith multiple output and input ports to drive and measure at the I and Q ports of both up- and downconversion mixers, and with its ability to coherently modulate and demodulate up to 32 frequencies simultaneously, Vivace greatly simplifies our measurement setup.\nThe output is upconverted with a IQ0318M mixer from Marki Microwave and split with a power divider into two branches.\nOne branch is connected to a spectrum analyzer.\nThe spectrum analyzer is not required and its sole purpose is to act as an independent observer of the calibration procedure.\nMeanwhile, the other branch is connected to a dilution refrigerator, wired with low-noise amplifiers, attenuators, circulators and isolators.\nThe signal is finally downconverted with another IQ0318M mixer, before being digitally demodulated from intermediate frequency (IF) to baseband with Vivace.\n\nThe ILR produced by the imbalanced upconversion mixer can be measured by both the spectrum analyzer and the imbalanced downconversion stage.\nIf the downconversion calibration works ideally, the ILR measured at the downconversion stage (henceforth referred to as the downconversion ILR) will be identical to the ILR measured with the spectrum analyzer (referred to as the upconversion ILR).\n\nThe calibration loop is graphically summarized in Fig. (Figure fig:flow_chart).\nIt can be divided into two sections, corresponding to the up- and downconversion stages.\nThe loop principally follows the algorithm in section <ref>.\nThe new addition is the Kalman filter (see section <ref>) at the downconversion stage.\nThe Kalman filter is run for several iterations (in our case, the number of iterations ranged from 20-100) to calibrate the downconversion mixer, which is necessary to acquire an accurate value for $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_i,\\hat{\\beta}_j)$ (see Eq. (<ref>)).\nThis in turn suggests the next $\\hat{\\alpha}_i$ or $\\hat{\\beta}_i$ through Eq. (<ref>) and (<ref>).\nHowever, the imbalanced upconversion-mixer will generate correlated signals and images, violating the assumption $\\langle Y_m Y_{-m} \\rangle = 0$ necessary for downconversion-mixer calibration.\n\nWe present two methods to circumvent this problem.\nThe first method involves calibrating with white noise at the signal and image bands.\nWhile calibrating the downconversion mixer, we turn off the upconversion-mixer output, and sample noise instead.\nFor the sake of clarity, we explicitly list the first few steps of the procedure. First initialize by choosing $\\hat{\\alpha}_1$ and $\\hat{\\alpha}_2$ close to 1, $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ close to 0, then:\n\n* Turn off the RF upconversion-mixer output (by turning off the IF signal).\n\n* Run the Kalman filter (according to section <ref>) by sampling incoming noise in the signal and image bands. This results in a best $\\hat{k}_{q}$.\n\n* Turn on the RF upconversion-mixer output. Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$. Measure both signal and image sidebands at the downconversion stage.\n\n* Proceed to reconstruct the undistorted sidebands according to Eq. (<ref>), using the recently acquired $\\hat{k}_{q}$. The ratio of powers is the downconversion ILR. Use it to calculate the quantity $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_1,\\hat{\\beta}_1)$, as defined in Eq. (<ref>).\n\n* Turn off the RF upconversion-mixer output.\n\n* Run the Kalman filter (according to section <ref>) by sampling incoming noise in the signal and image bands. This results in a new best $\\hat{k}_{q}$.\n\n* Turn on the RF upconversion-mixer output. Distort signals by $\\hat{\\alpha}_2$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$. Measure both signal and image sidebands at the downconversion stage.\n\n* Proceed to reconstruct the undistorted sidebands according to equation (<ref>), using the recently updated $\\hat{k}_{q}$. The ratio of powers is the downconversion ILR. Use it to calculate the quantity $\\tilde{C}(\\hat{\\alpha}_2,\\hat{\\beta}_1)$.\n\n\u22ee\n\nNotice how we follow the algorithm given in section <ref>, with the addition of turning off the upconversion mixer output and calibrating the downconversion mixer before every new estimate of $\\tilde{C}(n, m)$. The initialization of the Kalman filter would be either a best guess or using the best estimate values from the previous Kalman filter loop.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDownconverting with an LO detuned by $\\delta f$, referred to as a carrier frequency offset (CFO), spectrally separates the two sidebands at downconversion by $2\\delta f$. As a consequence, the downconversion stage effectively measures two signal-image pairs. If we call the red and blue arrows signals, then their respective images contain only noise. Each signal-image pair is therefore uncorrelated and the downconversion calibration is valid.\n\nThe second method to separate the calibration of upconversion and downconversion relies on two different carrier tones, detuned by a carrier frequency offset (CFO).\nReferring to Fig. (Figure fig:CFO_schematic), a CFO will prevent the incoming signal (blue) and image (red) sidebands from being superimposed upon downconversion.\nThus from the perspective of the downconversion stage, the blue and red arrows are two incoming signals, with their respective image bands containing only noise.\nThe Kalman filter is run for each pair separately (essentially two filters running in parallel) and generates two values $\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q$ and $\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q$.\nThe red and blue signals are distorted by the imbalances in the downconversion mixer, and are corrected by inserting $\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q$ and $\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q$ into Eq. (<ref>)\n$$\n\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_\\text{red} \\\\\nY^*_{-, \\text{red}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n&=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -\\hat{k}_{q, \\text{red}} \\\\\n-\\hat{k}^*_{q, \\text{red}} & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\text{red} \\\\\nZ^*_{-, \\text{red}}\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\\\\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nY_\\text{blue} \\\\\nY^*_{-, \\text{blue}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n&=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & -\\hat{k}_{q, \\text{blue}} \\\\\n-\\hat{k}^*_{q, \\text{blue}} & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nZ_\\text{blue} \\\\\nZ^*_{-, \\text{blue}}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\n$$\nThe ILR used to calibrate the upconversion mixer is then calculated as $\\text{ILR} = |Y_\\text{red}|/|Y_\\text{blue}|$.\nUsing a CFO, a proper estimation of the ILR necessitates measuring four frequency bands (two signal-image pairs), instead of the two (one signal-image pair).\nThe Vivace platform is well suited to this task as its multifrequency lock-in can measure up to 32 bands.\nIt is also worth noting that $\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q$ and $\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q$ are frequency dependent and the relative difference is expected to vary as a function of CFO.\nIn our case, we used a CFO of 20kHz resulting in typical magnitude ratios of $|\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q|/|\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q| \\approx 1.007$ and phase ratios of $\\angle\\hat{k}^\\text{red}_q/\\angle\\hat{k}^\\text{blue}_q \\approx 0.988$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nComparing the upconversion and downconversion ILR. Ideally the two quantities should be equal, as indicated by the black dashed line. Major deviations are due to faulty calibration. Small deviations are attributed to frequency dependent attenuation in the cryogenic electronics. Differences between the various methods are explained in the main text.\n\nFig. (Figure fig:up_down_conv) plots the upconversion ILR, as measured by the spectrum analyzer, vs. the downconversion ILR, as measured by Vivace.\nSuccessive iterations of the calibration are plotted as points, connected with dashed lines, starting in the upper right with large ILR, and proceeding toward the lower left with reduced ILR.\nThe colors represent different calibration scenarios.\nThe dashed diagonal line represents the ideal case.\nNotice that attempts to calibrate both up- and downconversion simultaneously while $\\langle Y_m Y_{-m} \\rangle \\neq 0$ (red), fail to produce the ideal result, as expected.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nCalibration with CFO as a function of iteration number.\nCalibration time is limited by the spectrum analyzer used to monitor the upconversion ILR.\nIf we remove this monitor, -70 dB ILR can be reached within a couple of seconds.\nThe imbalance parameters are $\\alpha = 0.923$ and $\\beta = -0.0327$, corresponding to $G_{\\text{up}} = 0.961$ and $\\phi_{\\text{up}} = -2.03^\\circ$.\n\nTwo calibrations using only noise (blue and orange) are depicted, the difference being the amount of time spent sampling noise (2s and 10s respectively).\nThe accuracy is decent for large ILR, but suffers as we approach -40 dB.\n\nThe calibration improves significantly if we use a signal and a CFO (green).\nWe can accurately reconstruct the ILR down to -70 dB.\nNotice the offset of roughly 3 dB from the diagonal, corresponding to an overestimate of the ILR at the downconversion stage.\nWe attribute this to an unequal attenuation of the sidebands in the cryogenic electronics.\n\nFinally, Fig. (Figure fig:CFO_down_conv) depicts calibration with CFO of two imbalanced mixers as a function of time.\nEach point corresponds to a complete loop around the chart in Fig. (Figure fig:flow_chart). The downconversion ILR is successfully suppressed to less than -60 dB with our setup, showing that we can calibrate both up- and downconversion mixers simultaneously. The offset from the upconversion ILR is attributed to frequency-dependent attenuation in the cryogenic electronics.\n\n## Conclusion\nCurrent IQ-mixer components for circuit QED experiments are analog devices that, due to their analog nature, come with imperfections and imbalances.\nThese imbalances can be mitigated by digital pre-distortion techniques.\nIn this paper, we have presented several such techniques to calibrate IQ mixers, both for up- and downconversion.\nThese techniques, originally developed for OFDM applications, are shown to be suitable for circuit-QED applications.\nBy careful combination of up- and downconversion techniques, it is possible to calibrate both stages simultaneously.\nIn addition, we show that it is possible to calibrate the mixers in situ, provided the frequency-dependent attenuation is not too large.\nWe believe this will pave the way for more efficient mixer-calibration procedures as superconducting-qubit processors continue to increase in size and complexity in the near future.\n\nWe acknowledge the financial support from the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation through the Wallenberg Center for Quantum Technology (WACQT).\nWe also acknowledge Per Delsing and Simone Gasparinetti for helpful comments.\n\n*\naipnum4-1\n\n"}

and Computer Engineering\n\nPrinceton University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nPrinceton University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n\nAdvances in quantum engineering have enabled the design, measurement, and precise control of synthetic condensed matter systems [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThe platform of superconducting circuits offers two particular capabilities [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]: flexible connectivity of circuit elements that enables a variety of lattice geometries, and circuit nonlinearity that provides access to strongly interacting physics.\nSeparately, these features have allowed for the creation of curved-space lattices [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and the realization of strongly correlated phases [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and dynamics [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] in one-dimensional chains and square lattices.\nMissing in this suite of simulations is the simultaneous integration of interacting particles into lattices with unique band dispersions, such as dispersionless flat bands.\nAn ideal building block for flat-band physics is the Aharonov-Bohm cage [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]: a single plaquette of a lattice whose band structure consists entirely of flat bands.\nHere, we experimentally construct an Aharonov-Bohm cage and observe the localization of a single photon, the hallmark of all-bands-flat physics.\nUpon placing an interaction-bound photon pair into the cage, we see a delocalized walk indicating an escape from Aharonov-Bohm caging [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nWe further find that a variation of caging persists for two particles initialized on opposite sites of the cage.\nThese results mark the first experimental observation of a quantum walk that becomes delocalized due to interactions and establish superconducting circuits for studies of flat-band-lattice dynamics with strong interactions.\n\nFlat electronic bands quench the kinetic energy of electrons and provide a lattice environment that is uniquely susceptible to interactions, disorder, and particle statistics.\nAs a result, they can host a wide range of phenomena, from itinerant ferromagnetism in spinful systems [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] to the fractional quantum Hall effect [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], fractional Chern insulator states [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and strongly correlated phases observed in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThe role of flat bands in high-temperature superconductivity [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and quantum thermalization [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], as well as searches for novel flat-band materials [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], are also active areas of research.\n\nMany types of flat bands have been theoretically explored and classified, frequently within the tight-binding model of solids where flat bands can result from specific features in lattice geometry [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nA simple example is the one-dimensional rhombus lattice, which contains three sites per unit cell and exhibits a flat middle band that touches dispersive bands above and below (see Fig. (Figure fig:setup)a).\nAs with many flat bands, the eigenstates within the band can be written in a basis of real-space eigenfunctions known as compact localized states [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThese states are characterized by a strict boundedness on the number of sites involved in the particle wavefunction, reflecting stronger localization than the more typical exponential localization of Wannier functions.\nAt the same time, because dispersive bands are present in the band structure, an initially localized particle generically contains contributions from dispersive states and will delocalize across the lattice over time.\n\nA type of extreme localization, in which every band of the spectrum is flat, emerges in select lattices and specific values of magnetic flux, including the rhombus lattice with $\\pi$ flux.\nThe effect of magnetic flux on localization depends heavily on lattice geometry and can be understood through the Aharonov-Bohm effect.\nMore specifically, the tight-binding electron accumulates an Aharonov-Bohm phase as it hops around a closed loop of the lattice, or plaquette.\nAdditionally, the lattice plaquettes are arranged in such a way that causes complete destructive wavefunction interference beyond some region of the lattice and localizes the electron to a finite number of sites.\nThis phenomenon is known as Aharonov-Bohm \u201ccaging\u2019\u2019 [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nIn the rhombus lattice, Aharonov-Bohm caging occurs at a magnetic field of half a flux quantum through each plaquette, corresponding to a geometric phase of $\\pi$.\nAll three bands become flat and a complete basis of only compact localized states becomes possible (Fig. (Figure fig:setup)b).\nAccordingly, any initially localized particle will be in a superposition of a finite number of compact localized states and therefore will remain bounded in time.\n\nCrucially, because of strict boundedness, the key physics of Aharonov-Bohm caging can be accessed through a single plaquette of the rhombus lattice with $\\pi$ flux.\nIn this four-site system, the eigenstates (Fig. (Figure fig:setup)d) exhibit similarities to the compact localized states of its lattice counterpart, despite having energies that differ from the continuum limit.\nIn particular, none of these states extend across an entire plaquette, purely due to the same destructive wavefunction interference effects that give rise to Aharonov-Bohm caging in a lattice.\n\nIn this work, we leverage the flexible connectivity of superconducting circuits in a novel manner to realize one of these plaquettes, which we refer to as an Aharonov-Bohm cage.\nTo allow geometric phase accumulation for microwave photons, which do not inherently respond to magnetic fields due to their neutral charge, we realize a $\\pi$-flux synthetic gauge field via a negative tunneling between two sites in the plaquette.\nWe show how this negative tunneling allows us to turn on caging, by comparison to an analogous device without synthetic field.\nNext, we use on-site interactions between particles to demonstrate a bound particle pair escaping the cage.\nFinally, we find that unbound particle pairs remain caged in a multi-particle variation of Aharonov-Bohm caging.\n\n[c]0.5\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n[c]0.49\n\nFlat-band lattices and Aharonov-Bohm caging with transmon

This rotation modifies how upper (white outline) and lower (black outline) electrodes are capacitively coupled and changes the sign of the upper right tunneling term.\n(g) Experimental sequences used in this work, which consist of initialization, time evolution with all qubits on resonance, and readout. In the first experiment (white boxes), we initialize the left qubit in the first excited state and detune one of the four qubits for readout. In the second (white and yellow boxes), we instead initialize the left qubit in the second excited state with two sequential pulses. In the third experiment (white and blue boxes), we initialize the left and right qubits in the first excited state and detune two of the four qubits for simultaneous readout. In all experiments, we vary the qubits that are detuned for readout to extract average populations for each qubit.\nIn (f) and (g), subscripts L, T, B, R refer to the left, top, bottom, and right qubits, respectively.\n\nCIRCUIT DEVICE\n\nThe sites of our plaquettes are flux-tunable transmon qubits which can be approximated as anharmonic oscillators for microwave photons.\nTo implement the zero-flux rhombus plaquette, all four qubits are placed in the same orientation as shown in the main image of Fig. (Figure fig:setup)e.\nEach qubit has a large capacitor comprised of an upper and a lower electrode (shaded green), and tunnel coupling between neighboring qubits is given by capacitance between two of their electrodes.\nWith upper electrodes capacitively coupled only to lower electrodes of neighboring qubits, the accumulated phase of a single photon traversing this loop is zero.\nTo generate the $\\pi$-flux synthetic field, we rotate one transmon (the rightmost) clockwise by 90 degrees relative to the others.\nAs shown in Fig. (Figure fig:setup)f, in doing so, the (formerly) lower electrode of the right qubit now couples to the lower electrode of the top qubit, while all other electrodes remain coupled as before.\nA single photon traversing this loop then picks up an additional minus sign when hopping between the top and right sites [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], i.e. a geometric phase of $\\pi$.\nWe note that the choice of qubit to rotate and its rotation direction amount to a gauge choice, reflected in where the change in sign of tunneling occurs.\n\nThe resulting Hamiltonian for the two devices (in units where the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar=1$) is given by:\n$$\n\n\\hat{H} = &- \\sum_{\\langle i,j\\rangle} t_{ij} (b^\\dagger_i b_j + b_i b^\\dagger_j)\\nonumber\\\\\n&+ \\sum_i \\left(\\omega_i b^\\dagger_i b_i + \\frac{U_i}{2} b^\\dagger_i b_i (b^\\dagger_i b_i - 1)\\right) \\label{eq:H}\n\n$$\nwhere the summations over sites $i$ and neighboring sites $\\langle i, j\\rangle$ are taken over the left (L), top (T), bottom (B), and right (R) qubits.\nHere, $b_i$ is the bosonic annihilation operator and $\\omega_i$ is the frequency of qubit $i$.\nFor the gauge choice in this work, the tunneling $t_{ij}$ is positive between all qubits in the zero-flux rhombus.\nRotation of the rightmost qubit for the $\\pi$-flux rhombus corresponds to changing the sign of tunneling between the right and top qubits ($t_\\mathrm{RT} < 0$) while preserving its magnitude.\nOn-site attractive interactions $U_i<0$ are mediated by the negative qubit anharmonicity of transmon qubits.\nBoth devices operate in the strongly interacting regime where the ratio of interaction strength to tunneling is approximately 13.5.\nNext-nearest neighbor coupling was designed to be negligible at less than $t_{ij} / 70$ and is not included in the model.\n\nWe probe each of the two devices via two-tone spectroscopy to confirm that their eigenenergies match the expected energies obtained by exact diagonalization of the corresponding four-site Hamiltonian.\nWith all four qubits tuned into resonance with each other, we measure transmission through the feedline at the top-qubit resonator frequency while varying the frequency of the pump tone.\nTransmission peaks indicate that the resonator frequency has dispersively shifted, which occurs when the pump tone is resonant with a plaquette eigenenergy and excites the top qubit.\nThe results are shown in Figs. (Figure fig:setup)c and d for the zero- and $\\pi$-flux rhombi, respectively, and are consistent with calculation.\nThe measured spectral dependence on one of the qubit frequencies is included as Extended Data Fig. (Figure fig:spec).\n\nThe experiments that follow probe non-equilibrium dynamics and consist of state initialization, time evolution, and readout (Fig. (Figure fig:setup)g).\nFor Hamiltonian time evolution, we set the frequencies of all of the qubits to $\\omega_i/2\\pi = 4.45$ GHz.\nAt this target frequency, the qubits have depolarization times exceeding 43 $\\mu s$ and nearest-neighbor tunneling amplitudes of approximately $2\\pi\\!\\times\\!11.7$ MHz.\nState initialization and readout are performed via a single feedline (shaded purple in Fig. (Figure fig:setup)e), with four half-wave resonators (shaded yellow) dispersively coupled to each qubit.\nIn these steps, the frequency of each qubit can be dynamically set between $4.4$ and $5.7$ GHz by varying the current supplied to its individual flux bias line (shaded blue, Fig. (Figure fig:setup)e).\nA full table of device parameters can be found in Supplementary Information Tabs. (Table tab:params) and (Table tab:t).\n\nCAGING OF A SINGLE PARTICLE\n\nAharonov-Bohm caging can be made apparent through a single-particle quantum walk [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nMuch like the walk in a one-dimensional chain [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the ensuing dynamics result from wavefunction interference.\nHere, destructive interference bounds the quantum walk in an Aharonov-Bohm cage, while constructive interference allows a fully delocalized walk over all four sites of the plaquette with zero flux.\n\nThe experiment begins with initialization of the leftmost qubit, detuned from the target qubit frequency, in the first excited state (see Fig. (Figure fig:setup)d).\nThis is equivalent to placing a single particle (microwave photon) on that site.\nWe then quench the left qubit into resonance with the other three qubits at the target qubit frequency.\nAfter evolution under the Hamiltonian (Eq. <ref>) for a variable time, we diabatically detune and measure the state of one qubit.\nRepeated measurements across all qubits then provide access to the average site-resolved occupation of all four sites.\nThe results for zero and $\\pi$ flux, corrected for readout errors, are shown in Fig. (Figure fig:1particle)a and b (upper), respectively.\nDuplicate time axes are included in units of $\\tau_{\\mathrm{swap}} = 2\\pi / 4\\bar{t}$: the time it takes for a photon to swap between two qubits with tunnelling rate $\\bar{t}$, where $\\bar{t} = 2\\pi\\!\\times\\!11.75 \\,(2\\pi\\!\\times\\!11.66)$ MHz is the average rate for the zero-flux ($\\pi$-flux) device.\nSimulation results with zero on-site disorder and independently measured tunneling and decoherence are plotted below.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nAharonov-Bohm caging of a single particle. (a) Average qubit populations in the first excited state $|1\\rangle$ as a function of time after quench into resonance (upper), for the zero-flux plaquette. Appreciable populations are observed on all four sites, even at short times, indicating a fully delocalized walk. Insets show average qubit populations in the initial state and after approximately $1/2$ and $1$ swap times.\n(b) In the $\\pi$-flux plaquette, the single particle remains bounded to three of the four sites as a result of Aharonov-Bohm caging. Here insets correspond to approximately $0$, $1/\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\sqrt{2}$ swap times.\nIn both (a) and (b), simulated time evolution with zero on-site disorder is shown in the lower half.\nPopulation time series are also represented as color plots for visibility and use the colorbar in the lower right of the figure.\nDuplicate time axes are included to indicate time in units of a photon swap time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{swap}}$ (see main text for details).\nFor data in this and subsequent figures, error bars indicate 95\n\nWe find a bounded quantum walk in the $\\pi$-flux rhombus, indicating successful Aharonov-Bohm caging.\nWithin the first swap time after quench, the particle begins to delocalize over the top and bottom sites in the plaquette regardless of flux.\nShortly thereafter, however, the walks deviate.\nIn the zero-flux rhombus, the top and bottom paths constructively interfere and result in a periodic walk across all four qubits, as demonstrated by the insets in Fig. (Figure fig:1particle)a, upper.\nThis does not occur for the $\\pi$-flux rhombus: interference is destructive on the rightmost site, suppressing particle population below 5\nConsequently, the particle remains bounded to the left, top, and bottom sites (insets in Fig. (Figure fig:1particle)b, upper) as expected for caging.\n\nThe agreement between experimental measurement and simulation indicates that our control over qubit frequencies is consistent with achieving negligible on-site disorder and sufficient to realize caging.\nThe slight deviation from ideal caging is instead limited predominantly due to disorder in the coupling strengths between qubits, which amounts to a spread of approximately 2.5\nThis coupling-strength disorder results in coherent beating which is highlighted at long timescales (Extended Data Fig. (Figure fig:longtimes)).\n\nDOUBLONS ESCAPING THE CAGE\n\nWe next consider the walk of two particles initialized on the same site, referred to as a doublon.\nThese doublon states span a subspace of the entire two-particle Hilbert space; the complement is spanned by two-particle states where the particles sit on different sites, which we will refer to as \u201cparticle-particle\u201d Fock states.\nIn the presence of strong interactions, the doublon states are energetically well-separated from the particle-particle states.\nIn this subspace, doublons hop as a bound pair and experience a gauge field that is twice that of a single particle.\nThe Aharonov-Bohm cage for a single particle, then, has no effect on a strongly interacting doublon.\n\nWe access the strongly interacting regime with our devices by designing interaction energies in excess of tunneling amplitudes by an order of magnitude.\nThe doublon walk begins with two photons on the left site and continues with time evolution under the Hamiltonian as before, where on-site energies are now tuned to ensure that the second excited states of all qubits are on resonance.\nAfter a variable time, we measure the population of the second excited state and extract readout-error-corrected average doublon occupations of all sites.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nEscape of an interacting photon pair. (a) Average qubit populations in the second excited state $|2\\rangle$ as a function of time after quench into resonance (upper), for the zero-flux plaquette. The walk remains fully delocalized as with a single particle, but at reduced timescales.\n(b) Much like in the zero-flux plaquette, the doublon walk extends across the full $\\pi$-flux plaquette. (Inset plot) Direct comparison of right-qubit populations (R pop.) for doublon (2p, $|2\\rangle$ population) and single-particle (1p, $|1\\rangle$ population) walks in the $\\pi$-flux plaquette, highlighting the doublon escape in contrast to single-particle caging.\nIn both (a) and (b), inset plaquettes show average qubit populations in the initial state and after approximately $1/2$ and $1$ doublon-renormalized swap times. Simulated time evolution with zero on-site disorder, but including measured tunneling disorder and qubit decoherence, is shown in the lower half.\nThe shaded gray regions indicate the total evolution time shown in Fig. (Figure fig:1particle).\nPopulation time series are also shown as color plots for visibility and use the colorbar in the lower right of the figure.\n\nDoublons in the zero-flux rhombus delocalize in a manner qualitatively similar to single photons (Fig. (Figure fig:2particle)a).\nDoublon dynamics in the $\\pi$-flux rhombus, however, markedly differ from single-photon caging in that the doublon does not remain bounded away from the rightmost site (Fig. (Figure fig:2particle)b inset plot).\nRather, the doublon fully explores the plaquette almost as if it were in the zero-flux plaquette, i.e. it escapes this Aharonov-Bohm cage.\n\nWe note that in both plaquettes, the doublon tunneling amplitude is reduced by almost an order of magnitude compared to the single-particle tunneling.\nThese timescales result from doublons hopping via a second-order process, with rate given by $2t^2/U$ for bare tunneling $t$ and negative anharmonicity $U$.\nThis effective tunneling provides another way of understanding the doublon escape: all four tunneling rates $2t_{ij}^2/U$ have the same sign regardless of the sign of $t_{ij}$, yielding zero flux.\nAdditionally, the doublon-population oscillation amplitudes decrease over time, largely due to the weak hybridization between the doublon and particle-particle states, leading to coherent beating of the measured doublon population (see Supplementary Information for additional discussion).\n\nPARTICLE-PARTICLE FOCK-STATE CAGING\n\nFinally, we investigate the time dynamics of particle-particle Fock states and find a variation of Aharonov-Bohm caging.\nThese states, where two particles sit on different sites and are not bound by interactions, comprise the second and remaining sector of two-particle states.\nIn fact, strong interactions energetically separate these states from the doublons, making the individual particles behave approximately as hard-core bosons.\n\nFor these experiments, we initialize one photon on the left site and one photon on the right (the $|\\mathrm{LR}\\rangle$ state).\nAfter time evolution, we perform simultaneous readout on all qubit pairs to extract average particle-particle Fock-state populations at various points in time and plot the results in Fig. (Figure fig:interactingwalk)a and b.\nThe particle-particle dynamics in the zero-flux plaquette are dominated by full-contrast swaps between the $|\\mathrm{LR}\\rangle$ and $|\\mathrm{TB}\\rangle$ states.\nIn contrast, we find a bounded walk in the $\\pi$-flux plaquette not in real space, but instead characterized by suppressed population transfer to the $|\\mathrm{TB}\\rangle$ Fock state.\nWe refer to this variation of caging as \u201cFock-state caging\".\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nParticle-particle Fock-state caging (a) Average populations of each of the six particle-particle Fock states for variable time after quench into resonance. The initial state (left inset) consists of one photon on the left site and one photon on the right. Other insets show Fock-state populations at approximately $1/(2\\sqrt{2})$ and $1/\\sqrt{2}$ swap times.\nIn insets, particle-particle Fock-state populations are shown via the corresponding segment that extends across two sites of the plaquette, e.g. the horizontal segment corresponds to $|\\mathrm{LR}\\rangle$.\nThe top panel plots the population of particle-particle Fock states of next-nearest-neighbor sites, while the middle panel shows nearest-neighbor particle-particle Fock state population. (b) Same, but for the $\\pi$-flux plaquette. Insets show Fock state populations of the initial state and at approximately $1/2$ and $1$ swap times. (c) Simulated time evolution with zero flux and with zero on-site disorder for all six particle-particle Fock state combinations, incorporating measured tunneling disorder and qubit decoherence. Hamiltonian adjacency graphs depict the particle-particle dynamics. (d) Same as c, but for the $\\pi$-flux plauqette. Here, the Hamiltonian adjacency graph describes a caging-like effect where tunneling of opposite sign and states with relative phase $\\pi$ (teal shading) cause destructive interference and $|\\mathrm{TB}\\rangle$ remains unpopulated.\n\nThis bounded phenomenon is a direct consequence of Aharonov-Bohm caging extended to multi-particle sectors, seen through the corresponding Hamiltonian adjacency graphs in Figs. (Figure fig:interactingwalk)c and d.\nIn these graphs, each node represents a particle-particle Fock state; doublon states are omitted in this hard-core limit.\nTwo nodes are connected by edges if the Fock states are tunnel-coupled, and edges are weighted according to the coupling sign and magnitude.\nIn this configuration space, time evolution of the $|\\mathrm{LR}\\rangle$ state corresponds to a single-particle walk on the adjacency graph beginning on the $|\\mathrm{LR}\\rangle$ node.\nWithout a synthetic field, delocalization proceeds across the entire particle-particle subspace.\nWhereas, with $\\pi$ flux, destructive interference much like in Aharonov-Bohm caging prohibits evolution to the $|\\mathrm{TB}\\rangle$ state.\nIn other words, Fock-state caging results from the interplay of geometric phase accumulation and Fock-state configurational-space topology, rather than real-space lattice topology as in Aharonov-Bohm caging.\nIn multi-plaquette systems and the infinite lattice itself, this Fock-state caging may give rise to an interacting two-particle real-space caging effect [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]; see Extended Data Fig. (Figure fig:tripleplaquette) for supporting evidence from simulations on a chain of three plaquettes.\n\nThe oscillating populations between the $|\\mathrm{LR}\\rangle$ and $|\\mathrm{TB}\\rangle$ states in the zero-flux rhombus display a beating effect.\nThis coherent beating can be attributed to weak hybridization between the doublon and particle-particle states as in the doublon walk, reflecting a slight deviation of our device parameters from the hard-core regime (see Supplementary Information for details).\nInterestingly, the $\\pi$-flux rhombus does not host beating of these populations beyond what can be attributed to tunneling-rate disorder.\nThe absence of beating suggests that the Fock-state caging effects are independent of interaction strength.\nIn the regime of finite interactions, doublon states must be included in the adjacency graph; even so, we find that the resulting configuration-space topology maintains the complete destructive interference necessary for Fock-state caging.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nOur work experimentally demonstrates the Aharonov-Bohm caging of a single particle and the subsequent escape of deeply bound doublons from the cage.\nWe realize this cage in a rhombus plaquette by engineering a negative tunnel coupling between exactly two of the transmon qubits to thread a $\\pi$-flux synthetic magnetic field through the plaquette.\nAdditionally, we consider the correlated dynamics of two photons initialized on opposite sides of the plaquette and find a type of caging not in real space, but in the configurational space of particle-particle Fock states.\nThese results establish a critical building block for studies of all-bands-flat lattices with strong interactions [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and inform future studies in other flat-band lattices with superconducting circuits, both in one- [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and two-dimensions.\nFor example, larger system sizes and increased coherence may enable the characterization of disorder and thermalization in a flat band [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nCombined with dissipative stabilizers [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], equilibrium states may also be within reach [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nFinally, other platforms such as ultracold atoms can be used [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] to study fermions [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and nonitinerant spin models [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], implement longer-range interactions in these flat-band lattices [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], or measure transport between two reservoirs [Unknown Author,

optical lithography was used to define the base layer pattern and the features were etched with a Chlorine-based dry etch.\nJosephson junctions were patterned using electron-beam lithography and the Al-AlO$_x$-Al layers were deposited using double-angle evaporation in a Plassys MEB 550S.\nThe first arm was 20 nm thick, the AlO$_x$ was grown using a 85/15 Ar/O$_x$ mix at 200 mBar for 40 minutes, and the second aluminum layer was 70 nm thick.\nBoth devices were packaged in QDevil QCage aluminum sample holders.\nWirebonds were used to short the ground planes on opposite sides of coplanar waveguides, ground the metal in the middle of the four qubits, and bond signal traces to bondpads.\n\n## Wiring & setup\nDevices were measured sequentially in a Bluefors LD250 at a base temperature of 11 mK.\nAll time-domain control and measurements were performed using the QICK-controlled Xilinx RFSoC ZCU216 [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], including resonator and qubit drives, qubit fast-flux pulses, and single- and simultaneous multiple-cavity readout.\nDC-flux offset for each qubit was controlled using Yokogawa low-noise voltage sources, combined with a fast-flux line in the mixing chamber, and sent to the qubit via on-chip flux lines.\n\nThe qubits were dispersively read out and driven through individual half-wave resonators capacitively coupled to a single transmission line.\nCavity readout tones and qubit drive pulses were combined in a splitter at room temperature.\nThe output signal was amplified using a high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier at 4K and two amplifiers at room temperature.\nThe full wiring setup can be found in Supplementary Information Fig. (Figure fig:fridge).\n\n### Experimental sequence\nFor all experiments, DC-flux voltages were set such that in the absence of fast-flux pulses, all four qubits were approximately on resonance with one another.\nState initialization, time evolution, and readout were then performed using fast-flux pulses that control the qubit frequencies within approximately one nanosecond.\nState initialization was done by detuning only the qubits with initial-state occupation by approximately $20t$ and applying individual $\\pi$ pulses.\nTime evolution proceeded by rapidly tuning the qubits onto resonance and waiting for a variable amount of time, after which qubits were detuned by $20t$ for single-shot readout.\n\nFor the one-photon and doublon walks, we detuned and measured a single qubit to reduce effects of frequency crowding and unwanted population transfer.\nFor the particle-particle walk, two qubits were simultaneously detuned and read out to measure correlations.\nTo capture the populations of all qubit and qubit pairs, we repeat each experimental run and vary which qubit(s) are measured.\n\nAll readout consists of single-shot measurements using 3000 shots.\nReadout parameters and thresholds were optimized to discriminate between the ground and first excited states for measurements of the first-excited-state population, and between the first and second excited states for measurements of the second-excited-state population.\nAveraging time for readout was 2.5 $\\mu$s.\n\n### DC-flux crosstalk calibration\nWe calibrated and compensated for DC-flux crosstalk as in  [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nWe find a non-negligible crosstalk of around 2\nThe full crosstalk matrix for the $\\pi$-flux device is shown in Supplementary Information Fig. (Figure fig:xc); the crosstalk matrix for the zero-flux device is similar.\n\n### Fast-flux calibration\nThe fast-flux pulses used to tune qubit frequencies during the experimental sequence ideally have step-function responses.\nWe calibrated for long-time deviations from the ideal step pulse as in  [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and short-time deviations as in  [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nOne and two-photon oscillations between two qubits before and after these compensations are plotted in Supplementary Information Fig. (Figure fig:FF).\n\n### Qubit tuning into resonance\nThe four qubits were first biased approximately into resonance using DC-flux currents.\nTo compensate for frequency disorder, we fine-tuned the qubit frequencies using fast-flux pulses through a heuristic algoritm.\nWe first set the bottom qubit to a frequency near its sweet spot and varied the step amplitude of a fast-flux pulse to bring the left qubit into resonance, probed via a single-particle two-qubit walk.\nNext we brought the top qubit into resonance, probed via the dynamics of a single particle initialized on the left qubit and optimized for balanced measurement probabilities on the top and bottom qubits.\nFinally, we brought the right qubit into resonance, verified through comparison with simulated plaquette dynamics.\n\n### Hamiltonian estimation & simulation\nAll of the parameters used in the Hamiltonian time-domain simulations were independently measured.\nTo determine tunneling amplitudes between neighboring qubit pairs, we performed a single-particle two-qubit walk with the nonparticipating qubits detuned by at least $250$ MHz.\nThis walk was also used to determine approximate $T_2$ dephasing times for the coupled plaquette systems, which have a reduced flux dispersion compared to that of an individual qubit [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThe $T_1$ coherence time was individually measured at the target frequency.\nSimulations use the QuTiP package [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\naddtoresetfiguresection\n\nEXTENDED DATA\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nTwo-tone spectroscopy data for the (a) zero- and (b) $\\pi$-flux rhombus devices. In both, the DC voltage on one of the qubit flux lines is varied, keeping the other three qubit frequencies in resonance with one another. Then, the pump tone frequency is varied while the transmission at the top qubit readout resonator frequency $\\omega_{r,0}$ is monitored. Increased transmission corresponds to the pump tone being on resonance with one of the four-qubit-system eigenfrequencies because it shifts the qubit readout resonator frequency away from the probe tone frequency.

The interacting walk covers all particle-particle Fock states over time.\n(b) With the $\\pi$-flux field, the interacting walk never evolves to exhibit population on the analogous $|\\mathrm{TB}\\rangle$-like state (purple). Furthermore, this photon-photon state appears to remain bounded; the leftmost and rightmost sites of the system remain unpopulated at all points in time (purple). Simulations use the average tunnel couplings and interactions energies for each device, respectively, and omit disorder and dephasing.

The labels L, T, B, R correspond to the left, top, bottom, and right qubits, respectively.\n\nThe qubit target frequency was chosen to reduce frequency sensitivity to flux bias and optimize qubit coherence.\nThe former consideration merits proximity to a qubit sweet spot, while the second requires avoiding frequency resonances with lossy two-level systems in the device material that are physically proximal to one of the four qubits.\nFor both devices, we select a qubit target frequency of 4.45 GHz.\n\n## Wiring & setup\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nControl and measurement wiring setup.\n\nThe wiring and measurement setup is in Fig. (Figure fig:fridge), discussed in the Methods, and is generally similar to the setup used in similar works.\nWe highlight the use of the Xilinx RFSoC ZCU216, with software control through the QICK package [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], for arbitrary waveform generation of the fast-flux pulses, qubit drives, and qubit readout probe.\nThis board is also used for signal digitization, greatly simplifying the microwave hardware requirements for the setup.\nWe elaborate also on the modified bias-tee to combine the DC and fast-flux lines in the mixing chamber; here, the capacitor was removed and replaced with a short.\n\n## Device flux calibrations\nWe characterize and compensate for both DC-flux crosstalk and distortions in the fast-flux pulse shape, as described in the Methods.\nThe measured DC-flux cross-coupling matrix for the $\\pi$-flux device is shown in Fig. (Figure fig:xc); we note that the zero-flux device exhibits a similar matrix.\n\n0.35\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n0.6\nFlux line cross-coupling matrix for the four qubits on the $\\pi$-flux rhombus device. Note that the color for the diagonal elements is saturated on the colorbar. The matrix for the zero-flux rhombus is qualitatively similar.\n\nIn Fig. (Figure fig:FF) we plot the top qubit response to the fast-flux pulse before and after its calibration.\nWe additionally evaluate the performance of fast-flux pulses through single-particle and doublon walks over two qubits, where the initially excited qubit is brought into resonance with the second qubit via the fast-flux pulse.\nIn these evaluations, the fast-flux pulse amplitude is varied and subsequent excitation population over time measured.\nBecause oscillations are the slowest when the qubits are on resonance, the single-qubit walk reveals imperfections in the fast-flux pulse when the optimal fast-flux amplitude appears to vary over time.\nSimilarly, asymmetric oscillation contrast for fast-flux setpoints above and below resonance reflects imperfections in the fast-flux pulse.\nWe find that both of these effects are qualitatively eliminated post-calibration.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nFast-flux calibration for $\\pi$-flux rhombus device, top qubit. (a) Spectroscopically measured qubit response as a function of time for pre- and post-calibration fast-flux pulses. Dashed lines are included as a guide to the eye and connect the experimentally measured points. The horizontal gray line is also included as a guide to the eye. (b) (upper) Swapping of qubit excitation between the top and left qubits, where the top qubit is initialized in the first excited state. After initialization, a step function is applied to the fast-flux line of the top qubit with varying amplitude (\u201cFF step amplitude\u201d, $y$-axis). The time-dependent fast-flux amplitude corresponding to the slowest swap over time, plus the reduced contrast of off-resonance swapping, indicates that the fast-flux pulse requires calibration. (lower) Same, but for a swap of the second excited state. (c) Same as (a), but with the calibrated fast-flux pulse.\n\n## Readout Parameters\nWe determine qubit state occupancy using the state-dependent dispersive shift of the corresponding readout resonator.\nTo calibrate, we initialize the qubit into the $|0\\rangle$, $|1\\rangle$, or $|2\\rangle$ state using $\\pi$ pulses between adjacent levels and measure the resulting quadrature I/Q signal.\nReadout tone frequencies, powers, and averaging times are separately optimized for discrimination between the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ states, versus the $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$ states.\nIn the single-particle and interacting particle-particle dynamics, we optimize for separability between the $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ state I/Q signals as seen in Fig. (Figure fig:SS)a.\nFor the doublon dynamics, we optimize for separability between the $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$ states as seen in Fig. (Figure fig:SS)b.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nState-dependent quadrature I/Q measurements when optimizing for separability of different states. (a) A readout tone frequency of 7.2305 GHz optimizes differentiation of the $|0\\rangle$ state from the $|1\\rangle$ and $|2\\rangle$ states. (b) A readout tone frequency of 7.2300 GHz isolates the $|2\\rangle$ state best and is used for measuring doublon dynamics. In both cases, the averaging time for each measurement was 2.5 $\\mu s$. Dashed line indicates the threshold used for assigning single-shot measurements to the qubit state populations.\n\nWe use separately measured readout fidelities for each qubit to correct for readout error on that qubit.\nAcross all four qubits and both devices, the average readout fidelity for distinguishing the $|0\\rangle$ from the $|1\\rangle$ state is 86(2)\nWe note the reduced readout fidelity for the second excited state predominantly results from the lower $T_1$ coherence time for higher qubit levels.\nHigher readout fidelities could be achieved using a near-quantum-limited amplifier [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and reduced measurement time.\n\nFor simultaneous readout of two qubits, we perform a similar calibration where we initialize in the product states $|00\\rangle$, $|01\\rangle$, $|10\\rangle$, and $|11\\rangle$ and concurrently measure the resulting quadrature I/Q signals for the two corresponding readout resonators.\nThe two qubits are detuned from each other to suppress coupling during readout; in particular, nearest neighbors are detuned by at least 200 MHz.\nThese readout frequencies differ from that of single-qubit readout; correspondingly, readout-tone frequencies and powers are reoptimized.\nThe measurement averaging time remains the same.\nFor all qubit pairs, each qubit's measurement fidelity is independent of the state of the other and consistent with its single-qubit measurement fidelity.\n\n## Effective Dephasing Rates\nWe estimate the effective $T_\\varphi$ of our coupled system as in [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] because coupled systems have reduced flux dispersion compared to that of individual qubits.\nTo do this, we use single-photon oscillations between the zero-flux left (L) and bottom (B) qubits when both are tuned to the target qubit frequency.\nUnder the simplification that both qubits have the same effective dephasing rate $T_{\\varphi}$, the expected left-qubit first-excited-state population over time $\\tau$ can be written as:\n$$\n\nP_L(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{cos}(2t\\tau)\\mathrm{exp}(-\\frac{\\tau}{2T_{1, L}} - \\frac{\\tau}{2T_{1, B}} - \\frac{\\tau}{T_{\\varphi}}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{exp}(-\\frac{\\tau}{2T_{1, L}} - \\frac{\\tau}{2T_{1, B}})\n\n$$\nfor a coupling rate $t$ and depolarization times $T_{1,L}$ and $T_{1,B}$ for the left and bottom qubits, respectively.\nWith our independently measured $T_{1,L}$ and $T_{1,B}$ values, we vary the dephasing time and compare the exponentially decaying envelope of $P_L(\\tau)$ to measurement as seen in Fig. (Figure fig:T2eff).\nWe find that $T_\\varphi$ values between 40 $\\mu s$ and 80 $\\mu s$ are consistent with the data.\nGiven that single-qubit $T_2$ times are on the higher end of the $T_2$ values across all eight qubits in both devices, we use 40 $\\mu s$ as the effective dephasing rate of the coupled system for both devices.\nFor doublon dynamics, we use $T_\\varphi = 20 \\mu s$ because the flux dispersion is approximately twice that of the ground-to-first-excited-state transition.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSingle-photon oscillations between left and bottom qubits, with envelopes from the analytical model corresponding to various $T_\\varphi$ dephasing times. Comparisons of the upper and lower bounds of the envelopes to data suggest 40 $\\mu s$ as a suitable lower bound for $T_\\varphi$ and 80 $\\mu s$ as a reasonable upper bound.\n\n## Interaction-induced coherent beating\nHere we elaborate on the observed beating of oscillations in the measured doublon populations of main text Fig. (Figure fig:2particle) and particle-particle populations of main text Fig. (Figure fig:interactingwalk).\n\nThese are perhaps best understood through the energy eigenbases of these systems.\nMore specifically, the qualitative models presented in the main text treat the doublon subspace as a decoupled subspace from the particle-particle subspace; however, this is only true in the limit of infinite interaction strength.\nFor finite interactions, the energy eigenstates are hybridized between states in the two subspaces, albeit weakly for strong interactions.\nFurthermore, this hybridization shifts the eigenstate energies.\nThen, because the initial Fock states are superpositions of numerous energy eigenstates, time evolution under the Hamiltonian results in differing phase accumulation between the eigenstates, resulting in the coherent beating of population oscillations.\nWe note that the visibility of coherent beating is also a consequence of finite-size effects as there are simply fewer energy eigenstates to cause full dephasing.\n\nWe find in the bound two-photon walk, a weak detuning the left or right qubit significantly suppresses the $2\\mu$s-timescale beating.\nFig. (Figure fig:detunedsite) shows the experimentally measured dynamics of a doublon with the right qubit detuned by $0.2$ MHz, along with simulations with and without this detuning for comparison.\nThe sensitivity to detuning suggests that it breaks a degeneracy of the system or further perturbs the eigensystem in a way that reduces the observed beating effect.\n\n0.55\nTwo-photon walk with single site detuned. (a) Experimental measurement of a two-photon walk on the $\\pi$ plaquette taken over the same timescale as main text Fig. (Figure fig:2particle). Notably, the amplitude of oscillations on sites L and R is larger at long times compared to the data presented in the main text. However, this behavior can be reproduced in simulation (b) by detuning the on-site energy of sites L or R by as little as $0.2$ MHz. (c) Simulation of two-photon walk with all four qubits on resonance, identical to Fig. (Figure fig:2particle)b lower, for easy reference.\n\n0.40\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n## Photon-photon dynamics\nIn the main text, we qualitatively represent the interacting particle-particle walk through the Hamiltonian adjacency graph.\nEach state in the Fock-state subspace is treated as a site, with coupling strengths and signs inherited from the interacting two-particle Hamiltonian.\nTime evolution of an initial Fock state in the Hamiltonian, then, corresponds to single-particle evolution on the graph, initialized on the corresponding site.\nWe note that such approaches can also be used to experimentally simulate interacting particle systems [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]; however they scale unfavorably with particle number.\n\nAn alternative approach to understanding the interacting particle-particle walk examines the eigenstates of the Fock-state subspace as depicted in Fig. (Figure fig:photphotdyn).\nThe zero-flux plaquette eigenspectrum exhibits three energies, each of which has an eigenstate (outlined in yellow) that has nonzero overlap with the $|\\mathrm{LR}\\rangle$ Fock state: that is, nonzero overlap with the initial state of a particle on the left site and a particle on the right site.\nTime evolution of the superposition of these states results in nonzero probability amplitudes of all Fock states in this subspace at some point in time.\nWith $\\pi$ flux, the eigenspectrum still exhibits three distinct energy values, only two of which have eigenstates that overlap with $|\\mathrm{LR}\\rangle$.\nFurthermore, they both have zero probability amplitude of the $|\\mathrm{TB}\\rangle$ state. As a result, we do not expect to simultaneously observe a particle on the top site and a particle on the bottom site at any point in time (in the limit of zero disorder and dephasing).\n\n0.5\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n0.49\nPhysics of photon-photon dynamics in the rhombus systems. (a) Two-particle eigenstates for the zero-flux plaquette, in the subspace where particles occupy different sites. Three eigenstates, outlined, exhibit nonzero probability amplitude of the $|\\mathrm{LR}\\rangle$ Fock state. (b) Same as (a), but for the $\\pi$-flux plaquette. Here, only two eigenstates exhibit nonzero probability amplitude of the $|\\mathrm{LR}\\rangle$ Fock state.\n\n## Increasing particle number\nHere we consider particle number $n > 2$ on the $\\pi$-rhombus plaquette.\nFigure (Figure fig:largerN)a shows the eigenenergies for $n=1$ to $n=5$ particles on the plaquette for a ratio of interaction strength to tunneling of $U/t = 13.5$, which is the approximate ratio of our experimental devices.\nFor a given particle number, the eigenenergies are largely grouped around integer values of the interaction energy $U$.\nCorrespondingly, the grouped eigenstates approximately reflect different Fock-state partitions of the $n$ particles over the four sites, labeled in the subfigure.\nFor example, $n=3$ particles can be partitioned by placing all three particles on one site (\u201c3\u201d, with four Fock states); two particles on one site and one particle on a different site (\u201c2+1\u201d, with twelve Fock states), or all three particles on unique sites (\u201c1+1+1\u201d, with four Fock states).\nBecause interactions are the dominant energy of the system, the respective eigenenergies are then close to $3U$, $U$, and $0$ (due to three, two, and no interacting particles on one of the sites).\nAt the same time, we are not strictly in the hard-core limit of infinite interaction strength; as a result, these partition subspaces are not completely uncoupled and there is weak hybridization between them.\nIn other words, the eigenstates labelled with a given partition do contain nonzero overlap with Fock states of different partitions.\n\nWe numerically simulate the dynamics of initial Fock states within each of these partitions to examine whether real-space or Fock-space caging occurs.\nFor finite interactions $U=13.5t$, we first consider dynamics across the entire Hilbert space.\nWe find that within each Fock-space partition there exists at least one initial Fock state for which real-space or Fock-space caging occurs (see Fig. (Figure fig:largerN)b).\nThis caging can be understood through examining the corresponding Hamiltonian adjacency graphs for the entire Hilbert space; Fig. (Figure fig:largerN)c shows the graphs for $n=2$ and $n=3$.\nFurthermore, this ubiquitous caging property persists for all nonzero interaction strengths.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nAdding particles to the $\\pi$-rhombus plaquette.\n(a) Energy spectra for particle number $n=1$ to $n=5$. Points are offset horizontally slightly for visibility. Colors correspond to the presence or absence of caging within the corresponding approximate Fock-state partition subspace, in the hard-core limit (see text for details).\n(b) Tabulation of Fock states that are caged and the Fock states that they never reach, separated by blockaded arrows.\n\nStates that are outlined in blue exhibit real-space caging, while those outlined in green exhibit Fock-state caging. Caging from states that are neither highlighted nor outlined can be understood through the Hamitonian adjacency graph in (c). For simplicity, we do not include the caged states that can be mapped onto the ones shown under the symmetries of the plaquette.\n(c) Hamiltonian adjacency graphs for the entire Hilbert space for $n=2$ and $n=3$.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Power and Temperature Sweeps' section of the paper.", "completion": "While the applications of some microwave resonators, e.g. photon detectors or MKIDs, are at high photon numbers, quantum information applications require operation at single photon occupation. Power sweeps down to the single photon regime are necessary to measure TLS loss and predict how the devices would perform in qubit circuits. It can be very difficult to determine the actual power within the resonator, but estimation methods exist. The average number of photons in the resonator can be estimated from the power at the input of the resonator, applied power $P_{\\mathrm{app}}$, as <cit.>:\n$$\n\n< n > = \\frac{< E_{int} >}{\\hbar \\omega_0} = \\frac{2}{\\hbar \\omega_0^2} \\frac{Z_0}{Z_r} \\frac{Q^2}{Q_c} P_{\\mathrm{app}},\n\n$$\nwhere $Z_0$ is the characteristic impedance of the microwave environment to which the resonator is coupled, $Z_r$ is the resonator characteristic impedance, and $< E_{int} >$ is the average energy stored within the resonator.\n\nTo understand the dominant loss mechanism in a resonator material system, it takes much more than measuring loss at the lowest cryostat temperature at single photon powers. Measuring the temperature and power dependence of loss can be used to elucidate a great deal about the dominant loss mechanism present in the device under test. Both power and temperature sweeps can be used to fit for TLS loss in a superconducting microwave resonator. By measuring loss as a function of power at a temperature well below where the TLS are unsaturated, $T_{bath} \\ll \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2k_{B}}$, the TLS model in Eq.\u00a0<ref> can be used to determine $\\delta_{TLS}^0$. Additionally, measuring loss as a function of temperature at low powers and fitting to the same equation yields similar results. Ideally, fits to the saturation of both temperature and power dependent loss are measured to find self-consistent results. Deviations could be an indication that an assumption about the temperature or power at the device are not accurate <cit.>.\n\nIn addition to dependence on loss, the frequency of the resonator itself can shift depending on microscopic loss effects among the ensemble of TLS. In [Gao, Jiansong, \"The physics of superconducting microwave resonators\", 2008], a method is shown to measure resonance frequency shift as a function of temperature at any power and fit to Eq.\u00a0<ref> to determine $\\delta_{TLS}^0$. However, [Pappas, David P, Vissers, Michael R, Wisbey, David S, Kline, Jeffrey S, Gao, Jiansong, \"Two level system loss in superconducting microwave resonators\", 2011] states that measuring loss as a function of power or temperature determines the TLS loss in a narrow frequency band near resonance, while measuring resonance frequency as a function of temperature determines wide-band TLS loss. Since the off-resonance TLS remain unsaturated, the measurement can be performed at powers far above the single photon limit required by other measurements, reducing measurement time.\n\nAccurate extraction of TLS loss from temperature sweep data is only possible when the frequency shift is dominated by TLS around $T_{bath} \\sim \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{2k_{B}}$. This condition is met by Nb resonators with the characteristic hook shape seen in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:TLSTheoCurves) and Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:experimental_scurve). However, for lower $T_c$ materials such as Al, a frequency shift in the opposite direction can arise from large thermal quasiparticle population in the superconductor. From Eq.\u00a0<ref>, increased temperature leads to decrease in frequency and quality factor, as shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Quasiparticle_temp_expt). When both effects are present, such as in [Chang, Josephine B, Vissers, Michael R, C\u00f3rcoles, Antonio D, Sandberg, Martin, Gao, Jiansong, Abraham, David W, Chow, Jerry M, Gambetta, Jay M, Beth Rothwell, Mary, Keefe, George A, others, \"Improved superconducting qubit coherence using titanium nitride\", 2013], the anomalous temperature-dependent shifts will produce fits with unphysical TLS loss extraction results. Therefore, superconductors of low $T_c$ and high kinetic inductance are not suitable for using temperature sweeps to study TLS loss. On the other hand, there exist regimes in which TLS loss is sufficiently small compared to conductor loss that temperature sweeps reveal much more about properties of the superconductor than TLS loss of nearby materials <cit.>.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nPower and temperature dependence of the loss of a Nb on $\\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ microstrip resonator with an interlayer of sputtered $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$ <cit.>.

CPW resonator loss as a function of width of the gap between conductor and ground plane for the highest performance device of each type. Solid markers: $F \\delta_{\\mathrm{TLS}}^0$ values. Open markers: $\\delta_{\\mathrm{LP}}$ values. Superconducting microwave resonators patterned from Al (circles), TiN (squares), Nb (diamonds), and other superconductors (stars) are shown. Marker color denotes reference in which each measurement is reported, with associated colors and references shown in Table\u00a0(Table tab:metalstable). Grey curves are guides to the eye showing a rough linear correlation between gap and $F$, with dark grey curve denoting the current performance limit of on-chip superconducting microwave resonators.\n\nTables summarizing a selection of existing measurements in literature for $\\delta_{LP}$ and $F \\delta^0_{TLS}$ are given for deposited dielectrics (Table (Table tab:dielectricstable)) and interfaces associated with thin film superconducting metals (Table (Table tab:metalstable) and Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:review_scatter)). Conductor loss limits are listed in Table\u00a0(Table tab:bulkmetalstable). Variables not satisfactorily accounted for in these comparisons include the impact of resonator geometry and filling factor, resonance frequency, $Q_{i}/Q_{c}$ matching, miscellaneous fabrication differences, the presence or absence of magnetic shielding, IR filtering and isolation, and differences in measurement base temperature and sample thermalization. In particular, in order to compare results across experiments, the filling factor of the TLS material must be known. For CPWs, the filling factor can be estimated from the conductor width $w$ and gap $g$ between the conductor and ground planes, where $F \\propto w,g$ roughly holds. For experiments that only report the low power loss, in order to compare to TLS loss values, the high-power loss must be orders of magnitude smaller than the low power loss, and it must be demonstrated that the low power regime is being reached.\n\nOf special note, uncontrolled thermalization, unwanted noise, and unshielded magnetic fields can lead to systematic under- or over-reporting of loss. It is the opinion of the authors that, at minimum, base temperature and power dependent sweeps be published along with filling factors of the TLS material, $Q_c$, and resonator fitting information. Other parameters that would be highly useful include etch type and material deposition parameters.\n\nDue to the numerous variables affecting the reported loss values, is it difficult to make definite conclusions from literature comparisons. However, some trends can be seen. They are outlined below along with noteworthy results from individual studies."}

This in turn imparts the possibility to perform certain computational tasks and quantum simulations which are outside the reach of modern supercomputers [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Superconducting qubits \u2013 collective excitations in superconducting circuits \u2013 are currently one of the leading approaches for realizing quantum logic elements and quantum coherent interactions with sufficiently high controllability and low noise to be a viable candidate for implementing medium and large-scale quantum computation.\n\nIn 2014, the first controlled qubit-qubit interaction with fidelities greater than 0.99 in multi-qubit systems was demonstrated\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] with the transmon qubit\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] variant of superconducting qubits, and since then, multiple controlled two-qubit interactions have been demonstrated with similarly high fidelities (e.g. Refs.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]). Even though the two-qubit gate fidelity in multi-qubit systems is a limited metric for evaluating the maturity of a quantum computing technology, it implies a high degree of control of all aspects of the quantum processor, and indicates the state of play: superconducting qubits are well positioned to be a platform for demonstrating interesting noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing (NISQ) [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] protocols outside the reach of classical computers and first realizations of operations on multiple logical error-corrected qubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nPath towards fault-tolerant quantum error-corrected quantum computers (left) as well as noisy intermediate scale quantum computing (right) using superconducting qubits. The left track follows the path towards quantum computers capable of performing arbitrarily long programs to arbitrary precision, based on logical (i.e. encoded and error-corrected) qubits. The right track is the `NISQ' approach (see Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]), where highly optimized quantum algorithms and quantum simulations, which typically take into account details of the quantum processor, can be executed without generalized quantum error correction procedures. The two tracks are pursued in parallel in many academic, government, and industrial laboratories.\n\nIn Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:NISQ-QEC), we show two major tracks being pursued in parallel in the community. The left track (see e.g. Refs.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]) shows the progression towards building a fault-tolerant quantum computer, capable of running an arbitrarily long computation, to arbitrary precision. Since 2012-2013, the field has climbed this ladder, including the recent demonstration of a logical qubit with a lifetime longer than any of the underlying constituent elements [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], operations on single logical qubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] as well as logical operations between two encoded (but not yet error-corrected) qubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nAlthough the architectures based purely on the transmon qubit (see Sec.\u00a0<ref>) have not yet demonstrated logical states with longer lifetimes than their constituent physical states, multi-qubit systems with on the order of 10 \u2013 20 qubits have been demonstrated\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and even larger systems with 50 \u2013 100 qubits are under current development\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Such processors are eminently suitable for the NISQ era approach, where the aim is to perform quantum algorithms and quantum simulations that achieve quantum advantage in the absence of full quantum error correction. Such NISQ era demonstrations utilize highly tailored quantum programs that take into account detailed knowledge of a given quantum processor, some of which we have shown in the right track of Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:NISQ-QEC). These (and more) details will need to be combined judiciously to ultimately demonstrate non-trivial physics (i.e. quantum simulations) or calculations (i.e. quantum algorithms) in the NISQ approach. The full toolbox of the NISQ era is an area under active development, and the ultimate reach of this approach is not yet known. Prominent among the NISQ demonstrations is the recent result of demonstrating a clear quantum advantage (nicknamed `quantum supremacy'\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]), where a computation performed on a quantum computer yields a result expected to be impossible to attain using large, classical supercomputers\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn this review, we do not aspire to give a complete, chronological review of the entire field of superconducting qubits and their broad applicability for implementing circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) or as a platform for studying fundamental physics.

Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY 10598, USA\n\nAs superconducting quantum circuits scale to larger sizes, the problem of frequency crowding proves a formidable task. Here we present a solution for this problem in fixed-frequency qubit architectures. By systematically adjusting qubit frequencies post-fabrication, we show a nearly ten-fold improvement in the precision of setting qubit frequencies. To assess scalability, we identify the types of `frequency collisions' that will impair a transmon qubit and cross-resonance gate architecture. Using statistical modeling, we compute the probability of evading all such conditions, as a function of qubit frequency precision. We find that without post-fabrication tuning, the probability of finding a workable lattice quickly approaches 0. However with the demonstrated precisions it is possible to find collision-free lattices with favorable yield. These techniques and models are currently employed in available quantum systems and will be indispensable as systems continue to scale to larger sizes.\n\n## Introduction\nRealizing robust large-scale quantum information processors  is one of the foremost challenges in quantum science. Many practical applications have been proposed for robust quantum computers, including estimating the ground state energy of chemical compounds and implementing machine learning algorithms [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Quantum advantage relative to classical computers can be realized without full fault-tolerance, but requires large quantum circuits that a classical computer cannot simulate [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Recent demonstrations have shown qubit circuits nearly at the threshold for demonstrating quantum advantage [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Much work remains in order to realize fault-tolerant quantum processors; however,  scale-up of solid-state quantum circuits has shown consistent and ongoing progress [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. As the qubit circuits are scaled up, they must maintain high one- and two-qubit gate fidelities, high qubit connectivity, and low cross-talk error which can be measured in a holistic sense via the quantum volume of the circuit [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Lattices of fixed-frequency transmon qubits represent a promising architecture for building systems of larger sizes [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. A growing number of systems at the 20 to 50-qubit scale are now available to users through cloud access. A variety of technical challenges confront further system scaling, including improving 3-dimensional circuit integration and qubit coherence. High on the list of such challenges is the issue of `frequency crowding.'\n\nFixed frequency transmon qubits using the two-qubit cross-resonance (CR) gate form a promising architecture for scaling up quantum systems. Fixed-frequency transmons are largely insensitive to charge or flux noise, and have achieved coherence times of 100 $\\mu$s and growing. The CR gate, a hardware-efficient all-microwave gate [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], is readily used to entangle these qubits with gate fidelities above 99\n\nMaintaining high gate fidelities for all pairs in a lattice will require solving this `frequency crowding' problem by precise setting of qubit frequencies to specified values, as characterized by a standard deviation $\\sigma_f$. To achieve low $\\sigma_f$, the tunnel-junction conductance must be controlled with high precision. Transmon frequency $f_{01}$ follows $h f_{01} \\simeq \\sqrt{8 E_J E_C} - E_C$, where Josephson energy $E_J = \\frac{\\hbar I_c}{2 e}$ is many times greater than charging energy $E_C = \\frac{e^2}{2 C}$ [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In typical transmons, a photolithographically defined capacitance $C$ has dimensions in the tens to hundreds of microns and varies little from qubit to qubit. The critical current $I_c$ is set by a tunnel barrier of area $\\sim$ 100 $\\times$ 100 nm and thickness a few nm, and is thus challenging to fabricate with precision better than a few percent [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, tunnel barrier resistance $R_n$ is readily measurable to precision better than 0.1\n\nCareful design of lattices can enable error correction codes while at the same time minimizing the likelihood of `frequency collisions' and therefore the required $\\sigma_f$ for fabrication yield [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Yet even the most robust designs require a fractional $\\sigma_f$  of 0.25\n\nIn this paper, we introduce an adaptive post-fabrication trimming technique that we use to incrementally adjust $R_n$ on a qubit-by-qubit basis, thereby overcoming inherent variability in both initial qubit fabrication and the laser anneal. For the first time, an improvement in qubit frequency precision is demonstrated in terms of narrowed frequency distributions. Crucially, we demonstrate qubit frequency imprecision $\\sigma_f$ of the same magnitude as the imprecision of predicting $f_{01}$ from $R_n$. To estimate the scalability of this technique for the fabrication of error-corrected lattices, we employ a statistical yield model based on $\\sigma_f$ relative to specific collision bounds. This model predicts the severity of the frequency crowding problem for different topologies and scales of error corrected multi-qubit lattices as a function of code distance. The model demonstrates that using conventional transmon fabrication, scaled-up qubit lattices will fail to evade `frequency collisions'. However, our novel trimming technique achieves adequate $\\sigma_f$ for scalable fabrication of distance-3 through distance-7 heavy-square and heavy-hexagon codes. In particular, this technique enables the high yield fabrication of the distance-3 and distance-5 heavy-hexagon lattices currently deployed as IBM cloud connected systems [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n## Results\nFrequency Precision $\\sigma_f$ From Transmon Fabrication\n\nTo assess the $\\sigma_f$ resulting from qubit fabrication, we developed a test vehicle containing a large number of identically-fabricated qubits (<ref>). We cooled the chip in a dilution refrigerator and used dispersive readout through half-wave microwave resonators to measure qubit frequencies [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. We measured the frequencies of 31 qubits to a precision better than 100 kHz using a Ramsey fringe method. The qubit frequencies had random variation $\\sigma_f = 132.3$ MHz (<ref>), or 2.3\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Chip type used to assess $\\sigma_f$. False-colored image. 36 fixed-frequency transmon qubits, each including a 500 $\\times$ 320 micron planar capacitor and a $\\sim 0.1 \\times 0.1$ micron Al/AlOx/Al tunnel junction, are prepared identically on a 20 $\\times$ 10 mm Si substrate. A half-wavelength coplanar waveguide resonator at each qubit enables dispersive readout. Resonators are frequency-multiplexed in groups of 12. (b) Transmon frequency vs $R_n$.

Initial median was 5.7025 GHz and spread $\\sigma_f = 132.3$ MHz (red histogram, 70 MHz bins). Using selective laser-anneal (figure (Figure fig:LaserTuneSchematic)) we prepared these qubits into two distinct frequency populations with medians 5.430 and 5.7046 GHz. (Black histograms, 10 MHz bins) Each population is outlined by a gaussian curve centered at its local median frequency. Combined spread is $\\sigma_f = 14.0$ MHz.\n\n### Tuning Using Selective Laser Anneal\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Schematic of apparatus, \u201cLaser Annealing of Stochastically Impaired Qubits\u201d (LASIQ). A 532 nm (frequency doubled) diode-pumped solid-state laser is used as the laser annealing source. Active power calibration is accomplished via a half-wave plate and PBS combination, with feedback from a Si-PD. A piezoelectric mirror mount actively aligns the beam to the junction center via image pattern recognition . The beam is shaped as necessary to avoid direct illumination of the junction, and beam size is condensed $4\\times$ using a dual-objective setup [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. (b) Iterative anneal demonstration. Adaptive anneal progression towards $R_n$ targets in 20 tunnel junctions. Greater fractional tuning requires greater anneal powers and anneal numbers. Abbreviations: SHG: second harmonic generation, PBS: polarizing beam splitter, Si-PD: silicon photodiode, AM: alignment mirror, BS: beam shaper, TEC: thermoelectric cooler.\n\nTo reduce $\\sigma_f$, we developed a technique for selective laser anneal to shift tunnel resistance $R_n$ by pre-calibrated increments. (See <ref> and <ref>). We demonstrate the achievable frequency control of this technique by shifting the 31 measured qubits into a two-frequency pattern. We employed an $R_n$ vs $f$ correlation (<ref>) to designate the target resistances. We shifted 16 junctions to one target $R_n$ and 15 to another target $R_n$. After tuning, the group of 16 junctions had median resistance 7.984 k$\\Omega$ and the group of 15 had median resistance 8.798 k$\\Omega$. The 31 junctions reached their targets with an overall precision of $\\sigma_R = 51 \\Omega$, about 0.61\n\n## Discussion\nOur post-fabrication trimming reduced $\\sigma_f$ by 9.5$\\times$ compared to initial fabrication. To assess whether this level of precision is sufficient to reliably prepare lattices of fixed-frequency transmons capable of error-correcting codes, we must quantify the frequency-crowding problem. Transmon qubits are weakly anharmonic and have decreasing transition energies at higher levels. Therefore, degeneracies among the $\\ket{0} \\rightarrow \\ket{1}$, $\\ket{1} \\rightarrow \\ket{2}$ and $\\ket{0} \\rightarrow \\ket{2}$ transitions of nearby qubits can all contribute to `frequency collisions.' We must consider the relative frequencies of both nearest-neighbors and next-nearest-neighbors in the lattice [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Fig (Figure fig:lattices_and_freqs) illustrates the relative positions of nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor qubits in a section of lattice, and <ref> lists the seven cases most likely to lead to gate errors [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. We can think of them qualitatively as follows: Type 1 causes hybridization of states in $Q_j$ and $Q_k$, while in type 2 the CR pulse excites $Q_j$ into the non-computational $\\ket{2}$ state. Type 3 excites $Q_k$ to the $\\ket{2}$ state, but does not require a CR tone. In condition 4, $ZX$ is weak, which implies long gate times and increased gate error [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In type 5, the CR gate addresses an additional neighboring qubit. In type 6, when one qubit is the target of a CR gate, its next-nearest-neighbor leaks to the $\\ket{2}$ state. Type 7 causes $Q_j$ to leak to the $\\ket{2}$ state during a CR gate.\n\nType     Definition     Participants     Bounds\n[0.5ex]\n1     $f_{j,01} = f_{k,01}$     Nearest-neighbor qubits $Q_j$, $Q_k$     $\\pm$ 17 MHz\n\n2     $f_{j,02} = 2f_{k,01}$     Control qubit $Q_j$, target qubit $Q_k$     $\\pm$ 4 MHz\n\n3     $f_{j,01} = f_{k,12}$     Nearest-neighbor qubits $Q_j$, $Q_k$     $\\pm$ 30 MHz\n\n4     $f_{k,01} < f_{j,12}$ or $f_{j,01} < f_{k,01}$      Control qubit $Q_j$, target qubit $Q_k$     \u2014\n\n5     $f_{i,01} = f_{k,01}$     $Q_j$ is control to $Q_i$ and/or $Q_k$ & is nearest-neighbor to both.     $\\pm$ 17 MHz\n\n6     $f_{i,01} = f_{k,12}$ or $f_{i,12} = f_{k,01}$     $Q_j$ is control to $Q_i$ and/or $Q_k$ & is nearest-neighbor to both.     $\\pm$ 25 MHz\n\n7     $f_{j,02} = f_{k,01} + f_{i,01}$     $Q_j$ is control to $Q_i$ and/or $Q_k$ & is nearest-neighbor to both.     $\\pm$ 17 MHz\n\nSeven most likely types of `frequency collision'. For bus-coupled transmon qubits employing cross-resonance gates and having anharmonicity $\\sim - 330$ MHz. Relative qubit positions illustrated in inset of <ref>. Bounds for types 1,2,3 are estimated from model results [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] as the region where gate errors due to `frequency collision' exceed $\\sim$ 1\n\nAround each of the `frequency collisions' described in  <ref>, we can designate a window of undesired frequencies. This breaks the frequency space into allowed and forbidden regions. Type 4 listed in <ref> defines forbidden zones where $ZX$ coupling is too low. For the other six conditions, we forbid regions where the `frequency collision' is the dominant source of gate error. Existing multi-qubit systems with CR gates typically exhibit two-qubit gate errors of 1 to 2\n\nA useful lattice of qubits should enable high quantum volume and fault-tolerant operation while avoiding all of the `frequency collisions' and forbidden regions presented in <ref>. Both lattice layout and the pattern of qubit frequencies are relevant. We consider three types of lattices: square, `heavy-square' and `heavy-hexagon' (<ref>). Lattices comprise qubits and two-qubit connections, each qubit being linked to no more than four neighbors. In many practical implementations, these links comprise microwave-resonant buses. A square lattice facilitates `surface code' fault-tolerant codes [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Recent literature describes hybrids of the surface code with Bacon-Shor type codes, which can be employed in `heavy hexagon' and `heavy square' lattices to achieve fault-tolerance, albeit with lower error thresholds than the surface code [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In addition to the data and ancilla qubit roles employed in the surface code, these hybrid codes assign a portion of the lattice as `flag' qubits.\n\nIn the square lattice, every qubit in the bulk of the lattice lies on a degree-four vertex, while some at edges have degree two or degree three. If we populate the square lattice with 5 distinct frequencies of qubits, $f_5 > f_4 > f_3 > f_2 > f_1$, with appropriate spacing between the frequencies, we can avoid all the forbidden regions of  <ref> [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In <ref>, we illustrate this pattern for square lattices capable of distance-5 ($d = 5$) rotated surface codes. Condition 4 of <ref> requires $f_{control} > f_{target}$, so the pattern also fixes the direction of CNOT gate for each pair.\n\nIn contrast to the square lattice, the `heavy square' lattice includes both degree-two and degree-four vertices in the bulk. Degree-one, -two or -three vertices appear at the edges. We take advantage of this pattern to make all the degree-two vertices control qubits, using a three-frequency pattern $f_3 > f_2 > f_1$. Since every control qubit (frequency $f_3$) is linked to at most two target qubits, we need only two properly-chosen target-qubit frequencies ($f_1$ and $f_2$) to satisfy conditions 5, 6 and 7 of <ref>, as shown in <ref>. A third type of lattice, the `heavy hexagon', uses a similar scheme. Here the bulk of the lattice includes degree-three and degree-two vertices. Additional degree-two and degree-one vertices lie at the edges. In this lattice, all of the `frequency collisions' and forbidden regions can be satisfied using only three frequencies $f_3 > f_2 > f_1$, with all control qubits residing on degree-two vertices with frequency $f_3$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nLattice and frequency-pattern examples. Lattices are capable of $d=5$ codes. Patterns of qubit frequencies avoid all conditions in <ref>. Statistical model is applied to these examples and to equivalent lattices at $d = 3$ and $d = 7$. (See Supplementary Figures 1-9.) Square lattice includes 49 qubits in 5-frequency pattern. Heavy-square lattice includes 73 qubits in 3-frequency pattern. Heavy-hexagon lattice includes 65 qubits in 3-frequency pattern. In a portion of the heavy-hexagon lattice, we indicate qubits' intended gate roles: control (black circles) or target (white circles); as well as code roles: data (D), ancilla (A) or flag (F) [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Inset shows relative positions of qubits for collision definitions of <ref>. $Q_j$ is coupled to nearest-neighbors $Q_i$ and to $Q_k$. Qubits $Q_i$ and $Q_k$ are next-nearest-neighbors.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nFrequency-crowding trends as a function of $\\sigma_f$. Results of Monte Carlo simulation. (See <ref>.) (a) Average number of collisions. and (b) Fraction of cases having zero `frequency collisions'. Simulation was applied to the lattices and frequency patterns shown in <ref>, capable of distance-5 codes, as well as to $d = 3$ and $d = 7$ scale lattices of square, heavy-square or heavy-hexagon type. (See Supplementary Figures 1-9 for lattice layouts and <ref> for numbers of qubits.) Color-coded dotted lines in part (b) are fits of each lattice yield to expression $\\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{(\\Delta f / \\sigma_f)} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} x^2} dx \\right]^N$, where $N$ is the number of qubits and $\\pm \\Delta f$ defines an allowable `window' around frequency set-points. (See <ref>.) Using this expression, two solid red lines predict yield for the heavy-hexagon lattice type at 300 and 1000 qubits, using $\\Delta f = $ 27.99 and 26.32 MHz, respectively. See <ref> for estimation of $\\Delta f$ as a function of qubit number.\n\nWe use a Monte Carlo model to quantify the frequency-crowding in each lattice type. We sample the qubits at random frequencies drawn from normal distributions characterized by $\\sigma_f$, and count the collisions defined in <ref>. (See <ref>.) In <ref>, we show the mean number of `frequency collisions' predicted by the Monte Carlo model for each lattice type and frequency pattern, as a function of $\\sigma_f$. As $\\sigma_f \\rightarrow 0$, the lattice approaches the ideal patterns of  <ref>, and has zero `frequency collisions'. As $\\sigma_f$ increases, the number of  `frequency collisions' rises steadily. As $\\sigma_f \\rightarrow f_{01} - f_{12}$, the different conditions appearing in <ref> all become likely, and a limiting number of `frequency collisions' is reached. Yield follows the inverse trend, as seen in <ref>. As $\\sigma_f$ increases, the likelihood of finding a `collision free' chip falls off sharply. While the step sizes between frequencies $f_1$ to $f_5$ are important, absolute frequency values are not. Setting $f_1= 5.0$, $f_2 = 5.07$ and $f_3 = 5.14$ GHz works as well as $f_1= 5.05$, $f_2 = 5.12$ and $f_3 = 5.19$ GHz.\n\nThe yield and mean collision number are a function of the several different collision types and bounds, so they are not readily susceptible to an analytic formulation. However, we can propose a simplified model for yield: in order for a lattice to be collision-free, every qubit in the lattice must fall within some frequency `window' $\\pm \\Delta f$ relative to its setpoint. Presuming the qubit frequencies are normally distributed, the probablity of this occurring goes as the cumulative distribution function, raised to the power $N$, where $N$ is the number of qubits: $\\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{(\\Delta f / \\sigma_f)} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} x^2} dx \\right]^N$. In the yield plot in <ref>, we fit this expression to find $\\Delta f$ for each lattice.\n\nThese model results allow us to predict how different lattice types and frequency patterns will respond to fabrication imprecision. As shown in <ref>, if imprecision $\\sigma_f$ is greater than 30 MHz, any $d = 5$ lattice will exhibit $>10$ `frequency collisions' of one or another of the types listed in <ref>, causing the affected gates to have error rates above $\\sim$ 1\n\nThe as-fabricated $\\sigma_f$ seen in <ref> is 132.3 MHz. (See <ref>) The Monte Carlo modeling finds that for a heavy-hexagon lattice at $d=3$ scale this $\\sigma_f$ can enable 0.1\n\nAs seen from the Monte Carlo analysis, the laser-anneal rework method can scale to the $>$ 100 qubit size, enabling a well-chosen lattice and frequency pattern to implement $d = 7$ error-correction codes free of frequency-crowding. To examine needs for the next generation of chips up to the 1000-qubit level, we can coarsely estimate requirements by extrapolating the fixed window model for the heavy-hexagon lattice as shown in <ref>. While the $\\sigma_f$ = 14.0 MHz demonstrated here enables practical yield up to the 100 to 200 qubit scale, it is clear that roughly a factor of two further improvement is needed to scale towards 1000 qubits. Since this precision is also better than the resistance-to-frequency prediction precision shown in this work, development of further refinements in tuning and frequency prediction approaches will be necessary as the scale of fixed-frequency transmon circuits surpass the 100 qubit milestone.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nYield scaling for heavy hexagon lattice.

{"prompt": "Explain the 'Summary and outlook' section of the paper.", "completion": "In this review, we have discussed the phenomenal progress over the last decade in the engineering of superconducting devices, the development of high-fidelity gate-operations, and quantum non-demolition measurements with high signal-to-noise ratio. Putting these advances together, we hope that it is clear that the planar superconducting qubit modality is a promising platform for realizing near-term medium scale quantum processors. While we have focused on highlighting the advances made within the fields of realizing, controlling and reading out planar superconducting qubits specifically used for quantum information processing, there has of course also been tremendous activity in the surrounding fields. In this final section, we briefly mention a few of those fields, and invite the reader to look into the references, for further details.\n\nQuantum annealing: Superconducting qubits also form the basis for certain quantum annealing platforms[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Quantum annealing operates by finding the ground state of a given Hamiltonian (typically a classical Ising Hamiltonian), and this state will correspond to the solution of an optimization problem. By utilizing a flux-qubit type design (see Sec.<ref>, the company D-Wave have demonstrated quantum annealing processors[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] which have now reached beyond 2000 qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The benchmarking of quantum annealers and attempts to demonstrate a quantum speedup for a general class of problems is a highly active research field, and we refer the reader, for example, to recent papers Refs. Denchev2016,Albash2018,King2019 and references therein.\n\nCavity based QIP: A parallel effort to the planar superconducting qubits discussed in this review is the development of 3D cavity-based superconducting qubits. In these systems, quantum information is encoded in superpositions of coherent photonic modes of the cavity[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The cat states can be highly coherent due to the inherently high quality factors associated with 3D cavities[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This approach has a fairly small hardware overhead to encode a logical qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and lends itself to certain implementations of asymmetric error-correcting codes due to the fact that errors due to single-photon loss in the cavity is a tractable observable to decode. Using this architecture, several important advances were recently demonstrated including extending the lifetime of an error-corrected qubit beyond its constituent parts[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], randomized benchmarking of logical operations[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], a  gate between two logical qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] as well as Ramsey interference of an encoded quantum error corrected qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nCryogenics and software development: We briefly mentioned the electrical engineering, software development, and cryogenic considerations associated with the control wiring and on-chip layout of medium-scale quantum processors. While dilution refrigerators are now readily available, off-the-shelf commercial products, the details of how to optimally do signal-routing and rapid data processing in a scalable fashion, is also a field in rapid development. However, with the recent demonstrations of enabling technologies such as 3D integration, packages for multi-layered devices and superconducting interconnects[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], some of the immediate concerns for how to scale the number of qubits in the superconducting modality, have been addressed. On the control software side, there currently exist multiple commercial and free software packages for interfacing with quantum hardware, such as [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the related [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, many laboratories use software platforms developed in-house, often due to the concurrent development of custom-built, highly specialized electronics and FPGA circuits (many of these developments are not always published, but readers may consult Refs. Asaad2016,LiuPhD2016,Ryan2017 for three examples). There is currently also a large ongoing development of quantum circuit simulation and compiling software packages. Packages such as [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ],  (with [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]), [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the Microsoft Quantum Development kit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] provide higher-level programming languages to compile and/or optimize quantum algorithms. For a recent review and comparison of these different software suites, we refer to Ref.LaRose2019 and Ref.Chong2017 for a general review on advances in designing quantum software. Since the connectivity and gate set of quantum processors can differ, details of the gate compilation implementation is an important non-trivial problem for larger-scale processors. We note that some of these software packages already interface directly with quantum processors that are available online, supplied, for example, via Rigetti Computing or the IBM Quantum Experience.\n\nQuantum error correction: While the qubit lifetimes and gate fidelity have improved dramatically in the last decades, there remains a need for error correction to reach large-scale processors. While certain strategies exist to extend the computational reach of current state-of-the-art physical qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], for truly large-scale algorithms addressing practical problems, the quantum data will have to be embedded in an error-correcting scheme. As briefly mentioned in Sections <ref> and <ref>, certain components of the surface code quantum error correcting scheme have already been demonstrated in superconducting qubits (see e.g. Refs.Kelly2015,Riste2015,Takita2016). However, the demonstration of a logical qubit with greater lifetime than the underlying physical qubits, remains an outstanding challenge. While the surface code is a promising quantum error correcting code due to its relatively lenient fault tolerance threshold, it cannot implement a universal gate set in a fault-tolerant manner. This means that the error-corrected gates in the surface code need to be supplemented, for example, with a  gate, to become universal. Such gates can be implemented by a technique known as magic state distillation[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The process of gate-teleportation, a pre-cursor to magic state distillation, has already been demonstrated using FPGA-based classical feedback with planar superconducting qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], but showing distillation and injection into a surface code logical state remains an open challenge. The development of new quantum codes is also a field in rapid development, and the reader may consult a recent review for more details e.g. Ref.Campbell2017. Another important step towards large-scale quantum processor architecture is that of remote entanglement, enabling quantum information to be distributed across different nodes of a quantum processing network[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nQuantum computational supremacy: Finally, we mention one of the grand challenges for superconducting qubits in the coming years: the demonstration of quantum computational supremacy[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The basic idea is to demonstrate a calculation, using qubits and algorithmic gates, which is outside the scope of classical computers (assuming some plausible computational complexity conjectures). For a recent review article, the reader is referred to Ref.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. A first step towards an approach to demonstrating quantum supremacy was recently reported, using 9 tunable transmons[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. It is expected that with somewhere between 50-100 qubits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], an extension of the protocol from Refs.Neill2018,Boixo2018, will allow researchers to sample from a classically intractable distribution, and thereby demonstrate quantum computational supremacy. The success of this program would constitute a phenomenal result for all of quantum computing.\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge Mollie Kimchi-Schwartz, Jochen Braum\u00fcller, Niels-Jakob S\u00f8e Loft, and David DiVincenzo for careful reading of the manuscript and Youngkyu Sung for use of his time-dependent qubit drive simulation suite and useful feedback from the entire Engineering Quantum Systems group at MIT.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Josephson Junctions' section of the paper.", "completion": "A crucial dielectric barrier in superconducting qubit circuits is the tunnel barrier oxide in the Josephson junction of the qubit itself. The vast majority of these Josephson junctions are made from Al$_2$O$_3$ grown at room temperature. This thin Al$_2$O$_3$ present in tunnel junctions is a source of TLS loss. Bulk loss of an amorphous Al$_2$O$_3$ junction has been measured to be on the order of $10^{-3}$ <cit.>. The fluxonium qubit, with its lower resonant frequency, can maintain long coherence times despite containing an array of large-area junctions with losses $\\sim 10^{-4}$ <cit.>. Crystalline Al$_2$O$_3$ barriers have shown promising losses around $6\\times10^{-5}$ <cit.>.\n\nOne current design philosophy is to statistically avoid strongly coupled TLS in Josephson junctions by minimizing the junction volume <cit.>. While current qubit designs have been engineered to avoid the loss from the tunnel barrier dielectric, lower loss tunnel barriers or interfaces could enable new, less constrained designs, and continued improvements in the tunnel barrier are a fruitful topic for ongoing research.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nSuperconducting microwave resonator measurements are an effective way to probe low power cryogenic losses in bulk and thin film dielectrics, interfaces between materials, and surface oxides. In this regime, TLS loss is often the dominant type of materials loss, and can be distinguished from other losses by its unique association with the capacitor and by its power and temperature dependence. Experiments probing the temperature, power, frequency, geometric and magnetic field dependence of loss can be used to determine the interplay between various loss mechanisms.\n\nIn order to perform accurate measurements, experiments must be carefully designed and executed. Common pitfalls producing inaccurate resonator measurement results include:\n\n* A lack of thermalization, which leads to artificially low reported intrinsic TLS loss;\n\n* The measurement of low power loss (in the place of TLS loss) when power-independent losses are large, which produces a seemingly high intrinsic TLS loss;\n\n* Measuring in reflection mode, which could report inaccurate $Q_i$ values due to impedance mismatches that cannot be corrected;\n\n* Measuring in transmission mode, which has the same drawback as above plus insufficient baseline information, making separating $Q_c$ and $Q_i$ impossible; and\n\n* Using a resonator design with a low filling factor for the material of interest, if other loss mechanisms are not negligible.\n\nMany different methods have been used to determine interface, thin film, and bulk dielectric loss at low powers and temperatures in superconducting quantum circuits. A review of the current body of work in this field lacks strong conclusions due to the many discrepancies in reporting of experimental parameters. The state-of-the-art in terms of planar superconducting geometries give losses in the low $10^{-6}$ range, which has been shown for several materials sets. Deposited dielectric performance is currently limited to $\\sim 10^{-5}$.\n\nPromising directions for future work can be divided into two subfields: loss metrology, and materials research.\n\nFruitful future projects in loss metrology include investigations into: thermalization of samples (including the impact of the sample box material and design, mounting method, and thermalization time); precise and unobtrusive calibration for millikelvin $S_{21}$ measurements; time fluctuations in $Q_i$ and $Q_c$ (including the effect of sampling rates and power regime); and resonator fitting (especially regime-dependent variations between DCM and INV models). Continuing to report noise values and further develop techniques for measuring noise could also be important for obtaining a complete picture of loss mechanisms in resonators.\n\nIn terms of materials research, we anticipate continued performance improvement in both dielectrics and superconducting metals. Towards reducing TLS loss, promising avenues include interface engineering and development of novel dielectrics.  Given the diversity of substrates, metals, and passivation layers currently employed, there exist materials or conditions that have yet to be explored to their full potential. Separately, planar resonators and 3D cavities alike will benefit from development of superconducting bonding. In the former case, high quality superconducting enclosures will be helpful to mitigate radiative loss and parasitic modes. In the case of 3D cavities, low-loss superconducting bonds enable scalable geometric constructions, including multilayer microwave integrated quantum circuits.\n\nThe authors advocate that future work in this area report TLS loss rather than low power loss, and publish base temperature, associated $Q_c$ values, and filling factors of the target materials for more accurate comparison between experiments and to avoid limiting the value of published results.\n\nIdeally, TLS loss would be extracted using both power- and temperature-dependent sweeps to demonstrate self-consistent results, although that is not always possible due to the additional complexity in experimental set-up. The inclusion of multiple or repeated resonator measurements, periodically in the same cooldown and over repeated cooldowns, as well as the use of a traceable resonator fit, would also strongly increase experimental reliability. Finally, the simultaneous measurement of multiple resonator parameters such as loss, frequency shift, and noise can yield a more comprehensive picture of TLS behavior, as well as reveal non-TLS loss mechanisms that may be present.\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY\n\nData sharing is not applicable to this article as no new data were created or analyzed in this study.\n\nThe authors would like to thank David Fork for his guidance, as well as Eric Rosenthal, Johannes Hubmayr, Katarina Cicak, Sisira Kanhirathingal, Daniel Sank, and Bob Buckley for their expertise and assistance with the writing process.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Implementing CZ Gate with Dynamically Decoupled Regime' section of the paper.", "completion": "With the tunability of the coupling, we now move to the implementation of two-qubit entangling gates. The iswap and $\\rm \\sqrt{iswap}$ gates are quite natural based on the Hamiltonian of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>)\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Their measured $\\chi_{\\mathrm{exp}}$ from quantum-process tomography (QPT), which can give full information about the gate process\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], are presented in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Fig3) with a gate fidelity of 96.8\n\nThe fully controllable interaction of the coupler allows for turning the coupler `on' or `off' as wished. The ideal scheme of implementing a CZ gate with a coupler is to have both qubits initialized in the operating point where $\\ket{11}$ and $\\ket{20}$ have the same energy with the coupling `off', and then slowly turn on the coupler for proper time to implement the gate. This method can avoid adjusting the qubit frequency, and thus reduce the leakage error. However, the unwanted crosstalk of the XY control lines in our device could degrade single-qubit gate performance because of the zero detuning between $\\omega_{12}$ of $Q_1$ and $\\omega_{01}$ of $Q_2$. Therefore, the qubits are initially detuned and at their sweet spots with the coupling `off'.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Schematic to realize the CZ gate using the usual $\\ket{11}$ and $\\ket{20}$ resonance. (b) Flux sequence to realize the CZ gate with DDR. The $Q_1$ frequency is unchanged during the process. A gradual flux pulse (for a cosine-type frequency adjustment) on $Q_2$ is to tune its frequency to the operating point, while a flux pulse on the coupler with an appropriate pulse shape to dynamically keep the coupling `off' (the shaded regions). The coupling is then turned on by applying another gradual flux pulse on the coupler (for a cosine-type coupler frequency adjustment) for proper two-qubit interaction time to acquire the required $\\pi$-phase shift on $\\ket{11}$. (c), (d) Confirmation of the `off' state of the coupling in the DDR and the corresponding measurement sequences. Top: the population of $\\ket{11}$ state shows purely exponential decay without any oscillation. Middle: phase accumulation of $\\ket{01}$ with respect to $\\ket{00}$. Bottom: phase accumulation of $\\ket{11}$ with respect to $\\ket{10}$. The difference between the lower two panels shows zero phase accumulation of $\\ket{11}$, confirming zero coupling. (e) Population of $\\ket{11}$ in three different schemes to realize the CZ gate. Upper: rectangular pulses to have a positive coupling strength. $t_R=222$\u00a0ns is required for realizing the standard two-qubit CZ gate. Middle: rectangular pulses to have a negative coupling regime. Obvious high-frequency oscillations occur and indicate the leakage out of $\\ket{11}$. Lower: DDR pulses to have a large negative coupling but with a smooth oscillation. A CZ gate can be accomplished with a gate time $t_D$=119\u00a0ns. (f) Bar chart of the measured real part of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{exp}}$ from a QPT shows a gate fidelity of 98.3$\\pm0.6$\n\nThe simplest case is to use rectangular fluxes to simultaneously pulse the qubits to the avoided-crossing point and turn on the coupling. Both our measurement and simulation reveal that the leakage out of $\\ket{11}$ can be effectively suppressed in the positive coupling regime rather than the negative one. This is evidenced by the observation of high-frequency oscillations [the middle panel in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Fig4)(e)], which cause unwanted leakage error. However, due to the weak positive coupling strength, a relatively long gate time ($t_R=222$\u00a0ns) is required to accomplish the CZ gate. The average CZ gate fidelity is 95.5\n\nTo improve the gate fidelity, we use a `dynamically decoupled regime' (DDR) scheme to implement the CZ gate. Note that DDR defined here differs in explication from the term `dynamical decoupling' used in coherent control pulse methods to suppress the dephasing error\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This scheme can not only efficiently suppress the leakage out of the computational subspace but also allow us to perform the gate in the negative coupling regime with larger interaction strength for a shorter gate time. The DDR scheme can be understood by mapping the interaction between the states $\\ket{11}$ and $\\ket{20}$ onto a Hamiltonian of a qubit $H=H_x\\sigma_x'+H_z\\sigma_z'$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where $H_x$ is the coupling energy between the states $\\ket{11}$ and $\\ket{20}$, $H_z$ is the frequency detuning of $\\ket{11}$ from the resonance point of the avoided crossing, and $\\sigma_x'$ and $\\sigma_z'$ are the corresponding Pauli operators which are distinguished from those on the computational qubit. For the typical direct coupling scheme without a coupler where the coupling energy $\\sigma_x'$ term is fixed, CZ gate is realized by adjusting only the $\\sigma_z'$ term, such as the one implemented with a rectangular pulse, fast adiabatic pulse or nonadiabatic pulse\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. While for the DDR scheme with a coupler, both $\\sigma_x'$ term and $\\sigma_z'$ term can be varied as wished.\n\nThe experimental flux sequence is shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Fig4)(b). We use a gradual flux pulse on $Q_2$ to tune its frequency to the operating point, while dynamically keeping the coupling `off'. This DDR is achieved by applying a flux pulse on the coupler with an appropriate pulse shape calculated by Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) and is further optimized to assure the zero coupling during the whole qubit frequency-changing process [the shaded regions where $Hx=0, Hz=Hz(t)$]. After that, we slowly turn on the coupling by applying another gradual flux pulse on the coupler and wait for proper time for the two-qubit interaction to acquire the $\\pi$-phase shift on $\\ket{11}$ [$Hx=Hx(t), Hz=0$]. The `off' state of the coupling in the DDR is confirmed by measuring the population change and phase accumulation of $\\ket{11}$ state with the same flux pulses as in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Fig4)(b) (the DDR and the dashed line in the middle). The experimental results and sequences are shown in Figs.\u00a0(Figure fig:Fig4)(c) and (Figure fig:Fig4)(d), respectively.\n\nWe choose an appropriate negative coupling strength to perform the CZ gate, balancing the gate time and qubit-coupler leakage induced by the non-negligible excitation of the coupler. The larger interaction strength reduces the CZ gate time to $t_D=119$\u00a0ns [bottom panel in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Fig4)(e)] and the gate fidelity is improved with an average QPT fidelity of 98.3$\\pm0.6$"}
{"prompt": "Explain the 'Compatibility with logical qubit operations' section of the paper.", "completion": "Two types of logical qubits can be envisioned for surface code: defect-based\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and planar\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Defect-based logical qubits are introduced by stopping the measurement of one or two stabilizers ($X$-type for rough logical qubits, and $Z$-type for smooth ones\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]). In our scheme, turning stabilizer measurements fully off can be accomplished in either of two ways. One is to mask off the $H$ gates of the corresponding ancilla using the VSM, without changing the detuning sequence or stopping the ancilla measurement. If the ancilla is in $\\ket{0}$, all its $\\CZf$ gates are inactive and there is no net action on the logical qubit. If it starts in $\\ket{1}$, the stabilizer operator (not its measurement) is applied. This performs a logical $\\XL$ $(\\ZL)$ gate on a rough (smooth) qubit. The ancilla measurements provide the key input allowing the decoder to keep track of the action by PFU. A second way to turn a stabilizer fully off is to mask off all the flux-pulse primitives in the interaction step.\n\nLogical operations, such as move and braiding operations on defect-based qubits\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and lattice surgery on planar ones\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], also require dynamically changing the weight of specific stabilizer measurements, i.e., selectively removing specific data qubits from the quantum parity checks. In our scheme, this can easily be achieved by selective on/off masking of flux-pulse primitives. For example, removing a qubit of type $\\Dtwo$ from the $X$-type stabilizer measurement below it simply requires masking off the pulse primitive at step 1. The order of the two-qubit gates can also be changed by masking."}
{"prompt": "Explain the '## Data processing on quantum computers' section of the paper.", "completion": "There have been a number of important algorithmic developments and demonstrations related to data processing on quantum computers and quantum machine learning (QML). One canonical QML algorithm is the Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for sampling solutions to systems of linear equations [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This algorithm can in certain settings provide exponential speedup over its classical counterparts; a four-qubit implementation was demonstrated by Zheng et al. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, the HHL algorithm is not NISQ-optimized and makes rather stringent demands on the system's ability to store and manipulate coherent quantum information.\n\nOne of the most promising QML algorithms for the NISQ era is the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The QAOA provides an approximate solution to an NP-hard multivariate minimization problem in polynomial time, with a guaranteed accuracy set by the algorithm.  Like the VQE, the QAOA allows for the bulk of calculations to be performed in the classical processor, with the quantum device only required to produce a certain quantum state and perform a set of quantum measurements. The QAOA was first demonstrated by Otterbach et al. using a 19-qubit processor [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nA third set of machine-learning NISQ algorithms relate to data classification.  These algorithms, which represent quantum equivalents of neural networks [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], take advantage of variational techniques to enable both supervised and unsupervised data classification mechanisms. In particular, Havlicek et al. demonstrated two supervised learning algorithms using two qubits on a five-qubit processor and laid out the case for the potential existence of feature maps for which a provable quantum advantage could be demonstrated [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. On a similar five-qubit processor, Rist\u00e9 et al. implemented the so-called `learning parity with noise' problem, which exhibits a quantum advantage [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nHowever, the assumption of access to some form of quantum random access memory (QRAM) [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] in several of the proposed schemes for analyzing classical data on quantum computers poses an open question for the feasibility of these protocols (see e.g. Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and references therein for details).[]\nQRAMA quantum form of random access memory which can store either quantum or classical data, but has the ability that stored data can be addressed using a superposition input.\nRAQMA random access quantum memory, where classical bits give the address of a quantum state to be retreived.\nUsing a single parametrically driven transmon qubit, a form of random access quantum memory (RAQM) was demonstrated by Naik et al.

{"prompt": "Explain the 'CZ gate characterization' section of the paper.", "completion": "To characterize the average gate fidelity, we employ randomized benchmarking where a sequence of random two-qubit Clifford gates is interleaved with CZ gates [Magesan, Easwar, Gambetta, Jay M., Johnson, B. R., Ryan, Colm A., Chow, Jerry M., Merkel, Seth T., da Silva, Marcus P., Keefe, George A., Rothwell, Mary B., Ohki, Thomas A., Ketchen, Mark B., Steffen, M., \"Efficient Measurement of Quantum Gate Error by Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking\", 2012] [Barends, Rami, Kelly, Julian, Megrant, Anthony, Veitia, Andrzej, Sank, Daniel, Jeffrey, Evan, White, Ted C, Mutus, Josh, Fowler, Austin G, Campbell, Brooks, others, \"Superconducting quantum circuits at the surface code threshold for fault tolerance\", 2014]. The experiment was repeated 14 times over a period of 15, shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:fig_3)(a). We extract an average error per CZ gate of $\\epsilon^{\\rm avg}_{\\rm CZ} = \\num[separate-uncertainty]{1.9(2)e-3}$ from the collected data, where the uncertainty indicates the 68 confidence interval. For consistency, the average error per Clifford $\\epsilon_{\\rm Clifford} = \\num[separate-uncertainty]{1.39(3)e-2}$ can be compared to the errors of its constituent CZ and single-qubit gates. On average, each  two-qubit Clifford gate consists of 1.5 CZ gates and 8.25 single-qubit gates [Barends, Rami, Kelly, Julian, Megrant, Anthony, Veitia, Andrzej, Sank, Daniel, Jeffrey, Evan, White, Ted C, Mutus, Josh, Fowler, Austin G, Campbell, Brooks, others, \"Superconducting quantum circuits at the surface code threshold for fault tolerance\", 2014], which by simple summation of errors results in the estimate for the Clifford error $\\epsilon_{\\rm Clifford}^{\\rm estimate} = \\num[separate-uncertainty]{1.1(4)e-2}$, in agreement with the measured value.\n\nWe can improve the estimate for the CZ gate error by interleaving multiple CZ gates in the randomized benchmarking sequence and calculating the average error per gate for different numbers $n$ of interleaved gates [Sheldon, Sarah, Bishop, Lev S, Magesan, Easwar, Filipp, Stefan, Chow, Jerry M, Gambetta, Jay M, \"Characterizing errors on qubit operations via iterative randomized benchmarking\", 2016]. As shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:fig_3)(b), the error per CZ gate converges from $\\epsilon_{\\rm CZ}^{(1)} = \\num[separate-uncertainty]{2.0(5)e-3}$ for one interleaved CZ gate towards $\\epsilon_{\\rm CZ}^{(20)} = \\num[separate-uncertainty]{2.35(7)e-3}$ for 20 interleaved CZ gates, demonstrating a seven-fold reduction in the uncertainty and a minor increase for the error per CZ gate, see Appendix\u00a0<ref> for further details. In contrast to conventional randomized benchmarking, where coherent errors are suppressed due to randomization of the basis between each application of the CZ gate, interleaving the sequence with several CZ gates reveals coherent errors as well since they tend to add up for the $n$ interleaved CZ gates. The minor increase in the error rate when interleaving multiple CZ gates suggests that the CZ gate fidelity is mostly limited by decoherence at its chosen operation point, rather than by coherent errors. The low error rate per CZ gate in the iterated randomized benchmarking experiment is important for real-world applications due to the accumulation of coherent errors being particularly detrimental to many quantum algorithms [Kjaergaard, M., Schwartz, M. E., Greene, A., Samach, G. O., Bengtsson, A., O'Keeffe, M., McNally, C. M., Braum\u00fcller, J., Kim, D. K., Krantz, P., Marvian, M., Melville, A., Niedzielski, B. M., Sung, Y., Winik, R., Yoder, J., Rosenberg, D., Obenland, K., Lloyd, S., Orlando, T. P., Marvian, I., Gustavsson, S., Oliver, W. D., \"Demonstration of Density Matrix Exponentiation Using a Superconducting Quantum Processor\", 2022].\n\nDuring the CZ gate, the coupler and the qubits become strongly hybridized which affects the coherence of the computational states. To quantify the impact of decoherence during the CZ gate, we first measure the energy relaxation times of all the three hybridized qubit and coupler modes as a function of the uncoupled coupler frequency, shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:fig_4)(a).\nEven though there are no individual drive and readout lines for the coupler, we can  measure the energy-relaxation time of the coupler-like mode using the qubit readout and drive lines when the coupler and qubit states are hybridized. For the coupler frequencies below 3.9 the degree of hybridization is low and we employ two-probe readout with $\\rm{Q}_2$ as an ancilla qubit instead, see Appendix\u00a0<ref> for details on the experiment. The measured frequencies of the hybridized modes are shown in Fig. (Figure fig:fig_4)(b). In the frequency range relevant for the CZ gate (gray shaded area), we observe that the energy-relaxation times of the qubit-like modes are not significantly affected by the hybridization with the coupler due to its high intrinsic energy-relaxation time, $T_1^{\\rm c} > \\SI{40}{\\micro\\second}$ at the idling configuration.\n\nTo model the dependency of the energy relaxation times of the hybridized states on the coupler frequency, we assume that the energy relaxation times of the uncoupled modes stay constant as a function of the coupler frequency. We then numerically evaluate the energy relaxation time of the coupled modes based solely on the degree of hybridization with the coupler, shown with solid lines in Fig\u00a0(Figure fig:fig_4)(a). In the frequency range relevant for the CZ gate and at coupler frequencies above 4.1, we find a good match between the measurements and the model. For coupler frequencies between 3.9 and 4.1, we observe unexpected dips in the relaxation times, which can potentially be attributed to parasitic two-level systems (TLSs) near ${\\rm Q_1}$ and ${\\rm Q_2}$ [Klimov, P. V., Kelly, J., Chen, Z., Neeley, M., Megrant, A., Burkett, B., Barends, R., Arya, K., Chiaro, B., Chen, Yu, Dunsworth, A., Fowler, A., Foxen, B., Gidney, C., Giustina, M., Graff, R., Huang, T., Jeffrey, E., Lucero, Erik, Mutus, J. Y., Naaman, O., Neill, C., Quintana, C., Roushan, P., Sank, Daniel, Vainsencher, A., Wenner, J., White, T. C., Boixo, S., Babbush, R., Smelyanskiy, V. N., Neven, H., Martinis, John M., \"Fluctuations of Energy-Relaxation Times in Superconducting Qubits\", 2018] [Clemens M\u00fcller, Jared H Cole, J\u00fcrgen Lisenfeld, \"Towards understanding two-level-systems in amorphous solids: insights from quantum circuits\", 2019] [Krinner, Sebastian, Lacroix, Nathan, Remm, Ants, Di Paolo, Agustin, Genois, Elie, Leroux, Catherine, Hellings, Christoph, Lazar, Stefania, Swiadek, Francois, Herrmann, Johannes, Norris, Graham J., Andersen, Christian Kraglund, M\u00fcller, Markus, Blais, Alexandre, Eichler, Christopher, Wallraff, Andreas, \"Realizing repeated quantum error correction in a distance-three surface code\", 2022]. However, these TLSs do not have a significant impact on the performance of the gate as long as the coupler remains below 3.9.\n\nNext, we measure the dephasing times of the three hybridized modes as a function of the coupler frequency, see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:fig_4)(c). At each of the frequencies, we perform a Ramsey experiment and extract the dephasing times from a fit to the model\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:decay_envelope}\n\\nu(t) = a(t)\\mathrm{e}^{-\\frac{t}{2 T_1} -\\frac{t}{T_{\\phi, 1}} -\\left(\\frac{t}{T_{\\phi, 2}}\\right)^2},\n\n$$\nwhere $a(t)$ is the response of the Ramsey experiment excluding decoherence, $T_1$ is the energy-relaxation time measured earlier, and $T_{\\phi, 1}$ and $T_{\\phi, 2}$ are the exponential and Gaussian components of the dephasing time. The exponential dephasing time originates from excess wide-band noise such as thermal excitations in the readout resonators [Yan, Fei, Campbell, Dan, Krantz, Philip, Kjaergaard, Morten, Kim, David, Yoder, Jonilyn L., Hover, David, Sears, Adam, Kerman, Andrew J., Orlando, Terry P., Gustavsson, Simon, Oliver, William D., \"Distinguishing Coherent and Thermal Photon Noise in a Circuit Quantum Electrodynamical System\", 2018] and is expected to only moderately contribute to the total dephasing. Indeed, we find $T_{\\phi, 1}^{\\rm Q1} \\approx \\SI{70}{\\micro\\second}$ and $T_{\\phi, 1}^{\\rm Q2} \\approx \\SI{45}{\\micro\\second}$ for the coupler frequencies relevant for the CZ gate, see Appendix\u00a0<ref> for the full data. The Gaussian component of the dephasing time is dominated by low-frequency flux noise [Bylander, Jonas, Gustavsson, Simon, Yan, Fei, Yoshihara, Fumiki, Harrabi, Khalil, Fitch, George, Cory, David G, Nakamura, Yasunobu, Tsai, Jaw-Shen, Oliver, William D, \"Noise spectroscopy through dynamical decoupling with a superconducting flux qubit\", 2011] (see Appendix\u00a0<ref> for details), which is a function of flux-dispersion of the uncoupled modes and the degree of their hybridisation. We model the dephasing rate of the coupled mode $k$ as\n$$\n\n\\Gamma_{\\phi, 2}^{k} = 1/T_{\\phi, 2}^{k} =\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=\\rm{Q_1}, \\rm{Q_2}, \\rm{c}} \\left(p_{i, k}\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{\\phi, 2}^i\\right)^2},\n\n$$\nwhere $p_{i, k}$ is the participation ratio of the uncoupled mode $i$ in the hybridized mode $k$ and $\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{\\phi, 2}^i$ are the dephasing rates of the uncoupled modes, see Fig. (Figure fig:fig_4)(c) for the comparison of the model and the experimental data. Above we have assumed that flux noise affecting the uncoupled modes originates from independent sources and can be approximated as quasi-static noise, resulting in the dephasing rates of the uncoupled modes to sum in square [Ithier, G., Collin, E., Joyez, P., Meeson, P. J., Vion, D., Esteve, D., Chiarello, F., Shnirman, A., Makhlin, Y., Schriefl, J., Sch\u00f6n, G., \"Decoherence in a superconducting quantum bit circuit\", 2005]. To account for the change in the flux noise sensitivity of the uncoupled coupler mode as its frequency is varied, we model the coupler dephasing rate as $\\tilde{\\Gamma}_{\\phi, 2}^{\\rm c} = B|\\frac{\\partial\\omega_{\\rm c}}{\\partial\\Phi_{\\rm c}}|$ [Bylander, Jonas, Gustavsson, Simon, Yan, Fei, Yoshihara, Fumiki, Harrabi, Khalil, Fitch, George, Cory, David G, Nakamura, Yasunobu, Tsai, Jaw-Shen, Oliver, William D, \"Noise spectroscopy through dynamical decoupling with a superconducting flux qubit\", 2011], where $\\omega_{\\rm c}/2\\pi$ is the frequency of the uncoupled coupler mode, $\\Phi_{\\rm c}$ is the coupler flux, $B\\approx\\SI{53}{\\Phi_0}$ is the flux noise amplitude extracted from a fit to the coupler dephasing rate when it is decoupled from the qubits, and $\\Phi_0$ is the flux quantum. With these assumptions, we observe an excellent match between the experimental data and the model across the measured coupler frequency range, and note that the dephasing times of the qubit modes stay above $\\SI{1}{\\micro\\second}$ even when maximally hybridized with the coupler due to having the coupler flux sweet spot being located near the qubit frequencies.\n\nIn order to estimate the coherence limit of an arbitrarily long CZ gate, we calculate effective relaxation times $T_{1, {\\rm eff}}$ and effective dephasing times $T_{\\phi, 1, {\\rm eff}}$ and $T_{\\phi, 2, {\\rm eff}}$ for both qubits by weighting the measured coherence rates with the time spend on the corresponding continuous adiabatic trajectories [Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:fig_4)(b)] during the CZ gate, see Appendix\u00a0<ref> for additional information. The time spent on each frequency is determined by the Slepian pulse shape, which we parameterize with the interaction time $\\tau$. For each $\\tau$, we re-calculate the pulse shape using the $ZZ$ interaction strength calibration data in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:fig_2)(b) to ensure that a conditional phase of $\\phi_{11}=\\pi$ is accumulated.\n\nThe coherence limit can then be calculated as [Chu, Ji, Yan, Fei, \"Coupler-Assisted Controlled-Phase Gate with Enhanced Adiabaticity\", 2021] [Abad, Tahereh, Fern\u00e1ndez-Pend\u00e1s, Jorge, Kockum, Anton Frisk, Johansson, G\u00f6ran, \"Universal fidelity reduction of quantum operations from weak dissipation\", 2021]\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:coherence_limit}\n\\epsilon_{\\rm CZ}^{\\rm limit}(\\tau) = \\sum_{i=1,2} \\frac{2}{5}\\left[ \\frac{\\tau}{T_{1, {\\rm eff}}^{{\\rm Q}_i} (\\tau)} +\n\\frac{\\tau}{T_{\\phi, 1, {\\rm eff}}^{{\\rm Q}_i} (\\tau)} +\n\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{T_{\\phi, 2, {\\rm eff}}^{{\\rm Q}_i}(\\tau)}\\right)^2 \\right],\n\n$$\nwhere the first term in the square brackets corresponds to the coherence limit of the CZ gate due to the relaxation times of qubits and the second and third terms yield the coherence limits due to exponential and Gaussian components of dephasing, respectively. Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:fig_4)(d) depicts the coherence limit for the gate error $\\epsilon_{\\rm CZ}^{\\rm limit}$ for various different gate durations along with the contributions of the individual terms in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).\n\nFor our CZ gate with the interaction time of 22 and an additional 11 wait time around it, we obtain $T_{1, {\\rm eff}}^{{\\rm Q}_1} = \\SI{14}{\\micro\\second}$, $T_{1, {\\rm eff}}^{{\\rm Q}_2} = \\SI{43}{\\micro\\second}$, $T_{\\phi, 1, {\\rm eff}}^{{\\rm Q}_1} = \\SI{67}{\\micro\\second}$, $T_{\\phi, 1, {\\rm eff}}^{{\\rm Q}_2} = \\SI{43}{\\micro\\second}$, $T_{\\phi, 2, {\\rm eff}}^{{\\rm Q}_1} = \\SI{17}{\\micro\\second}$ and $T_{\\phi, 2, {\\rm eff}}^{{\\rm Q}_2} = \\SI{6}{\\micro\\second}$, yielding a coherence limit of $\\epsilon_{\\rm CZ}^{\\rm limit} = \\num{1.7e-3}$. This limit can be compared with the experimentally measured gate error $\\epsilon_{\\rm CZ} = \\num[separate-uncertainty]{1.9(2)e-3}$ which is only slightly higher, indicating that the gate is mostly coherence limited, as was already suggested by the randomized benchmarking experiment with multiple interleaved CZ gates. The most significant contribution to the errors comes from the energy relaxation time $T_{1, {\\rm eff}}^{{\\rm Q}_1}$. Importantly, the fidelity is only modestly affected by dephasing, mainly due to the possibility to operate the coupler near its flux insensitive sweep spot during the CZ gate. To demonstrate that the coupler coherence times at the two-qubit-gate operation region are high enough not to have a detrimental impact on the gate errors, we re-compute the coherence limit assuming that hybridization with the coupler does not affect the qubit coherence times and use this as a reference, see Fig. (Figure fig:fig_4)(d). Comparing the reference case with the coherence limit $\\epsilon_{\\rm CZ}^{\\rm limit}$, we find a negligible difference, confirming the hypothesis.\n\nPossible reasons for the remaining errors include system fluctuations due to TLSs nearby the qubits, leading to rare uncontrollable jumps in the qubit frequencies, as well as uncompensated flux pulse distortions in the nanosecond range and leakage to non-computational states."}

{"prompt": "What methodology was used in the paper 'A practical guide for building superconducting quantum devices'?", "completion": "Spectroscopy generally refers to the measurement of intensity as a function of frequency and is commonly used in cQED experiments to determine resonance frequencies of resonators and qubits.\n\nIdentifying the frequency of the readout resonator is usually the first step in characterizing a device. This is typically done using single-tone spectroscopy, in either the transmission, reflection, or `hanger' configuration in which one or multiple resonators are coupled to a common feedline (see\u00a0<ref>). These techniques have their respective appeals and limitations. A thorough analysis of these different resonator measurement schemes can be found in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nGenerally, transmission measurements are simple to set up and allow us to extract the amplitude and phase information of the signal as it passes through the resonator. Reflection measurements offer similar capabilities but with the added advantage of allowing a direct extraction of the internal quality factor. However, it requires a circulator in order to appropriately direct the input and output signals. This can potentially introduce additional losses in the measurement. The hanger configuration employs an unbalanced tee\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] in contrast to the circulator used in the reflection circuit. In this case, part of the input signal interacts with the resonator and upon its return, interferes with the other half that is directly transmitted through the tee. One important advantage of the hanger circuit is that it allows for many elements to be multiplexed using the same feedline. It has become a widely adopted technique in the multiplexed measurement of planar resonators.\n\nAs an example, let us consider the case of several $\\lambda/4$ CPW resonators capacitively coupled to a common microwave feedline. The measured S21 of each resonator in response to a drive at $\\omega=2\\pi f$ is described by a Lorentzian line shape, which can be written as\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]:\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:resonator_S21}\nS_{21} = A \\left[1+\\alpha\\frac{\\omega-\\omega_r}{\\omega_r}\\right]\\left[1 - \\frac{\\frac{|\\kappa_c|}{\\kappa}}{1+2i \\frac{\\omega-\\omega_r}{\\kappa}}\\right] e^{i(\\tau_v \\omega + \\phi_0)},\n\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the transmission amplitude away from resonance and $\\omega_r$ is the qubit-state dependent resonance frequency of the readout mode.\nThe parameter $\\alpha$ allows for a linear variation in the overall transmission chain in the frequency range around the resonator and $\\tau_v$ and $\\phi_0$ relate to propagation delays to and from the sample.\n\nThe frequency independent coupling rate $\\kappa_c$ denotes the strength with which the field of the resonator couples to the transmission line and is set by the system design, as discussed in Sec.\u00a0<ref>. On the other hand, $\\kappa_i$ is indicates the internal coherence properties of the resonator, and it is determined by the material quality and device layout, as discussed in Sec.\u00a0<ref>. Finally, $\\kappa$ contains contributions from both $\\kappa_i$ and $\\kappa_c$, i.e.\u00a0$\\kappa = \\kappa_c + \\kappa_i$. Fitting the measured S21 data to Eq.\u00a0<ref> returns the key parameters $\\omega_r, \\kappa$, and $\\kappa_c$, as described in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. We can also relate these coupling rates to the associated quality factors of the mode by $Q_{c, i} = \\omega_r/\\kappa_{c,i}$.\n\nRegardless of the exact measurement circuit, it is important to note that this spectroscopy experiment takes place before the optimization of the various pulses and amplification configurations. Thus, it can be challenging to obtain a clean signal at this stage. A useful technique to circumvent this issue is to perform a spectroscopy experiment in the high-power limit, where the resonator can be driven to a `bright' state regardless of the state of the qubit\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In this regime, the signal-to-noise ratio is boosted significantly as the high microwave power used in the probing tone dwarfs the noise in the system. This provides a convenient tool to quickly locate the bare resonance frequency of the readout mode $\\omega_R$ without tuning up the rest of the system.\n\nSubsequently, we can determine the `dressed' frequency of the resonator $\\tilde\\omega_R$ by repeating the spectroscopy experiment at different powers. This power sweep also provides a convenient test of whether the resonator is coupled to a qubit mode. If a qubit is dispersively coupled to the resonator, the resonance frequency will be different in the low-power (one or few photons) and high-power (hundreds of photons or more) regimes. In the transmission circuit, a typical power-vs-frequency sweep reveals a sharp resonance at the bare cavity frequency, which then undergoes a clear shift as the power is progressively reduced to the few photon limit, as shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cavspec)(a).\nThis power-dependent dispersive shift is the the Lamb-shift $\\Lambda_\\chi=g^2/\\Delta$ [<ref>].\nThe profile of the resonance at this power becomes a well-defined Lorentzian with a sufficiently narrow line-width compared to the magnitude of the dispersive coupling (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cavspec)(b)). Furthermore, based on this power sweep, we can now choose an appropriate readout power for the subsequent characterization experiments. It should produce a sufficiently high signal without causing non-linear distortions or broadening of the resonator response. In the example shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cavspec)(a), we could choose $-20\\,$dBm and $-25\\,$dBm for a high-contrast readout. It is also worth pointing out that in this particular device, the transmon qubit has some residual thermal population, which gives rise to an additional feature (labeled point C in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cavspec)(a)) besides the main low-power transmission peak. This corresponds to resonator's frequency when the transmon is in its first excited state, with the magnitude of the shift given by the dispersive coupling strength, $\\chi=2E_C (\\tfrac{g}{\\Delta})^2$ as shown in Eq.\u00a0<ref>.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nResonator power scan. (a) Outcome cavity spectroscopy experiments repeated at different input powers. The three features of interest are indicated by the arrows, corresponding to the high-power tranmissoin peak (A), lower power transmission peaks with transmon in ground state (B) and residual excited state (C), respectively.  (b) A line cut at three different powers, highlighting the clear shift in resonance frequency of the resonator as it transitions from the high- to low-power regimes.\n\nNext, we can use this un-optimized readout to identify the frequency of the qubit in a separate spectroscopy experiment. For flux-tunable qubits, a useful technique prior to qubit spectroscopy is to first move the qubit to the flux-insensitive sweet spot. This can be done by performing a resonator spectroscopy in the low-power regime while changing the current applied to the flux-bias line $I_{\\mathrm{FBL}}$. If the qubit couples to this flux line, $\\omega_r$ will depend on the flux bias through the dispersive shift $\\chi$. The period of $\\omega_r$ as a function of $I_{\\mathrm{FBL}}$ corresponds directly to the current per flux quantum $I_{\\mathrm{FBL}}/\\Phi_0$ picked up by the SQUID loop. In the regime of $\\omega_q<\\omega_r$, the qubit is at the sweet-spot when $\\omega_r$ is at a maximum. This also provides an estimate of the dispersive shift and the rough frequency regime of the qubit. While these are rather crude estimates, it is nonetheless helpful to narrow down the possible range of the qubit frequency as it can sometimes be challenging to identify the qubit resonance, which is typically much narrower (higher-Q) compared to the readout mode.\n\nThe technique for measuring the resonance frequency of the qubit is often referred to as a \u201ctwo-tone\" continuous-wave spectroscopy. In this protocol, a constant microwave tone is applied at $\\omega_r$ while a second drive ($\\omega_s$), with variable frequency, is employed to probe the state of the qubit. When this second tone comes close to the resonance of the qubit, i.e. $\\omega_s\\approx \\omega_q$, the frequency of the resonator changes due to the dispersive coupling. This shift leads to a change in the resonator's response to the constant drive tone at $\\omega_r$ and hence, provides an indication of the qubit state.\n\nWhile this is conceptually straightforward, it can sometimes be challenging to implement in practice. One of the difficulties relates to the power that is applied to the qubit via the spectroscopy tone. If the power is too low, the qubit will not get excited even if the drive frequency is close to its resonance and thus, no shift will be observed. On the other hand, if too much power is applied, the line width of the resonance will increase due to power broadening\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], eventually resulting in the peak becoming so wide that it can no longer be distinguished from the background. It can be hard to estimate what the \u201cright\u201d amount of power is for spectroscopy because this depends on how strongly the qubit couples to the drive line, something that is unknown before characterizing the device. An operational approach to this problem is to simply repeat the spectroscopy experiment for different powers until the resonance is found.\n\nFollowing this, we can confirm that it is indeed the qubit mode of interest by verifying the flux-dependence of its resonance frequency. Furthermore, in order to obtain a slightly more precise reading of the qubit frequency, we often employ another form of two-tone spectroscopy where both drives are pulsed, rather than continuous. Typically, a (square) pulse is first applied at $\\omega_s$, in the vicinity of the previously found qubit frequency, followed by a second pulse at $\\omega_r$. The pulsed-spectroscopy experiment removes the AC Stark shift the qubit experiences due to the always-on readout tone\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Furthermore, the absence of these continuous drives also prevent spurious heating of the device due to dissipation of microwave power at 20 mK, where the cooling power of the dilution refrigerator is limited to several $\\mu$W.\n\nAfter identifying the qubit, the anharmonicity can be determined by a simple variant of a regular two-tone spectroscopy experiment with the introduction of a third drive. This three-tone spectroscopy allows us to have an additional probe that could induce the $\\ket{1}\\leftrightarrow{\\ket{2}}$ transition of the transmon at frequency $f_{12}$ while also performing operations on the readout resonator and the $\\ket{0}\\leftrightarrow{\\ket{1}}$ transition of the qubit.\n\nIn such an experiment, the first spectroscopy tone ($s1$) is varied in frequency $f_{s1}$ around the $\\ket{0}\\leftrightarrow{\\ket{1}}$ resonance of the transmon at frequency $f_{01}$. The frequency, $f_{s2}$, of the second spectroscopy tone ($s2$) is swept around the expected $\\ket{1}\\leftrightarrow{\\ket{2}}$ transition, which is typically $\\sim 200-300\\,$MHz below the $\\ket{0}\\leftrightarrow{\\ket{1}}$ resonance. The the $\\ket{0}\\leftrightarrow{\\ket{1}}$ transition manifests as a line at $f_{s1}=f_{01}$ while the $\\ket{2}$ state appears as a diagonal line corresponding to the condition $f_{s1}+f_{s2} = f_{01}+f_{12}$. The location of this second transition indicates the anharmonicity of the transmon, which can be an important consideration for the design and calibration of subsequent single-qubit operations."}

The best state discrimination is obtained by maximizing the separation between the two states in the $(I,Q)$-plane, i.e. the in-phase and quadrature component of the voltage, see Fig. <ref>(c). It can be shown that this separation is maximal when the resonator is probed just in-between the two qubit-state dependent resonance frequencies\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], $\\omega_{\\mbox{\\tiny{RF}}} = (\\omega_{r}^{|0\\rangle} + \\omega_{r}^{|1\\rangle})/2$. In this case, the reflected magnitude is identical for $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, and all information about the qubit state is encoded in the phase $\\theta$, see dashed line in Fig. <ref>(b). In turn, the qubit-resonator detuning should be designed to obey the criterion for maximal state visibility, $\\chi = \\kappa/2$, which is maximized for phase measurements while constraining qubit dephasing.\n\nOnce we have picked the resonator probe frequency, the quantum dynamics of the qubit can be mapped onto the phase of the classical microwave response. In the following, we discuss how we can use heterodyne detection to measure the phase of the resonator response. We assume that the reader is already somewhat familiar with basic mixer operations, such as modulation and de-modulation of signals. For interested readers, we refer to Ref.\u00a0Marki2010."}

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Gate operations in superconducting qubits' section of the paper.", "completion": "The predominant technique for implementing single-qubit operations is via microwave irradiation of the superconducting circuit. Electromagnetic coupling to the qubit with microwaves at the qubit transition frequency drives Rabi oscillations in the qubit state. Control of the phase and amplitude of the drive is then used to implement rotations about an arbitrary axis in the $x,y$ plane. Within the rotating wave approximation, a microwave drive resonant with the qubit frequency gives rise to the Hamiltonian $\\hat H_\\text{drive} = \\Omega \\left( I(t)\\hat\\sigma_x + Q(t)\\hat\\sigma_y\\right)$, where $I(t)$ ($Q(t)$) is the envelope function of the in-phase (quadrature) component of the microwave signal and $\\Omega$ is the Rabi frequency as experienced by the qubit. However, due to the typically low anharmonicity of the transmon qubit, higher-order levels are easily populated, leading to leakage and dephasing effects.[]\nI,Q$I(t)$ and $Q(t)$ are the in-phase and quadrature components of the amplitude of the microwave drive. The labels are borrowed from classical RF processing.\nTo counteract this, the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) technique is typically used to enable fast gates without leakage into higher-level states [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and single-qubit gates are now routinely implemented with fidelities $\\gtrsim0.99$\u00a0(e.g. Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]), typically measured using interleaved Clifford randomized benchmarking [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]). $z$-axis rotations are typically performed in a virtual manner, where the phase of the qubit drives are shifted, effectively producing a $z$-rotation [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nWhile the implementation of single-qubit gates is now mostly uniform across the community, many different two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, and several of those have reached fidelities $>0.99$. []\nInterleaved Clifford randomized benchmarkingA technique for assessing the average fidelity of a quantum gate, by interleaving the gate of interest in sequences of Clifford gates, and randomizing over many such sequences.\nThe two-qubit gates can be roughly split into three categories. One class uses tunable transmon qubits whose frequencies can be modulated by applying magnetic flux through a dc-SQUID loop that tunes the effective critical current of the Josephson junction. Several high-fidelity two-qubit gates can be implemented by tuning certain transitions close to resonance [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (see details in Tbl.\u00a0(Table tab:2qubitgates)). The second class uses fixed-frequency qubits which are manipulated by microwave irradiation, typically driving one qubit at the frequency of a second qubit, to enact high-fidelity entangling gates [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The third class relies on parametrically driving a coupling element (or the qubits themselves) to induce a tunable coupling between the qubits. Such operations are referred to as \"parametrically driven\", and two high-fidelity two-qubit gates have recently been demonstrated using such parametrically driven interactions [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Common to all these gates is that they generate entanglement in the system via conditional rotations or transitions, such that the state and/or the phase of one qubit becomes dependent on that of the other. The class that uses tunable qubits has increased sensitivity to flux noise, but gates can be implemented more quickly. Conversely, the fixed frequency devices typically have longer lifetimes, but also require longer gate operation times.

Building a universal fault-tolerant quantum computer requires the ability to perform a high-fidelity two quantum-bit (qubit) entangling gate and, while many proposals have been put forth for implementing two-qubit gates, few experimental demonstrations have achieved fidelities near those determined by fault-tolerant analyses\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The cross-resonance (CR) gate\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] has recently been utilized in superconducting circuit systems\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] to achieve a two-qubit CNOT gate with high fidelity exceeding 0.99\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and has been used in small-scale multi-qubit demonstrations of fault-tolerant protocols\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Here we provide a theoretical analysis of the CR gate and outline effective Hamiltonian methods that can be used to obtain a description of the gate dynamics. The techniques developed are directly applicable in realistic systems as shown by the improved experimental calibration and high two-qubit gate fidelity of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nBroadly speaking, the goal of effective Hamiltonian theory is to model some set of complex dynamics on a large system via a more compact Hamiltonian on a set of smaller subsystems or subspaces. Effective Hamiltonian methods have been utilized in various areas of physics and chemistry including nuclear, atomic-molecular, optical, and condensed matter systems. In particular, techniques for the adiabatic elimination of higher energy levels in a system have been widely studied, common examples including the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and Born-Oppenheimer approximation\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Here we restrict attention to effective Hamiltonian constructions based on unitary (canonical) operations that transform the Hamiltonian $H$ on the full Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ into a block-diagonal Hamiltonian $\\Heff$ with the two-block case corresponding to the standard Schrieffer-Wolff transformation.\n\nWe outline the perturbative construction of an effective Hamiltonian where the desired block-diagonal form is enforced at each order. The advantage of the perturbative construction lies in obtaining analytical expressions for components of $\\Heff$ that hold in the weak perturbation limit. The second construction is based on an exact multi-block-diagonalization technique\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] which finds the block-diagonal Hamiltonian that is closest to the true Hamiltonian under the principle of least action. This method has the advantage of being valid in the strong drive regime however it is not possible to compute general analytic expressions for the Hamiltonian components except in simple cases such as the basic two-qubit model. These methods are applied to obtain an effective model for the CR gate Hamiltonian in the two-qubit model as well as when higher levels are included. As a concrete example we use the parameters of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and find good agreement between the perturbative and exact multi-block diagonalization approaches in the weak-drive limit with higher levels included. However a discrepancy is found between the theory and experiment since Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] finds the presence of extra unwanted terms in the Hamiltonian. We propose classical cross-talk between the two transmons from the CR drive as a potential source for this discrepancy and extend the analysis to include this effect. After doing so we find very good agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental results of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. First in Sec.\u00a0<ref> we describe the starting Hamiltonian for the analysis which consists of two transmons dispersively coupled to a resonator. We outline a method to find an effective block-diagonal Hamiltonian for the two transmon-resonator system which when projected onto the zero-excitation subspace of the resonator provides an effective Hamiltonian for the two transmon system alone. Next in Sec.\u00a0<ref> we model the transmons as ideal qubits and find an analytic expression for the effective CR Hamiltonian under the principle of least action. In Sec.\u00a0<ref> we model the transmons as Duffing oscillators and find perturbative expressions that hold in the weak-drive limit. We also perform a numerical analysis of the exact block-diagonalization technique using the parameters of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In Sec.\u00a0<ref> we analyze classical cross-talk occurring from the CR drive to model the results of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For clarity of the presentation the mathematical methods and details of effective Hamiltonian theory are contained in the appendix (Sec.\u00a0<ref>) with the main text focused mainly on discussion of the application of the methods to the CR gate.\n\n## Initial Hamiltonian and effective two-transmon Hamiltonian\nWe start with a Hamiltonian describing the standard cQED\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] set-up of two transmons\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], modeled as Duffing oscillators, coupled to a bus resonator\n$$\n\nH_\\text{sys}=\\sum_{j=1}^2\\left(\\bar{\\omega}_jb_j^{\\dagger}b_j + \\frac{\\delta_1}{2}b_j^{\\dagger}b_j(b_j^{\\dagger}b_j-\\openone)\\right) + \\omega_r c^\\dagger c \\nonumber \\\\\n+ \\sum_{j=1}^2g_j(b_j^\\dagger c + b_jc^{\\dagger}),\n\n$$\nwhere we set $\\hbar = 1$. Here $\\bar{\\omega}_jb_j^{\\dagger}b_j + \\frac{\\delta_j}{2}b_j^{\\dagger}b_j(b_j^{\\dagger}b_j-\\openone)$ is the Duffing Hamiltonian of the $j$'th transmon ($j=1,2$) with $\\bar{\\omega}_j$ and $\\delta_j$ being the $01$ transition frequency and anharmonicity of the $j$'th transmon respectively. The resonator Hamiltonian $\\omega_r c^\\dagger c$ is a single-mode harmonic oscillator with fundamental frequency $\\omega_r \\gg \\bar{\\omega}_{1(2)}$. Each transmon is coupled to the resonator by a Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian with coupling strength $g_j$ and since we are in the dispersive regime,\n$$\n\n\\left|\\frac{g_j}{\\Delta_{j,r}}\\right| & \\ll 1,\n\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_{j,r} = \\bar{\\omega}_j - \\omega_r$ is the detuning of the $j$'th transmon to the resonator. Note the total number of excitations is a symmetry of the system as the total excitation operator commutes with $H_\\text{sys}$.\n\nLet us write $H_\\text{sys}$ as the sum of two Hamiltonians $H_{\\text{sys},0}$ and $H_{\\text{sys},1}$\n$$\n\nH_{\\text{sys},0} &= \\sum_{j=1}^2\\left(\\bar{\\omega}_jb_j^{\\dagger}b_j + \\frac{\\delta_1}{2}b_j^{\\dagger}b_j(b_j^{\\dagger}b_j-\\openone)\\right) + \\omega_r c^\\dagger c, \\nonumber \\\\\nH_{\\text{sys},1} &=  \\sum_{j=1}^2g_j(b_j^\\dagger c + b_jc^{\\dagger}),\n\n$$\nwhere $H_{\\text{sys},0}$ is diagonal and $H_{\\text{sys},1}$ contains all of the coupling terms so is off-diagonal. Moving into the frame rotating at $\\omega_r$ via the unitary\n$$\n\nR&= e^{-it\\omega_r\\left(b_1^\\dagger b_1 + b_2^\\dagger b_2 + c^\\dagger c\\right)},\n\n$$\ngives\n$$\n\nH_\\text{sys}&=\\sum_{j=1}^2\\left(\\Delta_{j,r} b_j^{\\dagger}b_j + \\frac{\\delta_j}{2}b_j^{\\dagger}b_j(b_j^{\\dagger}b_j-\\openone) \\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&+ \\sum_{j=1}^2g_j(b_j^\\dagger c + b_jc^{\\dagger}),\n\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_{j,r} = \\bar{\\omega}_j-\\omega_r$. In this frame the diagonal part of $H_\\text{sys}$ is independent of the resonator photon number. Therefore $H_\\text{sys}$ is the direct sum of infinitely many identical copies (blocks) where each copy corresponds to a photon number $\\{0,1,2,...\\}$,\n$$\n\n\\text{diag}(H_\\text{sys}) &=\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccccc}\n0_p\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\: \t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t1_p\t&\t \\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t 2_p\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t \\:\t&\t\\:.\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t \\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:.\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t \\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:.\t\\\\\n\\end{array} \\right].\n\n$$\nAll of the photon number blocks $j_p$ describe the same two-transmon Hamiltonian and each block can be broken into sub-blocks labeled by excitation number of the transmons\n$$\n\nj_p &=\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccccc}\n0\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\: \t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t\\{\\Delta_{i,r}\\}\t&\t \\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\{2\\Delta_{i,r}+\\delta_i, \\Delta_{1,r} + \\Delta_{2,r}\\}\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t \\:\t&\t\\:.\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t \\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:.\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t \\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:.\t\\\\\n\\end{array} \\right].\n\n$$\nHence we can denote every possible excitation block by the label $(j_P,k_T)$ where \u201cP\" refers to photon and \u201cT\" refers to transmon.\n\nNow, since the photon number blocks $j_p$ support the same Hamiltonian, the blocks $(m_P,k_T)$ and $(r_P,k_T)$ have the exact same form for $m \\neq r$ and we can group all of the levels with the same transmon excitation number into a single infinite-dimensional block. The first block corresponds to zero excitations in the transmons\n$$\n\n\\{(0_P,0_T), (1_P,0_T),....,(m_P,0_T),...\\} \\nonumber \\\\\n= \\{|0_P\\rangle \\otimes |00\\rangle, |1_P\\rangle \\otimes |00\\rangle,....,|m_P\\rangle \\otimes |00\\rangle,...\\},\n\n$$\nat 0 energy scale, the second block corresponds to one transmon excitation\n$$\n\n\\{(0_P,1_T),....,(m_P,1_T),...\\} \\nonumber \\\\\n=  \\{|0_P\\rangle \\otimes |01\\rangle, |0_P\\rangle \\otimes |10\\rangle,....,|m_P\\rangle \\otimes |01\\rangle,|m_P\\rangle \\otimes |10\\rangle,...\\},\n\n$$\nat the energy scale $\\{\\Delta_{1,r},\\Delta_{2,r}\\}$, and the third block corresponds to two transmon excitations\n$$\n\n& \\{(0_P,2_T),....,(m_P,2_T),...\\}\\nonumber \\\\\n&=  \\{|0_P\\rangle \\otimes |02\\rangle, |0_P\\rangle \\otimes |11\\rangle, |0_P\\rangle \\otimes |20\\rangle,....,\\nonumber \\\\\n& \\: \\: \\: \\: \\: \\: |m_P\\rangle \\otimes |02\\rangle, |m_P\\rangle \\otimes |11\\rangle, |m_P\\rangle \\otimes |20\\rangle,...\\},\n\n$$\nat an energy scale of $\\{2\\Delta_{1,r}+\\delta_1, \\Delta_{1,r} + \\Delta_{2,r}, 2\\Delta_{2,r}+\\delta_2\\}$. The fourth block will correspond to three transmon excitations and four energies of the same order, and in general the $k$'th block will correspond to $k-1$ transmon excitations and $k$ different energies of the same order.\n\nHence $\\text{diag}(H_\\text{sys})$ is written as\n$$\n\n\\text{diag}(H_\\text{sys}) &=\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccccc}\n0_T\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\: \t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t1_T\t&\t \\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t 2_T\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t \\:\t&\t\\:.\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t \\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:.\t&\t\\:\t\\\\\n\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t \\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:\t&\t\\:.\t\\\\\n\\end{array} \\right],\n\n$$\nwhere each block $k_T$ has energy approximately on the order of $k\\Delta_{j,r}$. Since the coupling terms preserve total excitation number there are no coupling terms connecting elements within each block. All coupling terms connect different blocks which are detuned on the order of $\\Delta_{j,r}$, that is there are only couplings between the blocks $((j+1)_P,(k-1)_T)$ and $((j-1)_P,(k+1)_T)$. Since these blocks are detuned on the order of $\\Delta_{j,r}$, which is assumed to be much larger than the coupling strengths $g_j$, the couplings can be adiabatically eliminated to give an effective block-diagonal Hamiltonian for the whole system as outlined via the methods in Sec.\u00a0<ref>. In the dispersive regime where $\\omega_r$ is much larger than the transmon frequencies one can obtain an effective Hamiltonian for the two transmons by projecting onto the zero-excitation subspace of the bus which gives\n$$\n\nH_\\text{sys}^{(0)}=\\sum_{j=1}^2\\left(\\tilde{\\omega}_jb_j^{\\dagger}b_j + \\frac{\\delta_j}{2}b_j^{\\dagger}b_j(b_j^{\\dagger}b_j-1)\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n+ J(b_1^\\dagger b_2 + b_1b_2^{\\dagger}),\\label{eq:Hsys0}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\tilde{\\omega}_1$ and $\\tilde{\\omega}_2$ are the dressed qubit frequencies and to lowest order the exchange coupling is given by\n$$\n\nJ&=\\frac{g_1g_2(\\bar{\\omega}_1+\\bar{\\omega}_2 - 2\\omega_r)}{2(\\bar{\\omega}_1-\\omega_r)(\\bar{\\omega}_2-\\omega_r)}.\n\n$$\nThe general drive Hamiltonian is modeled as\n$$\n\\label{eq:DriveHam}\nH_\\text{d} &=\\sum_{j=1}^2\\left[\\Omega_{X_j}(t)\\cos(\\omega_{d_j}t) + \\Omega_{Y_j}(t)\\sin(\\omega_{d_j}t)\\right](b_j^{\\dagger} + b_j),\n\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_{d_j}$ is the drive frequency on transmon $j$ and $\\Omega_{X_j}(t)$, $\\Omega_{Y_j}(t)$ are the drive amplitudes on the quadratures of transmon $j$. For now we will focus mainly on the case of only a drive term on the $X$ quadrature of qubit 1 (control) which gives a total Hamiltonian\n$$\n\nH_\\text{T}= H_\\text{sys}^{(0)}+H_\\text{d} \\nonumber \\\\\n=\\sum_{j=1}^2\\left(\\tilde{\\omega}_jb_j^{\\dagger}b_j + \\frac{\\delta_j}{2}b_j^{\\dagger}b_j(b_j^{\\dagger}b_j-1) \\right) + J(b_1^\\dagger b_2 + b_1b_2^{\\dagger})\\nonumber \\\\\n+\\sum_{j=1}^2\\left[\\Omega_{X_j}(t)\\cos(\\omega_{d_j}t) + \\Omega_{Y_j}(t)\\sin(\\omega_{d_j}t)\\right](b_j^{\\dagger} + b_j).\\label{eq:TotalHam}\n\n$$\nWe take $H_\\text{T}$ to form the basis of our analysis and analyze the ideal qubit model next.\n\n## Effective CR Hamiltonian for a qubit model\nIn the qubit model the anharmonicity is infinite so the qubit subspace is perfectly isolated and $H_\\text{T}$ is given by\n$$\n\nH_\\text{T} = \\sum_{j=1}^2 \\tilde{\\omega}_jb_j^{\\dagger}b_j  + J(b_1^\\dagger b_2 + b_1b_2^{\\dagger})  + \\Omega(t)\\cos(\\tilde{\\omega}_2 t)(b_1^{\\dagger} + b_1),\n\n$$\nwhere $b_j$ is a two-level operator, the control qubit is driven at the frequency of the target qubit, and for simplicity we assume $\\Omega (t) = \\Omega$ is a constant amplitude drive on the $X$ quadrature of the control qubit only. We derive an exact expression for the full qubit CR Hamiltonian using the method of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and find an effective $ZX$ term that agrees with expressions derived previously using alternative methods\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. First, we move into the frame rotating at $\\tilde{\\omega}_2$ on both qubits and make the RWA by ignoring fast-rotating terms. Writing $\\cos(\\tilde{\\omega}_2 t) = (e^{-i\\tilde{\\omega}_2 t} + e^{i\\tilde{\\omega}_2 t})/2$, defining\n$$\n\nR=e^{-i\\tilde{\\omega}_2\\left(b_1^\\dagger b_1 + b_2^\\dagger b_2\\right)t},\n\n$$\nand ignoring fast-rotating terms gives the Hamiltonian\n$$\n\nH_R &= R^\\dagger H_\\text{T} R -i R^\\dagger \\dot{R} \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\Delta b_1^{\\dagger}b_1 + J(b_1^\\dagger b_2 + b_1b_2^{\\dagger}) + \\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\left(b_1^\\dagger + b_1\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&=\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{cccc}\n0\t\t\t&\t0\t\t\t\t&\t \\Omega/2\t\t&\t0\\\\\n0\t\t\t&\t0\t\t\t\t&\t J\t\t\t\t&\t \\Omega/2\\\\\n\\Omega/2\t&\tJ\t\t\t\t&\t \\Delta\t\t\t&\t0\\\\\n0\t\t\t&\t \\Omega/2\t\t&\t 0\t\t\t\t&\t\\Delta\\\\\n\\end{array} \\right],\n\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta =\\tilde{\\omega}_1-\\tilde{\\omega}_2$. From the form of $H_R$ there are naturally two $2\\times 2$ blocks, one corresponding to the states $|00\\rangle$, $|01\\rangle$ with energy scale $0$ and the other corresponding to the states $|10\\rangle$, $|11\\rangle$ with energy scale $\\Delta$. Using the method of Sec.\u00a0<ref>, which in this case corresponds to the standard Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, one can find the closest block-diagonal Hermitian matrix to $H_R$ under the principle of least action.

The system is then moved into the frame rotating at the target qubit frequency on both qubits and an RWA is performed. In this rotating frame the control $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ states define two subspaces that are far detuned by $\\sim \\Delta$ and an effective block-diagonal Hamiltonian is obtained via the perturbative analysis of Sec.\u00a0<ref>. Unlike the qubit case, exact analytical expressions are not straightforward to obtain and so realistic parameters are used for the exact method of Sec.\u00a0<ref>. For these parameters we find that the perturbative expressions and the exact block-diagonalization agree up to medium power drives of $\\Omega \\sim 50$ MHz with the exact method holding for much larger values of $\\Omega$.\n\nTo start we assume that $\\frac{J}{|\\tilde{\\omega}_1-\\tilde{\\omega}_2|} \\ll 1$ and obtain an effective diagonal Hamiltonian for $H_\\text{sys}^{(0)}$. Letting $U$ be the diagonalizing (dressing) unitary the effective diagonal Hamiltonian is given by\n$$\n\n\\tilde{H}_\\text{sys}^{(0)} = U^\\dagger H_\\text{sys}^{(0)} U,\n\n$$\nwhere to second order in the two-qubit subspace\n$$\n\n\\tilde{H}_\\text{sys}^{(0)} &= \\omega_1 \\frac{Z\\openone}{2} + \\omega_2 \\frac{\\openone Z}{2} + \\xi\\frac{ZZ}{2},\n\n$$\nwith\n$$\n\n\\omega_1 &= -\\tilde{\\omega}_1 - \\frac{J^2}{\\Delta} - \\xi, \\\\\n\\omega_2 &= -\\tilde{\\omega}_2 + \\frac{J^2}{\\Delta} - \\xi, \\\\\n\\xi &= -\\frac{J^2(\\delta_1+\\delta_2)}{(\\Delta + \\delta_1)(\\delta_2-\\Delta)}.\\label{eq:ZZ}\n\n$$\nThe presence of higher levels has produced an effective $ZZ$ interaction in the two-qubit subspace.

The drive frequency on the control transmon, $\\omega_d$, is set to be the average of the dressed target transmon frequencies over the ground and excited states of the control transmon,\n$$\n\n\\omega_d &= \\frac{\\tilde{H}_\\text{sys}^{(0)}(11)-\\tilde{H}_\\text{sys}^{(0)}(10) + \\tilde{H}_\\text{sys}^{(0)}(01)-\\tilde{H}_\\text{sys}^{(0)}(00)}{2}.\\label{eq:omegad}\n\n$$\n\nWe suppose the states are ladder-ordered as $\\{00,01,10,11,02,20,03,12,21,30,....,0d,...,d0\\}$ with $F$ denoting the permutation matrix that moves to ladder ordering from standard Kronecker ordering. To second order in $J$ the $\\{00,01\\}$ subspace has energy $\\frac{J^2}{\\Delta}$, the $\\{10,11\\}$ subspace has energy $\\Delta + \\frac{J^2}{\\Delta}$, and $\\text{\\{rest\\}}$ is assumed to be detuned from both of these subspaces. Loosely speaking, the energy of the state $|jk\\rangle$ is given by\n$$\n\nj\\Delta + \\frac{j(j-1)}{2}\\delta_1 + \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}\\delta_2,\n\n$$\nso that $H_\\text{drift}$ is naturally partitioned according to the relative detunings with respect to $\\omega_d$. Therefore the space can be partitioned as $\\{00,01\\},\\{10,11\\},\\{\\text{rest}\\}$. The off-diagonal elements have a magnitude set by $\\Omega  \\left(\\frac{J}{\\Delta}\\right)^m$ for $m \\geq 0$. Let us now analyze the perturbative approach to obtain analytic expressions in the weak-drive limit and then investigate the exact method under the principle of least action.\n\n### Effective perturbative Hamiltonian\nUnder the assumption $\\frac{\\Omega}{\\Delta} \\ll 1$ a canonical transformation can be perturbatively constructed to find an effective block-diagonal Hamiltonian via the method outlined in Sec\u00a0<ref>. We assume the drive term in Eq.\u00a0<ref> contains only a drive on the $X$ quadrature of the control with a constant amplitude $\\Omega$. The unperturbed Hamiltonian, denoted $H_0$, can be defined in a few different ways. For instance it can be defined via the block-diagonals of $H_{\\text{RWA}}$,\n$$\n\nH_0&=P_{0001}H_\\text{RWA}P_{0001} + P_{1011}H_\\text{RWA}P_{1011} \\nonumber \\\\\n&+ P_{\\text{rest}}H_\\text{RWA}P_{\\text{rest}},\n\n$$\nwith perturbative term given by\n$$\n\nH_1&=\\frac{H_\\text{RWA}-H_0}{\\Omega},\n\n$$\nso that\n$$\n\nH_\\text{RWA} &= H_0 + \\lambda H_1.\n\n$$\n\nUnfortunately, defining $H_0$ to be block-diagonal does not provide simple analytic expressions for the effective block-diagonal Hamiltonian components because one needs to analytically compute the inverse of $H_0$ (see Sec.\u00a0<ref>). As a result, we approach the construction by defining an unperturbed Hamiltonian via the diagonals of $H_{\\text{RWA}}$\n$$\n\nH_0&= \\text{diag}(H_{\\text{RWA}}),\n\n$$\nand define the perturbative term by\n$$\n\nH_1&=\\frac{H_\\text{RWA}-H_0}{\\Omega}.\n\n$$\nAt each order we enforce block-diagonality as usual where the diagonal unperturbed Hamiltonian is treated as block-diagonal. In this picture all terms of the Hamiltonian containing the drive are included in the perturbation Hamiltonian and the inverse of $H_0$ is simple to compute. The order parameter is given by $\\lambda=\\Omega$ and\n$$\n\nH_\\text{RWA} &= H_0 + \\lambda H_1.\n\n$$\n\nThe perturbation proceeds as follows. The effective Hamiltonian takes the form\n$$\n\n\\Heff &=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\lambda^m H^{(m)},\n\n$$\nwhere $H^{(0)} = H_0$ is diagonal (block-diagonal) and for $m > 0$,\n$$\n\nH^{(m)} &= i\\left[S^{(m)},H_0\\right] + H_x^{(m)},\n\n$$\nwith $H_x^{(m)}$ defined in Sec.\u00a0<ref>. We define the $m$'th order approximation to $\\Heff$ by\n$$\n\nH_\\text{eff}^{(m)} &=H^{(0)}+\\lambda H^{(1)} + \\lambda^2 H^{(2)} + ... + \\lambda^m H^{(m)}.\n\n$$\nwhere at each order $H^{(m)}$ is enforced to be block-diagonal by the choice of $S^{(m)}$. Usually for $m=1$, $H_x^{(1)} = H_1$ is orthogonal to the desired form of $\\Heff^{(m)}$ and so $S^{(1)}$ typically eliminates the first-order term $H^{(1)}$. Here however by choosing $H_0$ to be diagonal, $H_1$ has non-zero super/sub-diagonals of order $\\frac{J}{\\Delta}\\Omega$. Therefore while we assume as usual that $S^{(1)}$ is off-block-diagonal, the non-zero super/sub-diagonals of $H_1$ survive to give a contribution at first order in $\\Omega$ so that $H_\\text{eff}^{(1)}$ has leading diagonals of order $ \\frac{J}{\\Delta}\\Omega$ and unchanged diagonal elements (which have shifts of order $\\frac{J^2}{\\Delta}$ from the dressing) .\n\nKeeping terms to first order in $J$,\n$$\n\nH_x^{(2)} &= -\\frac{1}{2}\\left[S^{(1)},\\left[S^{(1)},H_0\\right]\\right] + i\\left[S^{(1)},H_1\\right]\n\n$$\nhas sub/super diagonals equal to 0 and contributions of order $\\Omega^2$ on the diagonals. Thus the second order term contributes only to the diagonals and the off-diagonals of $H_\\text{eff}^{(2)}$ are the same as in the first-order expression,\n$$\n\nH_\\text{eff}^{(1)}[1,2] = H_\\text{eff}^{(2)}[1,2] = -\\frac{J\\Omega_{X,1}}{2\\Delta}, \\nonumber \\\\\nH_\\text{eff}^{(1)}[3,4] = H_\\text{eff}^{(2)}[3,4] = -\\frac{J\\Omega_{X,1}(\\Delta-\\delta_1)}{2\\Delta(\\Delta + \\delta_1)}.\n\n$$\nGoing to third-order one again obtains corrections to the off-diagonals and we use the third-order effective Hamiltonian for the analytic expressions of the Hamiltonian. Moving back into the physical frame to restore the correct energies relative to the respective qubit frequencies gives the final Hamiltonian $H_\\text{CR}$,\n$$\n\nH_\\text{CR} = H_\\text{eff} + \\left(\\omega_d - \\omega_{d_1}\\right)F(b^\\dagger b \\otimes \\openone)F^\\dagger.\n\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\n\\omega_{d_1} &= \\frac{\\tilde{H}_\\text{sys}^{(0)}(11)-\\tilde{H}_\\text{sys}^{(0)}(01) + \\tilde{H}_\\text{sys}^{(0)}(10)-\\tilde{H}_\\text{sys}^{(0)}(00)}{2}\n\n$$\nis the dressed frequency of the control qubit.\n\nThe ZX coefficient to third order is given by\n$$\n\n\\frac{ZX}{2}_\\text{coeff} &= \\frac{ZX}{2}_\\text{linear} \\nonumber \\\\\n& + \\frac{ J\\Omega^3 \\delta_1^2 (3 \\delta_1^3 + 11 \\delta_1^2 \\Delta + 15 \\delta_1 \\Delta^2 + 9 \\Delta^3)\n}{ 2\\Delta^3 (\\delta1 + \\Delta)^3 (\\delta_1 + 2 \\Delta)(3 \\delta_1 + 2 \\Delta)},\n\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\n\\frac{ZX}{2}_\\text{linear}  &= -\\frac{J\\Omega}{\\Delta}\\left(\\frac{\\delta_1}{\\delta_1+\\Delta}\\right),\n\n$$\nand the full set of Pauli coefficients is given in Sec.\u00a0<ref>. The poles in the $ZX$ expression occur at $\\Delta = 0$, $-\\frac{\\delta_1}{2}$, $-\\delta_1$, $-\\frac{3\\delta_1}{2}$.  The point $\\Delta = 0$ corresponds to the qubits on-resonance and the point $\\Delta=-\\delta_1$ corresponds to the $\\omega_{01}^{(1)}=\\omega_{12}^{(2)}$. The points $\\Delta=-\\frac{\\delta_1}{2}$ and $\\Delta=-\\delta_1$, $-\\frac{3\\delta_1}{2}$ are two-photon processes, the first of which corresponds to $\\omega_{01}^{(1)}=\\frac{\\omega_{02}^{(2)}}{2}$. If these points are avoided one expects the perturbative expressions to model the system well in the weak drive limit.\n\n### Effective Hamiltonian from principle of least action\nAn effective block-diagonal CR Hamiltonian obtained under the principle of least action (outlined in Sec.\u00a0<ref>) provides a valid model in the limit of strong drives where the perturbative model breaks down. Since a general analytic expression for the effective Hamiltonian can not be obtained we use the device parameters of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] to form the basis of our study; $\\omega_1/2\\pi = 5.114  \\: \\text{GHz}$, $\\omega_2/2\\pi = 4.914 \\: \\text{GHz}$, $\\delta_ 1/2\\pi = -0.330 \\: \\text{GHz}$, $\\delta_2/2\\pi = -0.330\\: \\text{GHz}$, $g_1/2\\pi = 0.098 \\: \\text{GHz}$, $g_2/2\\pi = 0.083 \\: \\text{GHz}$, $\\omega_r/2\\pi = 6.31 \\: \\text{GHz}$, and $\\xi/2\\pi = 277 \\: \\text{kHz}$. Using the approximation from Eq.<ref>\n$$\n\n\\xi &= -\\frac{2J^2(\\delta_1+\\delta_2)}{(\\Delta_{12}+\\delta_1)(\\delta_2-\\Delta_{12})},\n\n$$\nthe exchange coupling rate is given by $J/2\\pi= 3.8 \\: \\text{MHz}$. Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Allcoeffs_Sarah) contains all of the relevant Pauli coefficients except $ZI$ which is given in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:ZI) and diverges quickly since the control qubit is driven far off-resonance. The presence of higher-levels and finite anharmonicity produces a large $IX$ term in the Hamiltonian that is not present in the pure qubit model. The $ZX$ and $IX$ coefficients have the largest magnitude and so the other coefficients are also contained alone in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:IZ_ZY_IY_ZZ). The $IZ$ and $ZZ$ terms do not deviate significantly from their initial values as the drive amplitude increases. Note that the non-zero offset of the $ZZ$ coefficient corresponds to the static $ZZ$ term.\n\nImportantly, there is no $IY$ term present which is also expected from the perturbative expressions for the Pauli coefficients in Sec.\u00a0<ref>. This is in contrast to the experimental results of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] where there is a large $IY$ component for this for set of parameters. We revisit this discrepancy in Sec.\u00a0<ref>.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nPauli coefficients for model with higher levels.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nZI Pauli coefficient for model with higher levels.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nIY, IZ, ZY, and ZZ Pauli coefficients for model with higher levels.\n\nFig.\u00a0(Figure fig:ZX_Sarah) contains expressions for the $ZX$ term from the different Hamiltonian models; principle of least action, first order perturbative expression, third-order perturbative expression, and the ideal qubit limit. As expected the perturbative expressions match the principle of least action for weak $\\Omega$ but diverge as $\\Omega$ grows large. In addition there is a significant deviation between the $ZX$ coefficient for the perfect qubit model and that from the principle of least action which indicates the presence of higher levels with finite anharmonicity needs to be taken into account for accurate Hamiltonian modeling.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nVarious expressions for $ZX$ term.\n\nNext, both the frequency of the control transmon, $\\omega_1$, and the drive amplitude $\\Omega$ are swept with $\\Delta/2\\pi$ varied from 0 to 600 MHz and $\\Omega/2\\pi$ from 0 to 100 MHz. From the poles in the expressions of the Pauli coefficients found in Sec.\u00a0<ref> one expects that when $\\Delta = -\\frac{\\delta_1}{2}$, $-\\delta_1$, $-\\frac{3\\delta_1}{2}$, $\\Heff$ will be a poor model for $H$. A method for quantifying how well $\\Heff$ captures the full dynamics is discussed in Sec.\u00a0<ref>.\n\nThe $ZX$ coefficient is shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:ZX_2D_Sarah) and up to $-\\delta_1$ there is a sizable $ZX$ rate, however past this point the rate quickly goes to 0. Intuitively this phenomenon is explained by the fact that when two transmons are detuned by an amount greater than their anharmonicity, they begin to look like harmonic oscillators with respect to each other. Therefore since entanglement can not be created between two harmonic oscillators, the $ZX$ term approaches 0 as the detuning $\\Delta$ grows large.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nTwo-dimensional $ZX$ coefficient sweep (color scale in MHz).\n\n## Modeling classical cross-talk from CR drive\nIn Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] a CR gate with the parameters of Sec.\u00a0<ref> was calibrated based on the block-diagonal effective Hamiltonian in a scheme called partial Hamiltonian tomography. A large $IY$ term was found to be present but clearly the results of Sec.\u00a0<ref> predict no such term can arise from from the Hamiltonian model considered to this point. One potential model for the source of this term that we investigate here is classical cross-talk induced on the target from driving the control.\n\nTo analyze this model we go back to Eq.\u00a0<ref> and allow for a drive term on the target qubit whose amplitude and phase depend on the drive on the control. The total drive term then takes the form\n$$\n\\label{eq:Hddiagtwo}\n\\tilde{H}_d&= \\Omega(t)\\cos(\\omega_dt+\\phi_c)\\tilde{B}_1 \\nonumber \\\\\n&+ A\\Omega(t)\\cos(\\omega_dt+ \\phi_t) \\tilde{B}_2,\n\n$$\nwhere $\\tilde{B}_j = U^\\dagger (b_j^{\\dagger} + b_j)U$ for $j=1,2$, $A \\leq 1 $ is a scale factor modeling the amplitude of the cross-talk term, and $\\phi_t$ is the phase lag that occurs on the target. The values of these parameters depend on the form of the cross-talk channel. Since the cross-talk term corresponds directly to a rotation on the target qubit, the condition for block-diagonalization $\\frac{\\Omega}{\\Delta_{12}} \\ll 1$ is unchanged and the methods discussed here can be used to obtain an effective Hamiltonian.\n\nUsing the parameters of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] we find the following values for $A$, $\\phi_c$, and $\\phi_t$,\n$$\n\nA&=0.071,\\nonumber \\\\\n\\phi_c&=\\pi,\\nonumber \\\\\n\\phi_t&=-0.62,\n\n$$\nproduces the Pauli coefficients seen in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Allcoeffs_Sarah_target) which agree well with those in Fig. 2b of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. It is important to note that this agreement only suggests classical cross-talk as a potential source for the presence of the $IY$ term in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Potential sources of cross-talk channels are an area of current investigation.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nVarious Pauli coefficients.\n\n## Discussion\nWe have provided detailed theoretical models of the cross-resonance gate via effective block-diagonal Hamiltonian techniques. For the idealized qubit model, analytic expressions for the Hamiltonian components using the principle of least action\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] were obtained. The only two non-zero components are a large Stark shift term on the control qubit from off-resonant driving as well as the $ZX$ term required for generating entanglement. For the realistic transmon model effective Hamiltonians were constructed via both a perturbative approach as well as the principle of least action. These two approaches agree well in the weak drive limit and predict non-zero Pauli coefficients of the form $A \\otimes B$ with $A \\in \\{I,Z\\}$, $B \\in \\{I,X,Z\\}$. The presence of extra Hamiltonian terms compared to those from the ideal qubit case implies higher levels play an important role to understand the precise error terms for implementing a two-qubit gate.\n\nIn the experiment of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] an $IY$ term was found to be present in contrast to what is predicted from our analysis with a single CR drive on the control transmon. We propose this discrepancy is a result of classical cross-talk between the two transmons and generalized the model to include this effect via an additional phase-shifted drive term on the target transmon. For a set of realistic model parameters we found good agreement between the theoretical results here and those of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] which implies classical cross-talk may be a significant issue in real systems. Understanding the cross-talk channels leading to drive terms on the target transmon is an important area of further research.\n\nVarious interesting questions remain as directions for future research. First, it is useful to understand whether the perturbative construction converges to that of the principle of least action. For the standard two-block Schrieffer-Wolff transformation the perturbative construction does converge to exact unitary rotation and ideally this property holds for the multi-block case as well. It will also be interesting to apply these methods to larger multi-qubit systems, especially in the context of finding points to avoid in frequency space when dealing with fixed-frequency transmons in a circuit-QED architecture. The results from a multi-qubit analysis will have an impact on future design considerations in superconducting circuit systems.\n\n## acknowledgments\nThe authors thank Andrew Cross and Sarah Sheldon for helpful discussions and comments.

We set an orthonormal basis for each $\\mathcal{K}_a$, denoted $\\{|q^{\\mathcal{K}_a}_b\\rangle\\}$, $b=1,...,d_{K_a}$, to be the standard basis for working in coordinates. Note that for each $\\mathcal{K}_a$ any linear combination of the $|q^{\\mathcal{K}_a}_b\\rangle$ is still supported only on $\\mathcal{K}_a$. The full orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{H}$ comprised of the union of these bases will be denoted $\\{|q_a\\rangle\\}$. $H_\\text{eff}$ is uniquely defined by a unitary matrix $T$ that maps the eigenvectors of $H$, $|s_a\\rangle$, to the eigenvectors $|r_a\\rangle$ of $H_\\text{eff}$ with the eigenvalues being preserved since $T$ is unitary. From the desired form of $H_\\text{eff}$ having support only on the $\\mathcal{K}_a$, the sole restriction on the $|r_a\\rangle$ is that the first $d_{\\mathcal{K}_1}$ vectors have support only on $\\mathcal{K}_1$, the next $d_{\\mathcal{K}_2}$ have support only on $\\mathcal{K}_2$, and so on.\n\nLet us now discuss how to actually compute $T$. The first step is to map the eigenvalues of $H$ onto the $\\{|q_j\\rangle\\}$ basis via the eigenvector matrix $X$ of $H$ so that all of the freedom in computing $T$ comes from choosing a block-diagonal (with respect to $\\{|q_j\\rangle\\}$) unitary matrix $F$. Since $H = \\sum_a E_a |s_a\\rangle\\langle s_a |$, the columns of $X$ are equal to $|s_j\\rangle$ when written with respect to the basis $\\{|q_k\\rangle\\}$,\n$$\n\\label{eq:S2def}\nX&=\\sum_j|s_j\\rangle\\langle q_j|,\n\n$$\nand so\n$$\n\nX^\\dagger H X &= \\left(\\sum_j|q_j\\rangle\\langle s_j| \\right)\\left(\\sum_a E_a |s_a\\rangle\\langle s_a |\\right)\\left(\\sum_k|s_k\\rangle\\langle q_k| \\right)\\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\sum_a E_a |q_a\\rangle\\langle q_a |. \\nonumber\n\n$$\nThe unitary matrix $F$ now rotates into the desired eigenbasis $\\{|r_j\\rangle\\}$ and since the $|r_j\\rangle$ only have support on the subspaces $\\mathcal{K}_a$, $F$ represented in $|q_j\\rangle$ is a unitary block-diagonal matrix.\n\nThe total block-diagonalizing unitary $T$ can be written as the composition of $F$ with $X$ where $X$ is given in Eq.\u00a0<ref> and\n$$\n\\label{eq:F2def}\nF&=\\sum_j|r_j\\rangle\\langle q_j|.\n\n$$\n\nIt is clear the freedom in choosing $H_\\text{eff}$ comes entirely from choosing $F$. Ideally, one would like to obtain a unique $H_\\text{eff}$ given $H$. The approach given in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is to solve the following optimization problem:\n$$\n\\label{eq:argmin}\n\\text{argmin}_{F}\\left(\\|T-\\mathcal{I}\\|_2\\right),\n\n$$\nwhich means to find the unitary matrix $F$ that minimizes the 2-norm (Euclidean) distance between $T$ and $\\mathcal{I}$. The unique solution of this problem is given by\n$$\n\nF&=\\frac{X_{BD}}{\\sqrt{X_{BD}X_{BD}^\\dagger}},\\nonumber\n\n$$\nwhere $X_{BD}$ is the projection of $X$ onto the subspaces $\\mathcal{K}_a$ and is assumed to be non-singular. Intuitively this can be thought of as first rotating $H$ into its eigenvalue matrix and attempting to rotate back to $H$ under the constraint of block-diagonality.\n\nThere are a variety of different metrics one could use to quantify the extent to which $H_\\text{eff}$ captures the dynamics of $H$. For instance one could directly compute the objective function in Eq.\u00a0<ref>. Alternatively, one can see that $H=H_\\text{eff}$ if and only if $X=X_{BD}$ and if the eigenvectors of $H$ are highly mixed across different blocks then the quality of $H_\\text{eff}$ as a model of $H$ decreases. As a result one can define a simple figure of merit, denoted $I(\\Heff)$, to be the normalized sum of the squared magnitudes of the eigenvectors of $H$ after being projected onto the subspaces $\\mathcal{K}_a$,\n$$\n\nI(\\Heff) &= \\frac{\\text{tr}\\left(X_{BD}X_{BD}^\\dagger\\right)}{\\text{dim}(\\mathcal{H})} = \\frac{\\|X_{BD}\\|_2^2}{\\text{dim}(\\mathcal{H})}.\\nonumber\n\n$$\nSince\n$$\n\n0 \\leq \\text{tr}\\left(X_{BD}X_{BD}^\\dagger\\right) \\leq \\text{dim}(\\mathcal{H}),\\nonumber\n\n$$\n$I(\\Heff) \\in [0,1]$. A plot of $I(\\Heff)$ for the parameters of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is contained in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:IHeff_2D_Sarah) where the control transmon frequency is fixed $\\omega_1/2\\pi = 5.114$ GHz. As expected $I(\\Heff)$ deviates from 1 near the poles predicted from the perturbative analysis in Sec.\u00a0<ref>\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n$I(\\Heff)$ with transmon detuning and drive power.\n\n### Effective Hamiltonian from perturbative construction of canonical transformations\nIn this section we will discuss how to perturbatively obtain a canonical transformation $U=e^{-i S}$ and an effective Hamiltonian $\\Heff$ that describes the dynamics of our system. We will focus our attention on the case where we have an unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0$ that we can solve exactly and a perturbative term $H_1$ with order parameter $\\lambda$ such that\n$$\n\nH&=H_0+\\lambda H_1. \\nonumber\n\n$$\nObtaining $\\Heff$ from $H$ depends on the desired form we would like $\\Heff$ to have.  Here, we derive an iterative procedure to build the Hermitian matrix $S$ which provides the desired form of the Hamiltonian. Common examples of this method corresponds to diagonalization of $H$ and modeling the dynamics on the low-energy subspace as in the standard Schrieffer-Wolff (SW) transformation. We apply these methods to provide a complete perturbative solution to the simultaneous block-diagonalization of $H$ into an arbitrary number of blocks. In the case of two blocks the standard SW transformation is recovered.\n\nThe Hermitian operator $S$ in $U=e^{-iS}$ can be expanded as\n$$\n\nS &=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\lambda^nS_n.\\nonumber\n\n$$\nComputing powers of $S$ results in the expressions\n$$\n\nS&= \\lambda S_1 + \\lambda^2 S_2 + \\lambda^3 S_3 + \\lambda^4 S_4 +...\\nonumber \\\\\nS^2 &=  \\lambda^2 S_1^2 + \\lambda^3 (S_1 S_2 + S_2S_1) + \\lambda^4(S_2^2 + S_1S_3 + S_3S_1) + ...\\nonumber \\\\\nS^3 &= \\lambda^3  S_1^3 + \\lambda^4 (S_1^2 S_2 +S_1S_2S_1 + S_2S_1^2 ) +...\\nonumber \\\\\nS^4 &= \\lambda^4 S_1^4 + ....\\nonumber\n\n$$\nWe can expand $U=e^{\\pm iS}$ in an exponential series to obtain\n$$\n\ne^{\\pm i S} &= \\openone \\pm i(\\lambda S_1 + \\lambda^2 S_2 + \\lambda^3 S_3 + \\lambda^4 S_4 + ...) \\nonumber \\\\\n&- \\frac{1}{2!} (\\lambda^2 S_1^2 + \\lambda^3 (S_1S_2 + S_2 S_1 + ...) \\nonumber \\\\\n&+ \\lambda^4 (S_2^2 + S_1S_3 + S_3S_1 +...))\\nonumber \\\\\n& \\mp \\frac{i}{3!} (\\lambda^3 S_1^3 + \\lambda^4(S_1^2S_2 + S_1S_2S_1 + S_2S_1^2) + ...) \\nonumber \\\\\n&+ \\frac{1}{4!}\\left(\\lambda^4 S_1^4 + ...\\right) + ...\\nonumber\n\n$$\nCollecting in powers of $\\lambda$ we have\n$$\n\ne^{\\pm i S} &= \\openone + \\lambda(\\pm i S_1) + \\lambda^2 \\left(\\pm i S_2-\\frac{1}{2}S_1^2\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&+ \\lambda^3\\left(\\pm i S_3 -

What remains is to compute the $S_j$ which is done by noting that at each order, $H^{(k)}\\left(\\{S_j\\}_{j=1}^k,H_0,V\\right)$ contains only one term with $S_k$ in it, $i[S_k,H_0]$. Hence one can write\n$$\n\\label{eq:Hm}\nH^{(m)}\\left(\\{S_j\\}_{j=1}^m,H_0,V\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n= i[S_m,H_0] + H_x^{(m)}\\left(\\{S_j\\}_{j=1}^{m-1},H_0,V\\right),\\label{eq:Hm}\n\n$$\nand assuming $\\{S_j\\}_{j=1}^{k-1}$ have already been computed, $H_x^{(k)}$ can be computed as well. Hence one need only solve for $S_k$ at each order to compute $H^{(k)}$. $S_k$ is computed by ensuring $H^{(k)}$ satisfies the required form set by the problem. We now illustrate the method with two examples, diagonalization and block-diagonalization.\n\n#### Example 1: Diagonalization\nSuppose we want our effective dynamics to be diagonal at each order $m$, that is we want $H^{(m)}$ to be diagonal for every $m$ ($H_0$ is diagonal and $V$ is a perturbation containing off-diagonal components). We have\n$$\n\nH^{(0)} &= H_0, \\nonumber \\\\\nH_x^{(1)} &= H_1.\\nonumber\n\n$$\nOne can see from Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) that if $H^{(m)}$ is diagonal\n$$\n\n\\sum_pE_p^{(m)} |p\\rangle\\langle p| &= i \\sum_pE_p^{(0)}(S^{(m)}|p\\rangle\\langle p| - |p\\rangle\\langle p|S^{(m)}) \\nonumber \\\\\n& + H_x^{(m)}.\n\n$$\nWithout loss of generality we can assume that $S$ is an off-diagonal matrix (has diagonal entries of $0$) and so the above is satisfied if\n$$\n\nE_p^{(m)} &= \\langle p|H_x^{(m)} |p\\rangle, \\nonumber \\\\\n\\langle p|S^{(m)}|q\\rangle &= \\frac{-i\\langle p |H_x^{(m)} |q\\rangle}{E_p^{(0)} - E_q^{(0)}}, p \\neq q.\\nonumber\n\n$$\n\n#### Example 2: Block-Diagonalization\nSuppose we want our effective dynamics to be block-diagonal at each order $m$, that is we want $H^{(m)}$ to be block-diagonal for every $m$ ($H_0$ is block-diagonal and $V$ is a perturbation containing off-block-diagonal components). We have\n$$\n\nH^{(0)} &= H_0, \\nonumber \\\\\nH_x^{(1)} &= H_1.\\nonumber\n\n$$\nOne can see from Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) that if $H^{(m)}$ is block-diagonal\n$$\n\nH^{(m)} & = H_1^{(m)} \\oplus ... \\oplus H_k^{(m)} \\oplus ... \\nonumber\n\n$$\nthen acting subspace projectors $P_j$ and $P_k$ on both sides of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) gives\n$$\n\nP_j  H_1^{(m)} \\oplus ... \\oplus H_k^{(m)} \\oplus ... P_k \\nonumber \\\\\n= i \\Big(P_j S^{(m)} ( H_1^{(0)} \\oplus ... \\oplus H_k^{(0)} \\oplus ...) P_k \\nonumber \\\\\n- P_j  ( H_1^{(0)} \\oplus ... \\oplus H_k^{(0)} \\oplus ...) S^{(m)}\\Big) P_k + P_j H_x^{(m)} P_k, \\nonumber\n\n$$\n$$\n\nH_j^{(m)}\\delta_{j,k} = i(P_j S^{(m)} P_k H_k^{(0)} - H_j^{(0)} P_j S^{(m)} P_k) + H_{x_{j,k}}^{(m)}, \\nonumber\n\n$$\nand\n$$\n\ni H_{x_{j,k}}^{(m)} + H_j^{(m)} \\delta_{j,k} = S_{j,k}^{(m)}H_k^{(0)} - H_j^{(0)} S_{j,k}^{(m)}. \\nonumber\n\n$$\nSince $S$ is an off-block-diagonal matrix (has block-diagonal entries of $0$) we have\n$$\n\nH_j^{(m)} &=  H_{x_{j,j}}^{(m)}, \\text{if} \\: j=k, \\nonumber \\\\\nH_j^{(0)} S_{j,k}^{(m)} - S_{j,k}^{(m)}H_k^{(0)}  &= - i H_{x_{j,k}}^{(m)},  \\text{if } \\:  j \\neq k. \\nonumber\n\n$$\n\nIn the case that $H^{(0)}$ is diagonal we can solve easily for $S^{(m)}$ at each order,\n$$\n\n\\langle p|S_{j,k}^{(m)}|q\\rangle &= \\frac{-i\\langle p |H_{x_{j,k}}^{(m)} |q\\rangle}{\\langle p| H_j^{(0)} |p \\rangle - \\langle q |H_k^{(0)} |q\\rangle}. \\nonumber\n\n$$\nHowever if $H^{(0)}$ is not diagonal we need to use the following matrix-vector correspondence. For any $A$, $B$, $C$\n$$\n\n(A\\otimes B)\\text{vec}(C) &= \\text{vec}(ACB^T), \\nonumber\n\n$$\nwhere \u201c$\\text{vec}$\" is defined as $\\text{vec}(|a\\rangle \\langle b|) = |a\\rangle \\otimes |b\\rangle$.\nHence\n$$\n\nAB-BC = D\\nonumber &\\Leftrightarrow \\nonumber \\\\\nAB\\openone^T - \\openone BC = D &\\Leftrightarrow \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{vec}(AB\\openone^T) - \\text{vec}( \\openone BC) = \\text{vec}(D) &\\Leftrightarrow \\nonumber \\\\\n(A\\otimes \\openone - \\openone \\otimes C^T) \\text{vec}(B) = \\text{vec}(D) &\\Leftrightarrow \\nonumber \\\\\n\\text{vec}(B) = (A\\otimes \\openone - \\openone \\otimes C^T)^{-1}\\text{vec}(D) &\\Leftrightarrow \\nonumber \\\\\nB = \\text{mat}\\left(  (A\\otimes \\openone - \\openone \\otimes C^T)^{-1}\\text{vec}(D)\\right). \\nonumber\n\n$$\nLetting\n$$\n\nA&= H_j^{(0)} \\nonumber \\\\\nB&= S_{j,k}^{(m)}\\nonumber \\\\\nC&= H_k^{(0)} \\nonumber \\\\\nD&=  - i H_{x_{j,k}}^{(m)}, \\nonumber\n\n$$\nallows for $S_{j,k}^{(m)}$ to be solved at each order $m$.\n\n#### Summary of results for perturbative construction\nThe main result is\n$$\n\n\\Heff &= U^\\dagger H U = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\lambda^m H^{(m)}, \\nonumber\n\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\nH^{(m)} &= H^{(m)}\\left(\\{S_j\\}_{j=1}^m,H_0,H_1\\right) \\nonumber \\\\\n&= i[S_m,H_0] + H_x^{(m)}\\left(\\{S_j\\}_{j=1}^{m-1},H_0,H_1\\right). \\nonumber\n\n$$\n\nAt each order $m$, $H_x^{(m)}$ is a function of only $\\{S_1,...,S_{m-1}\\}$ and so can be computed since we assume the lower order $\\{S_1,...,S_{m-1}\\}$ are known. Hence $H^{(m)}\\left(\\{S_j\\}_{j=1}^m,H_0,H_1\\right)$ has only one term containing $S_m$, $i[S_m,H_0]$. Solving for $S_m$ subject to the desired dynamics allows for computation of $H^{(m)}$. For instance in the case of the SW transformation, the desired dynamics is to have $H^{(m)}$ be block-diagonal on $H_l$ and $H_e$.\n\nWe have\n$$\n\nH^{(0)} &= H_0, \\nonumber \\\\\nH_x^{(1)} &= H_1. \\nonumber\n\n$$\nIf $H^{(m)}$ is block-diagonal\n$$\n\nH^{(m)} & = H_1^{(m)} \\oplus ... \\oplus H_k^{(m)} \\oplus ... \\nonumber\n\n$$\nthen since $S$ can without loss of generality be an off-block-diagonal matrix (the block-diagonal entries of $S$ are $0$)\n$$\n\nH_j^{(m)} &=  H_{x_{j,j}}^{(m)}, \\text{if} \\: j=k, \\nonumber \\\\\nH_j^{(0)} S_{j,k}^{(m)} - S_{j,k}^{(m)}H_k^{(0)}  &= - i H_{x_{j,k}}^{(m)},  \\text{if } \\:  j \\neq k. \\nonumber\n\n$$\nNote that if $H^{(0)}$ is diagonal then\n$$\n\n\\langle p|S_{j,k}^{(m)}|q\\rangle &= \\frac{-i\\langle p |H_{x_{j,k}}^{(m)} |q\\rangle}{\\langle p| H_j^{(0)} |p \\rangle - \\langle q |H_k^{(0)} |q\\rangle}. \\nonumber\n\n$$\nIf $H^{(0)}$ is not diagonal we use the following matrix-vector correspondence\n$$\n\n(A\\otimes B)\\text{vec}(C) &= \\text{vec}(ACB^T),\\nonumber\n\n$$\nwhich holds for any $A$, $B$, $C$, where \u201c$\\text{vec}$\" is defined as $\\text{vec}(|a\\rangle \\langle b|) = |a\\rangle \\otimes |b\\rangle$.\nHence\n$$\n\nAB-BC= D\\nonumber &\\Leftrightarrow B = \\text{mat}\\left(  (A\\otimes \\openone - \\openone \\otimes C^T)^{-1}\\text{vec}(D)\\right). \\nonumber\n\n$$\nLetting $A= H_j^{(0)}$, $B= S_{j,k}^{(m)}$, $C= H_k^{(0)}$, and $D=  - i H_{x_{j,k}}^{(m)}$ allows us to solve for $S_{j,k}^{(m)}$ at each order $m$.\n\n## Making the RWA in the Duffing model case\nWe move into a frame rotating at $\\omega_d$ on both qubits. The unitary operator $R$ corresponding to this frame transformation is defined by the Hamiltonian $\\tilde{H}_A = \\omega_d(b_1^\\dagger b_1 +  b_2^\\dagger b_2)$,\n$$\n\nR&=e^{-i\\left[ \\omega_d(b_1^\\dagger b_1 +  b_2^\\dagger b_2)\\right]t}. \\nonumber\n\n$$\nThis gives the Hamiltonian\n$$\n\n\\tilde{H}_\\text{sys}^{(0)}-\\tilde{H}_A + R^\\dagger \\tilde{H}_d R &=: \\tilde{H}_\\text{drift} + R^\\dagger \\tilde{H}_d R. \\nonumber\n\n$$\nLet us now focus on the term $R^\\dagger \\tilde{H}_d R$ and make the RWA, which amounts to ignoring all excitations of energy cost $2\\omega_d$ or higher.\n\nWe have\n$$\n\n&R^\\dagger \\tilde{H}_d R \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\sum_{j=1}^2\\left[\\Omega_{X_j}(t)\\cos(\\omega_dt) + \\Omega_{Y_j}(t)\\sin(\\omega_dt)\\right]R^\\dagger \\tilde{B}_j R \\nonumber \\\\\n&= \\sum_{j=1}^2\\Big[\\Omega_{X_j}(t)\\left(\\frac{e^{i\\omega_dt} + e^{-i\\omega_dt}}{2}\\right) - \\nonumber \\\\\n& \\: \\: \\: \\: \\: \\: \\: \\: \\: \\: \\: \\: \\: \\: \\: \\:  i\\Omega_{Y_j}(t)\\left(\\frac{e^{i\\omega_dt} -  e^{-i\\omega_dt}}{2}\\right)\\Big]R^\\dagger \\tilde{B}_j R.\\nonumber\n\n$$\nFirst, let's analyze the term $R^\\dagger \\tilde{B}_1 R$,\n$$\n\nR^\\dagger \\tilde{B}_1 R &= e^{-i\\omega_d(b_1^\\dagger b_1 + b_2^\\dagger b_2)t} \\tilde{B}_1 e^{i\\omega_d(b_1^\\dagger b_1 + b_2^\\dagger b_2)t}. \\nonumber\n\n$$\nLet\n$$\n\n\\tilde{B}_1 &= \\sum_{i_1,i_2,j_1,j_2}\\tilde{B}_1^{i_1,i_2,j_1,j_2}|i_1d+i_2\\rangle \\langle j_1d + j_2|, \\nonumber\n\n$$\nand\n$$\n\ne^{-i\\omega_d(b_1^\\dagger b_1 + b_2^\\dagger b_2)t} &= \\sum_{i_1,i_2}e^{-i\\omega_dt(i_1+i_2)}|i_1d + i_2\\rangle\\langle i_1d+i_2|, \\nonumber\n\n$$\nwhere the index in each sum is taken from $0$ to $d-1$.

To address this, we initialized each qubit in either the ground or excited state at the beginning of each experiment via projective readout and heralded the desired initial state\u00a0[Johnson, JE, Macklin, Christopher, Slichter, DH, Vijay, R, Weingarten, EB, Clarke, John, Siddiqi, Irfan, \"Heralded state preparation in a superconducting qubit\", 2012] (see appendix:readout for further details). To realize independent qubit initialization in our system, each qubit was capacitively coupled to a separate readout resonator, allowing us to perform high-fidelity, single-shot readout within the full computational basis. All three resonators were further coupled to a common Purcell filter\u00a0[Sete, Eyob A, Martinis, John M, Korotkov, Alexander N, \"Quantum theory of a bandpass Purcell filter for qubit readout\", 2015].\n\nSpecific wiring and layout\nWe used a global biasing coil to tune the flux across the entire device and used additional local flux lines biased through coaxial cables for independent control of each qubit.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Bosonic codes with superconducting cavities' section of the paper.", "completion": "Bosonic codes \u2013 those built from the internal states of a QHO \u2013 represent a different approach to demonstrating error-resilient qubits. Rather than encoding a logical qubit in the shared state of many two-level systems, as in the surface code, a bosonic code constructs a logical qubit from the many energy levels of a single quantum object (in this context, typically the long-lived photonic states of a superconducting cavity). Bosonic codes have had a remarkably rapid development trajectory and are now leading the superconducting qubit field in early prototype demonstrations of fault-tolerant error-corrected quantum computing. A few broad categories of bosonic codespaces have been considered, namely:\n\nFock-state encodings: Qubits are mapped onto the $|0/1\\rangle$ Fock states and form a direct analogy to a traditional spin 1/2 qubit encoding. Fock states are the longest-lived QHO qubits, but do not implement a bosonic code.\nExample cat codes\nThe `2-cat code': $|{0/1}\\rangle_L = |{\\alpha}\\rangle \\pm |{-\\alpha}\\rangle$\nThe `4-cat code': $|{0/1}\\rangle_L = |{\\alpha}\\rangle + |{-\\alpha}\\rangle \\pm |{i\\alpha}\\rangle \\pm |{-i\\alpha}\\rangle$\n\nExample binomial codesEncoding 1:\n\n$|{0}\\rangle_L = |{2}\\rangle$\n$|{1}\\rangle_L = \\frac{|{0}\\rangle + |{4}\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$\nEncoding 2:\n\n$|{0/1}\\rangle_L = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{|{0}\\rangle + |{4}\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}} \\pm |{2}\\rangle\\right)$\nInstead, they are the benchmark against which to evaluate the QEC logical qubit lifetime.\n\nCat codes [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]: Qubits are formed using superpositions of coherent states. The superpositions are chosen such that the loss of a single photon maps the system onto a detectable and correctable error space while maintaining the encoded information. Cat codes require a relatively large $\\overline{n}$ in order to approach orthogonality in the codespace. With sufficiently high $\\overline{n}$, error correction can be performed at the end of the experimental cycle as long as error detection is performed quasi-continuously.\n\nBinomial codes [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]: Qubits are defined via a finite number of Fock states with binomial coefficients. Binomial codes comprise exactly orthogonal logical states constructed such that photon loss maps the system onto a correctable error space. The codespace can be constructed to allow for multiple photon losses at the expense of higher $\\overline{n}$. Binomial codes are in some sense a hybrid between Fock encodings, which are not correctable, and cat states, which require larger $\\overline{n}$ and are not exactly orthogonal. QEC on a binomial code requires correction at the time of detection.\n\nRecent demonstrations have confirmed the potential of bosonic codes in QEC and for fault-tolerant quantum computing. The initial demonstration of mapping an arbitrary qubit state onto a cat state was performed in 2013 by Vlastakis et al. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Error detection was demonstrated by observing parity jumps [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], with fidelity limited by the relatively short lifetime of the transmon ancilla qubit used to read and control the cavity state. Universal control of cavity states in general [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and of logical bosonic codes in particular [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] were demonstrated, enabling measurement-based QEC of cat codes [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and binomial codes [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The former demonstration surpassed the break-even point by showing an error-corrected lifetime $T_{1, \\text{QEC}}$ greater than the Fock state lifetime $T_{1,\\text{Fock}}$; the latter came very close to this threshold and additionally demonstrated high-fidelity (although not error-corrected) operations on the logical single qubits.\n\nBeyond single logical qubit demonstrations, there have been several recent demonstrations of entanglement generation and two-qubit gates between the encoded bosonic qubit states. These demonstrations include a logical  [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ],  gate teleportation between two error-correctable qubits machined from the same aluminum block [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], logical state transfer and remote entanglement between qubits separated by a long delay cable [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and an exponential-SWAP operation [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. While these multi-qubit experiments do not yet include active error correction, they have shown the feasibility of operations on logical states, and represent continuing progress towards universal QEC using superconducting hardware."}

The cooldown of cable trees comprising up to 25 identical lines of a given type has the advantage of generating temperature increases that are larger than typical run-to-run temperature variations on the stages of the dilution refrigerator.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Josephson Junction' section of the paper.", "completion": "Superconducting resonators alone do not provide a useful medium for encoding quantum information. This is because the energy levels of a resonator are separated by an equal spacing of $\\hbar\\omega$, forbidding us from addressing the transitions individually. Thus, we must introduce a non-linear element in order to achieve universal quantum control of the circuit.\n\nIn cQED, the most ubiquitous source of non-linearity is a Josephson junction (JJ), favored for its simplicity and non-dissipative nature. This element is made of two superconducting electrodes separated by an insulating tunnel barrier, represented in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:dispersive_coupling)(a). In practice, JJs are typically fabricated by overlapping two layers of superconducting films with an oxide barrier in between. The area of the overlap and the properties of the oxide barrier determine the properties of the JJ.\nAn SEM image of a typical JJ is depicted in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:dispersive_coupling)(b).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDispersive coupling between a transmon and a superconducting resonator.

Here, we aim to provide a brief intuitive picture that follows the line of Josephson's original work [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Let us consider each side of the JJ as a superconducting island containing a certain number of Cooper pairs. The joint state of the junction is described by the difference in number of Cooper pairs $\\bn$, which is the same observable used in our treatment of the simple LC circuit. As Cooper pairs tunnel across the junction, $\\bn$ varies accordingly. Therefore, the Hamiltonian of a Josephson junction can intuitively be written in the charge basis as\n$$\n\n\\bH_J/\\hbar = -\\frac{E_J}{2}\\sum^{+\\infty}_{n=-\\infty}\\left(\\ket{n}\\bra{n+1} + \\ket{n+1}\\bra{n}\\right),\n\n$$\nwhere $E_J$ is the Josephson energy, which is traditionally expressed in units of frequency by dividing it by $\\hbar$. We identify that the two parts of $\\bH_J$, i.e. $\\sum^{+\\infty}_{n=-\\infty}\\ket{n+1}\\bra{n}$ and its Hermitian conjugate, are unitary operators that translate the charge by one unit up and down respectively. This translation can also be written in the conjugate basis as $e^{\\pm i\\bphi}$, similar to how a position translation is written in terms of the momentum operator. Therefore, the Josephson Hamiltonian in the flux basis can be expressed as\n$$\n\n\\bH_J/\\hbar = -E_J \\cos{\\bphi}.\n\n$$\nDeveloping the cosine potential to second order gives rise to a quadratic term that resembles an inductive energy as described in Eq.\u00a0<ref>. This is commonly referred to as the Josephson inductance $L_J = \\hbar^2/(4e^2 E_J)$. As we will show in the case of the transmon, this non-linear inductance affords us the ability to selectively address individual transitions in the system."}

This is because the\ntransmon and Xmon qubits are only slightly different from a linear\noscillator, for which $\\tilde{g}=\\sqrt{2}\\, g$ and $\\delta_{\\rm\nq}=0$, thus leading to $\\chi=0$. The effect of nonzero anharmonicity $\\delta_{\\rm\nq}$ in Eq. (<ref>) is more important than the effect of nonzero\n$\\tilde{g}-\\sqrt{2}\\, g$ because\ng\u0303^2/2-g^2 \u2248- g^2 \u03b4_q/\u03c9_q^b\nand $|\\Delta|\\ll\n\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}$.

For\n$n$ beyond this range it is still possible (at least to some extent)\nto use the dispersive approximation (<ref>) if the spread of\n$n$ is relatively small; however $\\omega_{\\rm q}$, $\\omega_{\\rm r}$,\nand $\\chi$ should be redefined. For that we need to use similar\nsteps as in Eqs. (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>), but\nstarting with more accurate formulas than (<ref>) and\n(<ref>). In particular, in the two-level approximation\nfor the qubit ($\\tilde{g}=0$ or $\\delta_{\\rm q}=\\infty$) we would\nobtain $\\chi \\approx g^2/\\sqrt{\\Delta^2+4\\bar{n}g^2}$ with $\\bar{n}$\nbeing the average (typical) number of photons; however,\nthe generalization of the realistic case (<ref>) is not so\nsimple (see below).\n\nThe dispersive approximation (<ref>) cannot reproduce the\nPurcell effect [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] after including the last line of the\nHamiltonian (<ref>), so it should be added\nseparately. Without the microwave drive ($\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}=0$)\nonly levels $|e,0\\rangle$, $|g,1\\rangle$ and $|g,0\\rangle$ are\ninvolved into the evolution described by Eq.(<ref>), and for sufficiently small resonator\nbandwidth, $\\kappa \\ll \\sqrt{\\Delta^2+4g^2}$, the qubit relaxation\nrate due to Purcell effect is\n\u0393\u2248\u03ba/2 ( 1-\n|\u0394|/\u221a(\u0394^2+4g^2) ) \u2248g^2 \u03ba/\u0394^2.\nNote that this rate does not depend on the qubit anharmonicity\n$\\delta_{\\rm q}$, in contrast to the dispersive coupling $\\chi$,\nwhich vanishes at $\\delta_{\\rm q} \\rightarrow 0$. This is because\nthe Purcell effect is essentially a linear effect (energy decay via\ndecay of a coupled system), in contrast to $\\chi$, which is based on\nqubit nonlinearity. This linearity is the reason why the Purcell\nrate $\\Gamma$ does not change (in the first approximation) when the\nmicrowave drive $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$ creates a significant photon\npopulation in the resonator, $1\\ll n \\ll \\min (n_{\\rm crit},\n\\tilde{n}_{\\rm crit})$. (Someone might naively expect that $\\Gamma$\nscales with $n$ because of effective coupling $\\sqrt{n}\\, g$.)\nHowever, in the next approximation $\\Gamma$ depends on $n$\n[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and can be calculated as\n\u0393(n) = \u03ba  |\u27e8g, n| a\n|e,n\u27e9|^2,\nwith subsequent replacement of $n$ with the average photon number\n$\\bar{n}$ if the spread of $n$ is relatively small.\n\nUsing the third-order (in $g$ and/or $\\tilde{g}$) eigenstates,\n$$\n\n&    \\overline{|g,n\\rangle } = \\left( 1-\\frac{n\ng^2}{2\\Delta^2}\\right) |g,n\\rangle +\\frac{\\sqrt{n(n-1)}\\, g\n\\tilde{g}}{\\Delta(2\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q})} \\, |f,n-2\\rangle\n\\nonumber \\\\\n& \\hspace{0.5cm}   -\\frac{\\sqrt{n}\\, g}{\\Delta} \\left( 1-\\frac{3n g^2}{2\\Delta^2} + \\frac{(n-1)\\tilde{g}^2}{\\Delta(2\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q})}\\right)  |e,n-1\\rangle ,\n\\label{g,n-eigen}\\\\\n& \\overline{|e,n\\rangle } \\approx \\left( 1-\\frac{(n+1) g^2}{2\\Delta^2}\n-\\frac{n \\tilde{g}^2}{2(\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q})^2}\\right) |e,n\\rangle\n\\nonumber \\\\\n& \\hspace{0.5cm} + \\frac{\\sqrt{n+1}\\, g}{\\Delta} \\left( 1- \\frac{3(n+1) g^2}{2\\Delta^2} +\\frac{n\\tilde{g}^2 (\\Delta-2\\delta_{\\rm q})}{2\\Delta (\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q})^2} \\right)\n\\nonumber \\\\\n& \\hspace{0.5cm} \\times  |g,n+1\\rangle\n-  \\frac{\\sqrt{n}\\, \\tilde{g}}{\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q}} \\,\n|f,n-1\\rangle ,\n\\label{e,n-eigen}\n$$\nwhere the last term in Eq.

This result\ncoincides with the result of Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] when $\\tilde{g}=0$.\nApproximating $\\tilde{g}=\\sqrt{2}\\, g$ [see Eq.(<ref>)], we obtain\n\u0393(n) \u2248\u03bag^2/\u0394^2 (\n1- 3g^2/\u0394^2\n+ n   2g^2 \u03b4_q (2\u0394-3\u03b4_q)/\u0394^2 (\u0394-\u03b4_q)^2 ) .\nIt is interesting to note that while in the two-level approximation\n($\\tilde{g}=0$) the Purcell rate is always suppressed with increasing\n$n$ [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], Eq. (<ref>) shows the suppression only\nwhen $\\Delta < (3/2)\\delta_{\\rm q}$ (which is the usual experimental\ncase, since $\\Delta$ is usually negative). Numerical results using\nEq. (<ref>) show that even when $\\Gamma(n)$ initially\nincreases with $n$, it is still suppressed at larger $n$. Note that the result (<ref>) requires\nassumption (<ref>) of a sufficiently small nonlinearity.\nComparing Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>), we see\nthat in the case of large detuning, $|\\Delta|\\gg \\delta_{\\rm q}$,\nthe dependence of the Purcell rate on $n$ is consistent with the\nexplanation based on the ac Stark shift, $\\Gamma (n)\\approx \\kappa\ng^2/ (\\Delta +2n \\chi)^2$. (This is in contrast to the two-level\napproximation, in which this explanation leads to a discrepancy\nin the slope [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] by a factor of $3/2$.) We have checked that taking into account the fourth level in the qubit does not change Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>); there are no additional contributions of the order $g^4$.\n\nBesides the qubit energy relaxation $\\Gamma$, the resonator damping\n$\\kappa$ in the presence of drive leads to the qubit excitation [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n$|g\\rangle \\rightarrow |e\\rangle$ with the rate $\\Gamma_{|g\\rangle \\rightarrow |e\\rangle}=\\kappa \\,\n|\\overline{\\langle e, n-2|} a \\overline{|g,n\\rangle }|^2$ and the\nexcitation $|e\\rangle \\rightarrow |f\\rangle$ with the rate $\\Gamma_{|e\\rangle \\rightarrow |f\\rangle}=\\kappa\n\\, |\\overline{\\langle f, n-2|} a \\overline{|e,n\\rangle }|^2$.

This result predicts a quite strong $n$-dependence of $\\chi$, which is, however, not correct. The reason is that it is not sufficient to consider three qubit levels for $\\chi(n)$. When the\nfourth level of the qubit is taken into account (with energy $3\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-3\\delta_{\\rm q}$ and coupling $\\tilde{\\tilde g}$), this does not change Eq.

(<ref>) creates an additional contribution $g^2\\delta_{\\rm q}/[\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}(\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q})]$ to $\\chi$, which for typical parameters is much larger than the second terms in Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>). The correction (<ref>) also yields an additional $n$-dependent contribution of\napproximately $2g^4\\delta_{\\rm q}n/(\\Delta^3\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b})$ (assuming $\\delta_{\\rm q}\\ll |\\Delta |$) to both $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle}(n)$ and $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}(n)$. These additional slopes are comparable to the slope of $\\chi(n)$ in Eq. (<ref>) because $\\Delta^2/(\\delta_{\\rm q}\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b})$ is on the order of 1 for typical experimental parameters. However, the contribution to $\\chi(n)$ from the correction (<ref>) is only $9 g^4\\delta_{\\rm q}^2n/(\\Delta^4 \\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b})$ (assuming $\\delta_{\\rm q}\\ll |\\Delta |$), which is smaller than the last term in Eq. (<ref>) because $|\\Delta |\\ll\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}$. Therefore, the slope of $\\chi(n)$ in Eq. (<ref>) is practically not affected by the correction (<ref>). Similarly, inaccuracy of our approximation of the fourth qubit level energy by $3\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-3\\delta_{\\rm q}$ produces only a small correction to the slope of $\\chi(n)$: the correction to the fourth-level energy is on the order of $\\delta_{\\rm q}^2/\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}$, and therefore the correction to $\\chi (n)$ [via Eq.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Josephson Junction' section of the paper.", "completion": "Superconducting resonators alone do not provide a useful medium for encoding quantum information. This is because the energy levels of a resonator are separated by an equal spacing of $\\hbar\\omega$, forbidding us from addressing the transitions individually. Thus, we must introduce a non-linear element in order to achieve universal quantum control of the circuit.\n\nIn cQED, the most ubiquitous source of non-linearity is a Josephson junction (JJ), favored for its simplicity and non-dissipative nature. This element is made of two superconducting electrodes separated by an insulating tunnel barrier, represented in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:dispersive_coupling)(a). In practice, JJs are typically fabricated by overlapping two layers of superconducting films with an oxide barrier in between. The area of the overlap and the properties of the oxide barrier determine the properties of the JJ.\nAn SEM image of a typical JJ is depicted in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:dispersive_coupling)(b).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDispersive coupling between a transmon and a superconducting resonator.

(d), (e) Two examples of physical realizations of a transmon device dispersively coupled to a superconducting cavity in either the planar (d) and 3D configuration (e).\n\nThe detailed theoretical description of the JJ and its underlying physics can be found in Refs.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Here, we aim to provide a brief intuitive picture that follows the line of Josephson's original work [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Let us consider each side of the JJ as a superconducting island containing a certain number of Cooper pairs. The joint state of the junction is described by the difference in number of Cooper pairs $\\bn$, which is the same observable used in our treatment of the simple LC circuit. As Cooper pairs tunnel across the junction, $\\bn$ varies accordingly. Therefore, the Hamiltonian of a Josephson junction can intuitively be written in the charge basis as\n$$\n\n\\bH_J/\\hbar = -\\frac{E_J}{2}\\sum^{+\\infty}_{n=-\\infty}\\left(\\ket{n}\\bra{n+1} + \\ket{n+1}\\bra{n}\\right),\n\n$$\nwhere $E_J$ is the Josephson energy, which is traditionally expressed in units of frequency by dividing it by $\\hbar$. We identify that the two parts of $\\bH_J$, i.e. $\\sum^{+\\infty}_{n=-\\infty}\\ket{n+1}\\bra{n}$ and its Hermitian conjugate, are unitary operators that translate the charge by one unit up and down respectively. This translation can also be written in the conjugate basis as $e^{\\pm i\\bphi}$, similar to how a position translation is written in terms of the momentum operator. Therefore, the Josephson Hamiltonian in the flux basis can be expressed as\n$$\n\n\\bH_J/\\hbar = -E_J \\cos{\\bphi}.\n\n$$\nDeveloping the cosine potential to second order gives rise to a quadratic term that resembles an inductive energy as described in Eq.\u00a0<ref>. This is commonly referred to as the Josephson inductance $L_J = \\hbar^2/(4e^2 E_J)$. As we will show in the case of the transmon, this non-linear inductance affords us the ability to selectively address individual transitions in the system."}
{"prompt": "Explain the 'Discussion' section of the paper.", "completion": "We have provided detailed theoretical models of the cross-resonance gate via effective block-diagonal Hamiltonian techniques. For the idealized qubit model, analytic expressions for the Hamiltonian components using the principle of least action\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] were obtained. The only two non-zero components are a large Stark shift term on the control qubit from off-resonant driving as well as the $ZX$ term required for generating entanglement. For the realistic transmon model effective Hamiltonians were constructed via both a perturbative approach as well as the principle of least action. These two approaches agree well in the weak drive limit and predict non-zero Pauli coefficients of the form $A \\otimes B$ with $A \\in \\{I,Z\\}$, $B \\in \\{I,X,Z\\}$. The presence of extra Hamiltonian terms compared to those from the ideal qubit case implies higher levels play an important role to understand the precise error terms for implementing a two-qubit gate.\n\nIn the experiment of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] an $IY$ term was found to be present in contrast to what is predicted from our analysis with a single CR drive on the control transmon. We propose this discrepancy is a result of classical cross-talk between the two transmons and generalized the model to include this effect via an additional phase-shifted drive term on the target transmon. For a set of realistic model parameters we found good agreement between the theoretical results here and those of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] which implies classical cross-talk may be a significant issue in real systems. Understanding the cross-talk channels leading to drive terms on the target transmon is an important area of further research.\n\nVarious interesting questions remain as directions for future research. First, it is useful to understand whether the perturbative construction converges to that of the principle of least action. For the standard two-block Schrieffer-Wolff transformation the perturbative construction does converge to exact unitary rotation and ideally this property holds for the multi-block case as well. It will also be interesting to apply these methods to larger multi-qubit systems, especially in the context of finding points to avoid in frequency space when dealing with fixed-frequency transmons in a circuit-QED architecture. The results from a multi-qubit analysis will have an impact on future design considerations in superconducting circuit systems."}
{"prompt": "Explain the '## Stochastic noise' section of the paper.", "completion": "The second type of noise is stochastic noise, arising from random fluctuations of parameters that are coupled to our qubit\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For example, thermal noise of a 50$\\Omega$ resistor in the control lines leading to the qubit will have voltage and current fluctuations \u2013 Johnson noise \u2013 with a noise power that is proportional to both temperature and bandwidth. Or, the oscillator that provides the carrier for a qubit control pulse may have amplitude or phase fluctuations. Additionally, randomly fluctuating electric and magnetic fields in the local qubit environment \u2013 e.g., on the metal surface, on the substrate surface, at the metal-substrate interface, or inside the substrate \u2013 can couple to the qubit. This creates unknown and uncontrolled fluctuations of one or more qubit parameters, and this leads to qubit decoherence.\n\nNoise strength and qubit susceptibility\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nTransverse and longitudinal noise represented on the Bloch sphere.\n\n(a) Bloch sphere representation of the quantum state $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle = \\alpha \\lvert 0 \\rangle + \\beta \\lvert 1 \\rangle$. The qubit quantization axis \u2013 the $z$ axis \u2013 is longitudinal in the qubit frame, corresponding to $\\sigma_z$ terms in the qubit Hamiltonian. The $x$-$y$ plane\n\nis transverse in the qubit frame, corresponding to $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$ terms in the qubit Hamiltonian.\n\n(b) Longitudinal relaxation results from energy exchange between the qubit and its environment, due to transverse noise that couples to the qubit in the $x-y$ plane and drives transitions $\\lvert 0 \\rangle \\leftrightarrow \\lvert 1\\rangle$. A qubit in state $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ emits energy to the environment and relaxes to $\\lvert 0\\rangle$ with a rate $\\Gamma_{1\\downarrow}$ (blue arched arrow). Similarly, a qubit in state $\\lvert 0\\rangle$ absorbs energy from the environment, exciting it to $\\lvert 1\\rangle$ with a rate $\\Gamma_{1\\uparrow}$ (orange arched arrow). In the typical operating regime $k_{\\mathrm{B}} T \\ll \\hbar \\freq$, the up-rate is suppressed, leading to the overall decay rate $\\Gamma_1 \\approx \\Gamma_{1\\downarrow}$.\n\n(c) Pure dephasing in the transverse plane arises from longitudinal noise along the $z$ axis that\n\nfluctuates the qubit frequency. A Bloch vector along the $x$-axis will diffuse clockwise or counterclockwise around the equator due to the stochastic frequency fluctuations, depolarizing the azimuthal phase with a rate $\\Gamma_{\\phi}$.\n\n(d) Transverse relaxation results in a loss of coherence at a rate $\\Gamma_2 = \\Gamma_1/2 + \\Gamma_{\\phi}$, due to a combination of energy relaxation and pure dephasing. Pure dephasing leads to decoherence of the quantum state $(1/\\sqrt{2})(\\lvert 0 \\rangle + \\lvert 1 \\rangle)$, initially pointed along the $x$-axis. Additionally, the excited state component of the superposition state  may relax to the ground state, a phase-breaking process that loses the orientation of the vector in the $x$-$y$ plane.\n\nThe degree to which a qubit is affected by noise is related to the amount of noise impinging on the qubit, and the qubit's susceptibility to that noise. The former is often a question of materials science and fabrication; that is, can we make devices with lower levels of noise. Or, it may be related to the quality of the control electronics and cryogenic engineering to limit the levels of noise on the control lines that necessarily connect to the qubits to control them. The latter \u2013 qubit susceptibility \u2013 is a question of qubit design. Qubits can be designed to trade off sensitivity to one type of noise at the expense of increased sensitivity to other types of noise. Thus, materials science, fabrication engineering, electronics design, cryogenic engineering, and qubit design all play a role in creating devices with high coherence. In general, one should strive to eliminate the sources of noise, and then design qubits that are insensitive to the residual noise.\n\nThe qubit response to noise depends on how the noise couples to it \u2013 either through a longitudinal or a transverse coupling as referenced to the qubit quantization axis. This can be visualized using a Bloch Sphere picture of the qubit state, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Bloch-sphere-noise) and discussed in detail in Section\u00a0<ref>.\n\nModeling noise and decoherence"}

{"prompt": "Explain the 'Correcting Errors with VZ-Gates' section of the paper.", "completion": "Beyond their direct use in quantum circuits, VZ-gates can correct for certain pulse errors that occur during physical one and two-qubit gates without introducing new errors. For example, a VZ-gate can correct a phase error, i.e. an unwanted Z-gate, by applying the inverse Z-gate. VZ-gates can also correct most off-resonance-rotation (ORR) errors. The unitary operator due to an ORR along the $X$ axis is,\n$$\n\nU_1 & = & e^{-it  \\left[\\frac{\\Omega}{2}\\hat{\\sigma}_X + \\Delta \\hat{\\sigma}_Z \\right]}, \\\\\nU_1 & = & e^{-i\\frac{\\Omega_R t}{2} \\left[\\cos(\\lambda)\\hat{\\sigma}_X + \\sin(\\lambda)\\hat{\\sigma}_Z \\right]}, \\label{eqn:rot_err_u1}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\tan(\\lambda)=\\frac{\\Delta}{\\Omega}$ and $\\Omega_R=\\sqrt{\\Omega^2+\\Delta^2}$. If the goal is to implement the gate $X_{\\theta}$, then the question is whether there is a Z correction that can be applied to Eqn.\u00a0<ref>, i.e., is there a $\\xi$ and $\\Omega_R$ such that\n$$\n\nX_{\\theta} = Z_{\\xi} \\cdot U_1(\\Omega_R t,\\lambda) \\cdot Z_{\\xi}? \\label{eqn:rot_err_u2}\n\n$$\nIf we expand Eqn.\u00a0(<ref>) then we get the following relations,\n$$\n\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\Omega_R t}{2}\\right) & = & \\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)}{\\cos(\\lambda)}, \\label{eqn:omega}\\\\\n\\tan(\\xi) & = & \\sin(\\lambda) \\tan\\left(\\frac{\\Omega_R t}{2}\\right), \\label{eqn:xi}\n\n$$\nand so there is a valid correction for the ORR error when $\\frac{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)}{\\cos(\\lambda)}\\le1$. For example, if  $\\lambda=0.1$, and the desired gate is $X_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ then $\\xi \\approx 0.1$ and $\\Omega_R t= \\pi/2+0.1^2$. Graphically, an exagerrated ORR for $X_{\\pi/2}$ is illustrated on the Bloch sphere in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:2a). Starting from $|0\\rangle$ the rotation is off-axis and so the final state is not along the $Y$ axis. However, a rotation angle exists so that the state still crosses the $XY$ plane and then a final VZ-gate corrects the angle error. Physically there is no solution when the rotation is sufficiently off-resonance such that it cannot pass through the plane defined by the desired final state. For example, a detuned $\\pi$ pulse cannot be compensated since a qubit starting in state $|0\\rangle$ does not complete the rotation to $|1\\rangle$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color Online) (a) Bloch-sphere representation of an attempted $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ rotation around the $X$ axis starting in the state $|0\\rangle$ on-resonance (red/light gray) and with a detuned drive (blue/dark gray). For a suitably compensated rotation angle the detuned drive ends up in the $XY$ place, but with a finite Z-rotation error. (b) Correcting the error using a VZ-gate, i.e., axes rotation.\n\nCorrecting ORR errors is of practical importance for weakly anharmonic transmon qubits. When resonantly driving the $|0\\rangle$ to $|1\\rangle$ transition, the drive frequency is only slightly detuned from the higher level transitions such as $|1\\rangle$ to $|2\\rangle$, and so there is a strong Stark effect which shifts the frequency of the $|1\\rangle$ state during the drive. The strength of the Stark shift is inversely proportional to the detuning, and thus ORR errors increase for short gates because of Fourier broadening of the drive frequency. The standard approach to correct these errors is to utilize DRAG pulse shaping, Eqn.\u00a0(<ref>), as we did for the RB data in \u00a0<ref>. Here we show similar performance using Gaussian pulses with VZ-gates used to correct ORR errors in the form given by Eqn.\u00a0(<ref>); we refer to the combined pulse as Gaussian plus Z (GZ). In Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:2) we plot the error per gate (EPG) from $XY_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ RB for DRAG, GZ and Gaussian pulses versus the sideband frequency of the pulse. Interestingly, the EPG for the Gaussian pulse is a strong function of the sideband frequency. This can be understood to be the result of the internal filtering of the AWG. In the rotating frame of the qubit the effect of this filter on the pulse shape is similar to the DRAG pulse shape. The value and sign of $\\beta$ is a function of the sideband frequency and so for certain frequencies the pulse shape exacerbates the ORR error. When we apply the Z gate correction the calibrated phase compensates for any passive DRAG shaping. From this data we conclude that GZ pulses are a viable alternative to DRAG when optimizing pulse fidelity. GZ pulses are not sensitive to the exact shape of the pulse and, as we will discuss next, permit the utilization of pulse shaping to address different errors such as leakage.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color Online) (a) EPG for the $XY_{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$ set (see main text) for three different pulse implementations: Gaussian, DRAG and Gaussian plus VZ-gate (GZ) as a function of the sideband frequency.

{"prompt": "Explain the 'Purcell rate with microwave drive and bandpass filter' section of the paper.", "completion": "The Purcell rate may decrease when the measurement microwave drive is added [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. A simple physical reason is the ac Stark shift, which in the typical setup increases the absolute value of detuning between the qubit and readout resonator with increasing number of photons in the resonator, thus reducing the Purcell rate. However, this explanation may not necessarily work well quantitatively.\n\nThe Purcell rate suppression due to the microwave drive was analyzed\nin Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for the case without the Purcell filter and\nusing the two-level approximation for the qubit. It was shown that\nin this case the suppression factor $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})/\\Gamma (0)$ is\napproximately $[(1+\\bar{n}/n_{\\rm crit})^{-1/2}+(1+\\bar{n}/n_{\\rm\ncrit})^{-1}]^2$ instead of the factor $(1+\\bar{n}/n_{\\rm\ncrit})^{-1}$ expected from the ac Stark shift, where $\\bar{n}$ is\nthe mean number of photons in the resonator and $n_{\\rm crit}\\equiv\n(\\Delta_{\\rm rq}/2g)^2$. This difference results in the ratio $3/2$\nbetween the corresponding slopes of $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})$ at small\n$\\bar{n}$, with the ac Stark shift model underestimating the Purcell\nrate suppression (see the blue lines in Fig. (Figure: Purcell relaxation time versus qubit-resonator detuning  for g/2\u03c0=86MHz)). However, when the third level of the qubit is taken into account, then the ac Stark shift model describes correctly the slope of $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})$ at small $\\bar{n}$  when the qubit anharmonicity is relatively small, $|\\delta_{\\rm q}/\\Delta_{\\rm rq}| \\ll 1$ (see Appendix).

The parameters used in the simulations are given in the text.\n\nTo check the accuracy of this formula numerically, we need to add into the Hamiltonian (<ref>) the terms describing the drive and higher levels in the qubit (see Appendix). However, the resulting Hilbert space was too large for our numerical simulations, so we numerically calculated $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})$ using only the two-level approximation for the qubit. Using the rotating frame based on the drive frequency $\\omega_{\\rm d}$ [i.e., $H_0=\\omega_{\\rm d}(\\sigma_+\\sigma_- +a^\\dagger a+ b^\\dagger b)$], we then obtain the interaction Hamiltonian\n$$\n\\label{h}\nV_{\\rm d}&=\\Delta_{\\rm rd}a^{\\dag}a+\\Delta_{\\rm fd}b^{\\dag}b+ \\Delta_{\\rm qd} \\sigma_+\\sigma_- +\\textit{g}(a^{\\dag}\\sigma_{-}+a\\sigma_{+})\\notag\\\\\n&+\\mathcal{G}a^{\\dag}b+ \\mathcal{G}^*ab^{\\dag} +\\varepsilon_{\\rm r} a^{\\dag}\n+ \\varepsilon_{\\rm r}^* a,\n\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_{\\rm rd}=\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}-\\omega_{\\rm d}$,  $\\Delta_{\\rm fd}=\\omega_{\\rm f}-\\omega_{\\rm d}$, $\\Delta_{\\rm qd}=\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-\\omega_{\\rm d}$, and for simplicity we assumed that the drive $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$\nis applied to the readout resonator. (For the rotating wave approximation we also need to assume that $|\\Delta_{\\rm rd}|$, $|\\Delta_{\\rm fd}|$, $|\\Delta_{\\rm qd}|$, $|g|$, $|\\mathcal{G}|$, and $|\\dot{\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}}/\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}|$ are all small compared with $\\omega_{\\rm d}$.)

As the initial state we use the excited state for\nthe qubit and vacuum for the two resonators, $|\\psi\\rangle_{\\rm\nin}=|e00\\rangle$. The Purcell rate is extracted from the numerical\nsolution of $\\rho_{ee}(t)$ by fitting $-\\ln[\\rho_{ee}(t)]$ with a\nlinear function in the long time limit (still requiring $1-\\rho_{ee}(t)\\ll 1$). In the simulations we pump\nthe readout resonator with the frequency $\\omega_{\\rm d}=\\omega_{\\rm\nr}^{|e\\rangle}$ and control $\\bar{n}$ by\nchoosing the corresponding value of $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$. The value of $\\bar{n}$ is calculated numerically; it is close to what is expected from the solution of the classical field equations when the $n$-dependence of $\\chi$ and $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}$ is taken into account: in the two-level approximation $\\chi({\\bar n})=-g^2/[\\Delta_{\\rm rq}\\sqrt{1+4g^2{\\bar n}/\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^2}]$ and $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}=\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}+\\chi ({\\bar n})$. Since $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}$ changes with $\\bar n$, we change $\\omega_{\\rm d}$ accordingly.\n\nThe red solid line in Fig.  (Figure: Purcell relaxation time versus qubit-resonator detuning  for g/2\u03c0=86MHz) shows the numerical results for the Purcell rate suppression factor $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})/\\Gamma (0)$ as a function of $\\bar n=\\bar{n}^{|e\\rangle}$, normalized by $|\\Delta_{\\rm rq}/\\chi(0)|$. Note that in the two-level approximation (which we used in the simulations) ${\\bar n}/|\\Delta_{\\rm rq}/\\chi(0)|={\\bar n}/4n_{\\rm crit}$. In the simulations we have used $g/2\\pi=100\\,$MHz, $\\kappa_{\\rm r}^{-1}=36\\,$ns, $\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{-1}=0.71\\,$ns, $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}/2\\pi=\\omega_{\\rm f}/2\\pi=6.8\\,$GHz,\nand $\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}/2\\pi=6\\,$GHz. The blue solid line shows the numerical suppression factor for the standard setup [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (without the filter resonator), also in the two-level approximation for the qubit. We see a larger suppression for the case with the filter, as expected from\nthe ac Stark shift interpretation and the fact that $\\Gamma \\propto \\Delta_{\\rm rq}^{-4}$ with the filter, while $\\Gamma \\propto \\Delta_{\\rm rq}^{-2}$ in the standard setup.\nHowever, comparison with the prediction of the ac Stark shift model (dashed lines) does not show a quantitative agreement. There is about 10\n\nNote that the numerical calculations have been made using only the two-level model for the qubit. It is possible that the agreement between the ac Stark shift model and the numerical results is much better if three or more levels in the qubit are taken into account. This is an interesting question for further research.\n\nAlso note that in experiments, increase of the drive power often leads to decrease of the qubit lifetime, instead of the increase, predicted by our analysis (both with and without the filter). The reason for this effect is not quite clear and may be related to various technical issues. Therefore, either suppression or enhancement of the qubit relaxation with the drive power may be observed in actual experiments."}

Gate fidelities with a fixed 100ns pulse width as a function of the coupler flux for Device A a and Device B b. The drive frequency is plotted in gray, represented on the right axis. All points missing from the full set of 21 correspond to more severe calibration failures.\n\nThe most common reason for low-performance operation points was nearby unwanted transitions, leading to a high amount of leakage. This is most evident in Device A, in which the\u00a0$\\ket{101}\\leftrightarrow\\ket{111}$ transition at\u00a0$\\Phi_\\text{ext,c} = \\SI{1.0}{\\Phi_0}$, and the\u00a0$\\ket{101}\\leftrightarrow\\ket{102}$ transition at\u00a0$\\Phi_\\text{ext,c} = \\SI{0.5}{\\Phi_0}$ are furthest detuned from their nearest unwanted transition, resulting in higher fidelities in these regions. Where these unwanted transitions have a much smaller detuning, we expect to obtain higher fidelities by increasing the drive pulse beyond 100ns. In other regions, we expect higher fidelities by decreasing the gate time.\n\nA second common mechanism for failed calibration was the inability to find a drive frequency corresponding to a\u00a0$180^\\circ$ conditional phase shift. Due to the large hybridization, we occasionally measured ac-Stark shifts large enough to counter-balance the natural change in the conditional-phase angle as a function of drive detuning. The calibration could be recovered by either using a slower gate or by adjusting the relative drive amplitudes to tweak the total ac-stark shift.\n\nOther less common mechanisms for a failed calibration include TLSs or accidental resonances with undesired transitions, including higher-photon transitions.\n\nfig:sup_coherence_vs_flux_D1 shows the individual qubit coherence times as a function of the local coupler flux in Device A. Each coherence time was simultaneously measured on each qubit, with both qubits precisely re-tuned to\u00a0$\\Phi_\\text{ext} = \\SI{0.5}{\\Phi_0}$ for each value of the coupler flux. Notably, these coherence times are slightly shorter than those listed in tab:hamiltonian, due to bias-induced heating of the local flux lines. However, these coherence times are a more accurate representation of the quality of the qubits when performing two-qubit gates and simultaneous single-qubit gates.\nWhen performing simultaneous single-qubit gates, we biased the coupler at roughly\u00a0$\\Phi_\\text{ext,c} = \\SI{0.77}{\\Phi_0}$, corresponding to no current being sent through the coupler flux line. We suspect the low Ramsey time of qubit 2 to be caused by Aharonov-Casher dephasing from coherent quantum phase slips\u00a0[Di Paolo, Agustin, Baker, Thomas E, Foley, Alexandre, S\u00e9n\u00e9chal, David, Blais, Alexandre, \"Efficient modeling of superconducting quantum circuits with tensor networks\", 2021] [Mizel, Ari, Yanay, Yariv, \"Right-sizing fluxonium against charge noise\", 2020], based on its Hamiltonian parameters.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nQubit coherences in Device A with both qubits biased at 0.5\u03a6_0.

The solid lines, coinciding with the marks, are the corresponding analytical predictions by Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).

Other parameters are $A=0.02$ and $J=100$. The average is performed over $N_r = 10^3$ random $w$'s distributed uniformly between $[0,1]$.\nWhen $\\tau=\\pi/h$, the spin average barely decay under REs and Hahn echoes, indicating strong suppression of stray magnetic fields.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color online) Dependence of the spin average on $t=4N\\tau$ and $h\\tau$. The parameters are $J=1$, $h=20$, and $A=0.02$. The spin average is conserved if $h\\tau=m\\pi \\; (m=1, 2, 3, \\cdots)$ as shown by horizontal dashed lines.\n\nWe consider an initial coherent spin state which is fully polarized along $y$ axis and evolves under the total Hamiltonian Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). We assume the stray magnetic-field effect as white noise, i.e., a series of random numbers ranging from 0 to $w_c$. We set the energy unit as $w_c=1$ and the corresponding time unit is $w_c^{-1}=1$. Other terms with $A$ and $h$ are all scaled with $w_c$. For a typical spin-1 BEC experiment, such as $^{87}$Rb, the stray magnetic fields are in the order of $1$ mG, i.e., roughly 3 kHz in energy. For a magnetic shield room with permalloy plates, the stray field can be further reduced down to $0.1$ mG\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe free evolution of the system, i.e., the free induction decay (FID), is often manifested by the decay of the transverse magnetization or the spin average\n$$\n~\\label{eq:sa}\n\\langle J_y\\rangle (t) &=& \\langle \\psi(t) | J_y |\\psi(t) \\rangle\n\n$$\nwhere $\\psi(t)$ is the wave function of the condensate spin at time $t$. In the stray magnetic fields, the condensate spin only precesses around $z$ axis and is dephased with a characteristic time $T^*_2$. It is easy to find the FID signal\n$$\n~\\label{eq:sa}\n\\langle J_y\\rangle (t) &=& J\\;\\frac {\\sin(w_c t)} {w_c t} \\nonumber\n\n$$\nand the dephasing time is in the order of $T_2^* \\sim w_c^{-1}$, as also shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:expv).\n\nBy including the driving field $h$, the dephasing due to the stray magnetic field is suppressed by the REs, i.e., the spin average is larger than the FID signal. It is straightforward to calculate the spin average for a given $w$ at $t=4N\\tau$\n$$\n\n\\langle J_y\\rangle(t)=J\\cos{(\\sqrt{\\lambda^2+\\gamma^2}\\,)}, \\nonumber\n\n$$\nwhere we have adopted the $N$-cycle evolution operator in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).

Since each stray magnetic field frequency $w_i$ is untrackable, we consider the strong driving regime, $h\\gg w_c$, which is often the case in a practical precision measurement experiment. Hence, when $h\\tau=m\\pi$, $\\langle J_y(t)\\rangle$ barely decay.\n\nTo check the validity regime for $h\\gg w_c$, we carry out numerical calculations and present both analytical and numerical results in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:expv). For the parameters we choose ($g \\lesssim 0.05$, where $g=w_c/h$), the analytical and numerical results agree well. As shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:expv), the RE sequence always suppresses the stray magnetic-field effect and improves the spin average, no matter what value of $\\tau$ is. As $\\tau$ increases from a small value, the performance of the RE protocol becomes better, i.e., the spin average at a fixed time becomes larger. In particular, the spin average is almost a constant if the magic condition $\\tau = \\pi /h $ is satisfied [see also Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:echo)(a)]. We remark that such a magic $\\tau$ exists simultaneously for all $w_i$, instead of a single one. Once $\\tau > \\pi/h$, the spin average drops with $\\tau$ increasing. In addition, our numerical results for $J=10$ and $J=100$ agree exactly, indicating that the performance of the RE protocol is independent of the spin size $J$. Finally, we compare the evolution of spin average under the magic REs and Hahn echoes with the same cycle period $4\\tau = 0.2\\pi$. The pulse amplitude and width of the Hahn echoes are, respectively, $10h=200$ and $0.1\\tau=0.005\\pi$. The performance of the magic RE protocol is essentially the same as that of the Hahn echo.\n\nTo investigate the effect of various $\\tau$, we further calculate the spin average under RE sequences for different $\\tau$s and present the results in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:ttau). We see clear periodicity of $\\tau = m\\pi/h$ where the spin average is almost conserved, from Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:ttau). In addition, the good performance region, where the spin average is close to $J$ (red region in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:ttau)), becomes larger as $m$ increases."}

{"prompt": "Explain the 'Conclusion' section of the paper.", "completion": "Our setup for superconducting qubit control and measurement was designed with the following goals in mind: to be scalable, to minimise the number of microwave components/instruments to be managed and calibrated, and to have remote access capabilities for the experimenter.\nTo these ends, we opted for the Xilinx RFSoC device with sixteen channels of DAC and ADC with high sampling rate to support direct generation and detection of microwave signals at 5\u20138\u00a0GHz. The approach avoids using physical IQ mixers and eliminates the periodic calibration associated with the mixers.\nWe also designed a circuit that synchronised several RFSoC boards together using a master clock and triggers for the DAC and ADC channels.\nA low-noise DC source was also developed to tune the qubit based on Ref.\u00a0[Yang,Yu-Meng , Xie,Hong-Tai , Ji,Wen-Chao , Wang,Yue-Fei , Zhang,Wei-Yong , Chen,Shuai , Jiang,Xiao , \"Ultra-low noise and high bandwidth bipolar current driver for precise magnetic field control\", 2019].\nThe remote access to the experiment was implemented with an API to a database on a server, where the user can submit abstracted experimental parameters and retrieve the results.\n\nIn the near-term future, a few enhancements to the capabilities are being considered.\nIn particular, the use of more features on the RFSoC device such as the utilising the on-board mixer as an alternative waveform generation and sampling method.\nAt the moment, the readout signals are processed by the master PC, which can be an issue when dealing with a significantly larger number of qubits. To distribute the data processing load, a future consideration is to use the DSP slices on every RFSoC to process its respective ADC data.\nBy combining the feedback control feature and the DSP slices as a fast readout system, it may be possible to signal the switching trigger to activate and the correction pulses can be sent to the appropriate channels according to the qubit state\u00a0[Salath\u00e9, Yves, Kurpiers, Philipp, Karg, Thomas, Lang, Christian, Andersen, Christian Kraglund, Akin, Abdulkadir, Krinner, Sebastian, Eichler, Christopher, Wallraff, Andreas, \"Low-Latency Digital Signal Processing for Feedback and Feedforward in Quantum Computing and Communication\", 2018].\nThe current setup has a relatively low duty cycle for the experiments, which is mostly due to the output data file generation and transferring it out of the RFSoC to the master PC. Improving the experiment duty cycle is currently a work in progress.\nAdditionally, to further support larger number of samples, we will work on memory optimisation and will also consider faster DDR RAMs (such as QUAD channel RAMs) for direct streaming to/from the channels.\n\nWith all of the important features integrated into a single chip, one can consider the idea of migrating the RFSoC device from room temperature into the dilution refrigerator\u00a0[Pauka, SJ, Das, K, Kalra, R, Moini, A, Yang, Y, Trainer, M, Bousquet, A, Cantaloube, C, Dick, N, Gardner, GC, others, \"A cryogenic CMOS chip for generating control signals for multiple qubits\", 2021] for improved SNR and fewer connections to room temperature electronics.\nThis would provide an alternative implementation of cryogenic control electronics based on commercially available devices, in contrast to other possible technologies such as Josephson arbitrary waveform synthesizer\u00a0[Sirois, Adam J., Castellanos-Beltran, Manuel, Fox, Anna E., Benz, Samuel P., Hopkins, Peter F., \"Josephson Microwave Sources Applied to Quantum Information Systems\", 2020] or single-flux technology (SFQ) pulse drivers\u00a0[Leonard, E., Beck, M.

While the current implementation for superconducting qubits does not yield an advantage over classical factorization algorithms, this algorithm can be used to demonstrate qubit control.\n\nUsing the $\\pi$-pulse and $\\pi/2$-pulse from the earlier sections, we apply the factorization algorithm (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:fig1)) using the ICARUS-Q RFSoC for $N=263193$ and $M=15$.\n\nWe inspect the discernability $\\mathcal{D}$ between factors and non-factors. The greater the value of $\\mathcal{D}$, the easier it is to identify actual factors over non-factors. $\\mathcal{D}$ is determined by the difference between the probabilities for the worst performing factor and the non-factor closest to 1. In an earlier work\u00a0[Zaw, LH, Tan, YP, Nguyen, Lh, Budoyo, RP, Park, Kh, Koh, Zy, Landra, A, Hufnagel, C, Yap, YS, Koh, TS, Dumke, R, \"Ghost factors in Gauss-sum factorization with transmon qubits\", 2021], we have calculated the upper limit of $\\mathcal{D}$ as $0.67$. In this experiment, we have obtained a value of $\\mathcal{D}$ as 0.195 (see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:fig2)) compared to the previously reported experimental value of 0.4. The difference between these two experiments are the qubits and the number of measurements per data point, which causes the different discernibility. Hence, we have successfully demonstrated the execution of the factorization algorithm on the ICARUS-Q platform.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nPulse sequence for Gauss sum factorization. A $\\pi/2$-pulse phase shifted by $\\pi/2$ is used to rotate the qubit to the superposition state. Next, a train of $m$ $\\pi$ pulses is applied to the qubit. The phase of the first $\\pi$-pulse is 0 and the $k$-th pulse is $(-1)^k\\pi(2k-1)N/l$ where $N$ is the number to factorize and $l$ is the trial factor. Finally, a $\\pi/2$-pulse phase shifted by $\\pi/2$ is used to rotate the system back to the computational basis. If $l$ is a factor of $N$, the phase will be an integer number of $\\pi$ and the $\\pi$-pulse train will be in phase, causing the final $\\pi/2$ rotation to rotate the system to $\\ket{1}$. Otherwise, an arbitrary rotation of the system will occur. The sequence is repeated for $m$ in 1 to $M$, where $M$ is the total number of pulses to be used and the results are averaged by $M$. This is to reduce the impact of arbitrary non-factor rotations that may end up near $\\ket{1}$. A delay $\\tau$ is applied between pulses.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nExcited state probability for each trial factors up to 200 in the factorization of $263193$. We apply the preprocessing technique in \u00a0[Zaw, LH, Tan, YP, Nguyen, Lh, Budoyo, RP, Park, Kh, Koh, Zy, Landra, A, Hufnagel, C, Yap, YS, Koh, TS, Dumke, R, \"Ghost factors in Gauss-sum factorization with transmon qubits\", 2021] to skip over multiples of $2$ and $5$ as they provide bad contrast compared to the actual factors. The expected factors in this regime are $3, 7, 21, 83, 151$ (highlighted in red). We can see that the major peaks near 1 correspond to the factors, allowing us to identify factors and composite factors. The lowest excited state probability for the factors is 0.834 while the highest excited state probability of the non-factors is 0.639 at $l=27$. The behaviour of this non-factor is discussed in more detail in Ref.\u00a0[Zaw, LH, Tan, YP, Nguyen, Lh, Budoyo, RP, Park, Kh, Koh, Zy, Landra, A, Hufnagel, C, Yap, YS, Koh, TS, Dumke, R, \"Ghost factors in Gauss-sum factorization with transmon qubits\", 2021]."}

{"prompt": "Explain the '## Isolated superconducting resonators' section of the paper.", "completion": "We often model an isolated LC oscillator as a lumped-element system consisting of an inductor $L$ and a capacitor $C$, as shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:oscillator)(a). However, these notions can be extended beyond lumped element circuits. More generally, the inductive energy stems from charges moving in a conductor and creating a magnetic field which tends to oppose any changes in current. The capacitive energy, on the other hand, arises from the electrostatic energy between two regions of a superconductor that contain different number of charges. A superconducting resonator is simply a collection of such quantum LC oscillators, with each mode of the resonator corresponding to a single oscillator with a well-defined resonance frequency.\n\nWe can capture the dynamics of superconducting resonators with two dimensionless quantities. The first one, $\\bphi$, is a result of the quantization of the magnetic flux threaded through the inductor. The total magnetic flux observable is then $\\boldsymbol{\\phi} = \\phi_0\\,\\bphi$, where $\\phi_0 = \\hbar/2e$ is the reduced magnetic flux quantum. The second one, $\\bn$, is the difference in the number of charges on the two plates of the capacitor in units $2e$, which correspond to the charge of a Cooper pair. It is related to the total charge observable, which is given by $\\bn_Q = 2e\\bn$. Whlie valuable insight is gained from this lumped-element model, microwave resonators are generally implemented using distributed elements in practice. For such systems, $\\bn$ relates to the quantization of the electric energy, caused by an unbalanced charge distribution across different parts of the structure (see Fig.\u00a03(d)).

The situation is reversed when the impedance is low relative to the flux quantum."}

{"prompt": "Explain the 'Fitting and Analyzing Simulations and Data' section of the paper.", "completion": "To test the $\\phi$RM and the DCM, we simulate the transmission using a numerical linear solver. Simulations are run varying several different parameters: $Q_i$, impedance mismatches, strength of both inductive and capacitive coupling and inductance of $L_1$. The resonator capacitance and inductance are held at 0.3 pF and 2.5 nH, respectively, producing a resonance frequency that ranges from 5.717-5.802 GHz (resonance frequency varies with coupling capacitance). The simulated data is then fit and analyzed using both methods.\n\nWe created asymmetry by varying $Z_{in}/Z_{out}$. Note that asymmetry can also be created by increasing $L_1$. However, $L_1$ values in the nanohenries are required to create significant asymmetry which is far too large to be physical. Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:lorent) shows results from simulations and fits with the same simulated quality factor, $Q_i=10^5$ and a range of $Z_{in}/Z_{out}$ values. The coupling line mismatch creates a clear asymmetry in the line shape which is quantified  with the extracted asymmetry angle, $\\phi$, also shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:lorent). In addition to the value of $\\phi$ extracted from the fit, we also analytically determine the asymmetry using\n$$\n\n\\phi=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{Im}\\{G_D\\}}{R_T^{-1}}\\right).\n\\label{eq:phi}\n\n$$\n\nTwo internal quality factors are extracted from these fits, one using the $\\phi$RM and the other using the DCM. In  Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_phi) both extracted quality factors as well as the fit extracted asymmetry angle $\\phi$ are plotted against the predicted $\\phi$ from Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). It is clear from Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_phi) that the DCM is more accurate as the asymmetry, $\\phi$, increases, and that the two methods agree  for small asymmetry.\n\nWe also compared both analysis techniques when asymmetry is held constant but $Q_i$ is varied, which we will show later corresponds to some experimental data sets. Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_sim) shows the fit extracted $Q_i$ from both analysis techniques as the actual simulation $Q_i$ is increased for two sets of simulations, one with low and one with high asymmetry. For low asymmetry (matched ports) both analysis techniques yield the correct $Q_i$ within the expected first-order error ($C_C/C$). However, for high asymmetry (mismatched ports), the $\\phi$RM yields quality factors that are systematically too high. For sufficiently high $Q_i$s, the $\\phi$RM yields negative $Q_i$s (this is why the asymmetric data analyzed by the $\\phi$RM appears to stop at large $Q_i$ in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_sim)). These unphysical, negative, $Q_i$s can best be understood by examining the circle plots in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle). As discussed earlier when there is a large asymmetry, in addition to being rotated, the resonance circle grows by a factor of $1/\\cos(\\phi)$ (assuming full transmission off resonance). Since the $\\phi$RM only rotates the circle back, it does not account for the increase in size, shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(b). So if $Q \\approx Q_e$ $(Q_i>>Q_e)$, the circle diameter is larger than 1, almost crossing the y-axis. Rotating the circle using the $\\phi$RM causes the circle to cross the y-axis and this yields a negative $Q_i$. In Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(b) the $\\phi$RM analyzed simulation almost crosses the origin. This corresponds to the $Q_i=8 \\times 10^5$ simulation in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_sim); it is an example of a simulation data set with a $Q_i$ and asymmetry not large enough to create a negative $Q_i$ but still large enough to create a considerable discrepancy between $Q_{i,\\ \\phi RM}$ and $Q_{i,\\ DCM}$.\n\nTo further evaluate both methods, we also analyzed data from a 5.75GHz coplanar aluminum resonator on sapphire, measured at 30 mK in a dilution refrigerator. Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:res)(a) shows a picture of this resonator and a more detailed description can be found in Ref.\u00a0Khalil2011. The resonator is measured by being mounted in a copper sample box and electrical connections are made with the Coplanar waveguide (CPW) using aluminum wire bonds. Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:res)(b) shows an example of the measured resonance line shape and its fit for one mounting of the resonator which exhibited a particularly high asymmetry, presumably due to the non-ideal mounting of the device in the sample box. In Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_data) we show the extracted $Q_i$ using both techniques and the extracted asymmetry angle, $\\phi$. The quality factor dependence on voltage is discussed in Ref.\u00a0Khalil2011. Here we focus on the difference between the two analysis techniques. Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_data) is very similar to the high asymmetry simulations in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_sim).  As expected from Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), the asymmetry, $\\phi$, is independent of $Q_i$ for both the real device measurements and the simulated data. Also the last two data points for the $\\phi$RM in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_data) are negative (and off the plot) in the same manner that the last points in the simulated data of Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qi_sim) are negative.\n\nAn additional way to test the analysis techniques is by varying $Q_e$ while keeping $Q_i$ constant. In Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Qe), $Q_e$ is increased by lowering the capacitive coupling. As expected, for low asymmetry (matched ports) both analysis techniques do a good job of extracting $Q_i=10^5$. However, with high asymmetry (mismatched ports) the $\\phi$RM overestimates $Q_i$ by a decreasing amount as $Q_e/Q_i$ increases. Interestingly, in the $\\phi$RM, as $Q_e$ increases, the extracted $Q_i$ approaches the real value, although the asymmetry, $\\phi$, is increasing. This is because as $Q_e$ increases the $\\phi$RM is less sensitive to the asymmetry. This behavior is captured in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), which shows that as $Q_e$ increases, the difference between the two analysis methods vanishes. In fact for $Q_e>>Q_i$, the asymmetry becomes completely irrelevant and the two techniques converge."}

Blue (green) circles with $X$ ($Z$) labels represent ancillas performing $X$-type ($Z$-type) quantum parity checks of their nearest-neighbor data qubits. Each check is realized as an indirect quantum measurement, consisting of a coherent step involving pairwise interactions (dashed lines) followed by ancilla measurement. The delineated fabric of nine data qubits ($\\Da$ through $\\Di$) and eight ancillas ($\\Xa$ through $\\Xd$ and $\\Za$ through $\\Zd$) constitutes the distance-3 planar logical qubit named Surface-17.\n\nA surface-code fabric consists of the two-dimensional square lattice of data-carrying qubits shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Large_SC). The stabilizers of this code are the $X$-type ($Z$-type) parity operators $\\prod_i X_i$ $\\left(\\prod_i Z_i \\right)$, where $i$ denotes data qubits on the corners of the blue (green) plaquettes. Conventionally, these stabilizers are measured indirectly using ancilla qubits positioned at the center of the plaquettes, forming a second square lattice. Standard circuits for measuring $X$- and $Z$-type stabilizers, shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Plaquettes), combine a sequence of coherent interactions of the ancilla with its nearest-neighbor data qubits, followed by projective ancilla measurement.\n\nUsing controlled-not ($\\CX$) gates as the fundamental interaction,  $X$-type and $Z$-type stabilizer measurements can be fully parallelized with circuit depth seven. We define circuit depth as the number of operations on each ancilla per QEC cycle, counting in measurement but excluding ancilla initialization [we assume Pauli frame updating (PFU)\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is used for data and ancilla qubits]. The order of two-qubit gates in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Plaquettes) is important for two reasons\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. First,\ndata qubits common to adjacent plaquettes must do all their interactions with one ancilla before the other. Second, the S (N) pattern for $X$-type ($Z$-type) stabilizers provides resilience to single ancilla-qubit errors even in small distance-three surface codes such as Surface-17. This circuit consists of the patch delineated in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Large_SC), with nine data qubits (labelled $\\Da$ to $\\Di$), four ancillas ($\\Xa$ to $\\Xd$) for $X$-type stabilizer measurements, and four ancillas\n($\\Za$ to $\\Zd$) for $Z$-type stabilizer measurements.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n$X$-type (a) and $Z$-type (b) plaquettes.

The order of two-qubit gates, NE-NW-SE-SW (NE-SE-NW-SW) for $X$-type ($Z$-type), ensures that all data qubits common to  adjacent plaquettes do their interactions with one ancilla before the other, and also provides resilience to ancilla errors in Surface-17\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Using the relations $H=Y_{+90}Z=ZY_{-90}$, one can see that the opening and closing $H$ gates can be replaced by $Y_{-90}$ and $Y_{+90}$ rotations, respectively.\n\nWhen the two-qubit gate is $\\CZ$, parallelizing the stabilizer measurements of Surface-17 requires depth nine because of non-commutation between Hadamard $(H)$ gates and $\\CZ$ gates. The full circuit for the parallelized QEC cycle of Surface-17 using $\\CZ$ gates is shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Parallelized). Using gate and measurement times from recent experiments  ($\\toneq=20~\\ns$ for single-qubit gates, $\\ttwoq=40~\\ns$ for $\\CZf$ gates, and $500~\\ns$ for ancilla readout and photon depletion in readout resonator), the QEC cycle will complete in $740~\\ns$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDepth-nine quantum circuit for parallelized $X$- and $Z$-stabilizer measurements in Surface-17 using $\\CZ$ gates.

Qubits are labelled as in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:Large_SC).\n\nLimitations of fully parallelized $X$- and $Z$-type stabilizer measurements using $\\CZf$ gates\n\nOn paper, it is straightforward to compose a depth-nine quantum circuit for the fully parallelized QEC cycle of a surface-code fabric of arbitrary size. However, to the best of our knowledge following numerous failed  attempts, the full parallelization of $X$- and $Z$-type stabilizer measurements makes it impossible to realize a scalable implementation with $\\CZf$ gates that satisfies all of the following desirable properties:\n\n* Microwave pulses for single-qubit gates should be applied at a fixed, small number of frequencies.\n\n* Transmons should maximally exploit their coherence sweetspot\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n* Flux-pulsed transmons should not cross any other interaction zones on their way to or from the intended\n$\\ket{11} \\leftrightarrow \\ket{02}$ avoided crossings realizing the $\\CZf$ gate.\n\n* The flux-pulsing schemes should be extensible to a surface code of arbitrary size using a fixed number of detuning sequences and a fixed detuning range.\n\n* The implementation should be compatible with logical qubit operations.\n\nWe have found frequency arrangements and flux-pulse sequences that meet the first three criteria.\nHowever, all of these solutions require a growing number of detuning sequences and detuning ranges as the fabric expands, in order to avert all other interactions on the way to and from the $\\ket{11} \\leftrightarrow \\ket{02}$ avoided crossings of $\\CZf$ gates. Furthermore, these solutions seem practically infeasible already for distance five (Surface-49\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]). To our knowledge, no fully parallel solution exists with a fixed number of detuning sequences and a fixed detuning range. In the next section, we introduce a pipelined (rather than parallelized) version of the QEC cycle that simultaneously meets the five desirable properties for a fabric of arbitrary size."}

When we apply a VZ-gate, the phase update to the single-qubit drive will affect subsequent two-qubit interactions; how to manage this issue is dependent on the specific implementation of that interaction.\n\nFor microwave-activated gates the phase update is straightforward. Here we will give two examples for the cross-resonance gate and the parametric iSWAP gate. The cross-resonance (CR) gate (see e.g. Ref\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]) interaction is the example considered in Eqn.\u00a0(<ref>). To turn on the CR interaction the $ZX$ term is modulated at $\\omega_2$ with a separate drive. The CR rotation angle is defined with respect to the the phase $\\phi_2$ as shown in Eqn.\u00a0(<ref>). When a VZ-gate is applied to qubit 2 the phase of the CR drive must be updated accordingly. For the iSWAP gate (see e.g. Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]), an $XX+YY$ term is activated by modulating at the difference frequency $\\omega_1-\\omega_2$. The phase of this iSWAP drive is matched to the difference of the single-qubit drive phases $\\phi_1-\\phi_2$. Therefore, the VZ-gate phase is applied to the iSWAP drive with a different sign for qubits 1 and 2.\n\nFor flux-tunable qubits, i.e., where the qubit frequencies are dynamically tuned to go to an interaction resonance, compatibility with the VZ-gate is more difficult. In these systems there are time dependent single-qubit $\\sigma_Z$ terms in Eqn.\u00a0(<ref>) which do not necessarily commute with the interaction. Therefore VZ-gates before the interaction necessitate also updating the $\\sigma_Z$ dynamics. However, if the interaction is $ZZ$ (see e.g. Refs\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]), then these single-qubit $Z$ terms commute through and can be compensated by a subsequent VZ-gate."}

Traditionally, non-classical correlations between entangled qubits are measured by counting coincidences between single-shot readouts of individual qubits. We report entanglement metrology using a single detection channel with direct access to ensemble-averaged correlations between two superconducting qubits. Following validation and calibration of this joint readout, we demonstrate full quantum tomography on both separable and highly-entangled two-qubit states produced on demand. Using a subset of the measurements required for full tomography, we perform entanglement metrology with $\\sim$$95\\%$ accuracy and $\\sim$$98\\%$ precision despite $\\sim$$10\\%$ fidelity of single measurements. For the highly entangled states, measured Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt operators reach a maximum value of $2.61\\pm 0.04$, and entanglement witnesses give a lower bound of $\\sim$$88\\%$ on concurrence. In its present form, this detector will be able to resolve future improvements in the production of two-qubit entanglement and is immediately extendable to 3 or 4 qubits.\n\nSince 1964, when Bell made testable [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] the famous paradox formulated by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] questioning non-locality in quantum mechanics, the measurement of correlations between quantum systems has been central to foundational tests against alternate theories. The once `spooky' non-classical correlations known as quantum entanglement have since been amply examined in experiments [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Recently, entanglement has gained prominence as a key resource for large-scale quantum computation, making today's quantum engineer less concerned with foundational issues, and more with the generation and detection of near-perfect entanglement between qubits.\n\nAll approaches to metrology of entanglement, such as quantum state tomography, entanglement witnesses and generalized Bell inequality violations [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], require experimental measurement of ensemble-averaged qubit-qubit correlations. The paradigm for such detection used in trapped-ion systems\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where single-shot qubit readouts with fidelities exceeding $99.99\\%$ have been realized [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], is to calculate correlations by measuring coincidences between individual detector `clicks' over many repetitions. In solid-state systems, however, measurement cross-talk and lower readout fidelities make the accurate and precise measurement of  correlations by this approach technically challenging, despite significant improvements in recent years\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Various approaches seeking direct access to  correlations with joint, or quadratic,  on-chip detectors have been theoretically proposed for mesoscopic systems  [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn this Report, we demonstrate entanglement metrology with a single measurement channel that performs a joint readout of two charge-based superconducting qubits. This readout is based on qubit-state dependent shifts of a microwave transmission-line resonator in a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. By  validating and calibrating the measurement model for this single-channel detector, we circumvent a low $\\sim$$10\\%$ single-shot detection fidelity and obtain ensemble-averaged correlations with $\\sim$$95\\%$ accuracy and $\\sim$$98\\%$ precision. While this joint readout has been previously used in superconducting qubit systems [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], we demonstrate for the first time its use to detect state-of-the-art highly-entangled states produced on demand, with fidelity to targeted Bell states $>$$90\\%$, a lower bound of $\\sim$$88\\%$ on concurrence, and violation of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequalities [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] with a value of $2.61\\pm 0.04$. Furthermore, we anticipate that future improvements in entanglement production with this architecture will be detectable with the joint readout in its present form.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nExperimental setup and readout. (A) Circuit diagram of experimental setup, representing the cavity as a lumped $L-C$ resonator. Microwave drive tones that address the cavity, $\\omega_{\\text{RF}}$, and qubits, $\\omega_\\text{d}^{\\text{L(R)}}$, are applied via the cavity input line. The left (right) qubit has charging energy $E_C^{\\text{L(R)}}$ and Josephson energy $E_J^{\\text{L(R)}}$ (flux $\\Phi^{\\text{L(R)}}$ tunable via $V^{\\text{L(R)}})$. The multiplexed qubit-state information is transmitted out on a single readout line, amplified through a high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifier at $4\\, \\text{K}$ and mixed down at room temperature for digital processing. (B-E) Color images of transmitted $\\VH$ amplitude as a function of time and cavity drive frequency $\\omega_{\\text{RF}}$, for two-qubit states (B) $\\ket{0,0}$, (C) $\\ket{0,1}$, (D) $\\ket{1,0}$, and (E) $\\ket{1,1}$. In this color scheme blue (white) represents $\\VH=0\\,(1.9)\\, \\mV$. On short time scales $t<T_1^{\\text{L(R)}}$, maximal transmission occurs at different frequencies for the four cases (see text for details). (F) Temporal average of the homodyne voltage transients in (B-E) over the first $500\\,\\ns$ shows well resolved peaks. (G) Measured $\\VH$ transients for drive at the cavity frequency corresponding to $\\ket{0,0}$, showing the measurement transient for the four computational states.\n\nOur device consists of a superconducting transmission-line resonator that couples two transmon qubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Beyond mediating the interaction between the qubits, the bus serves as a single detection channel for their joint readout. Arbitrary single-qubit $x$- and $y$-rotations are performed using in-phase and quadrature microwave pulses resonant with the ground to first-excited state transition of each transmon [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Reduction of leakage to the second-excited state is accomplished through the technique of derivative removal by adiabatic gate [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], resulting in error rates of $\\sim$$1\\%$ in single-qubit rotations (See attached supporting material). Local flux-bias lines tune the qubit transition frequencies on nanosecond time scales, allowing control of single-qubit dynamical phases and of a  $Z^{\\text{L}} \\otimes Z^{\\text{R}}$ interaction, both crucial for implementing a two-qubit conditional-phase (C-phase) gate\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (here $Z^{\\text{L(R)}}=\\sigma_z^{\\text{L(R)}}$ is the single-qubit Pauli $z$ operator  [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] on the left (right) qubit). A schematic of the experimental setup [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is shown in Fig. 1A.\n\nCombining the single-qubit rotations with the C-phase gate, it is possible to produce maximally-entangled states such as the four standard Bell states, $\\ket{\\Psi_{\\pm}} = (\\ket{0,0} \\pm \\ket{1,1})/\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\ket{\\Phi_{\\pm}} = (\\ket{1,0} \\pm \\ket{0,1})/\\sqrt{2}$, where $\\ket{l,r}$ denotes excitation level $l(r)$ of the left (right) qubit [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Yet, to accurately and precisely detect arbitrary two-qubit states, a complete physical model and calibration of the joint readout is necessary.\n\nThe physical mechanism enabling the joint readout is a qubit state-dependent dispersive cavity shift that is large relative to the cavity linewidth $\\kappa$. In this `strong dispersive' regime [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the system is described by a dispersive Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian\n$$\n\nH_{\\text{TC}}/\\hbar = (\\wcav+\\chiL Z^{\\text{L}} +\\chiR Z^{\\text{R}})a^{\\dag}a-\\frac{\\wL}{2}Z^{\\text{L}} - \\frac{\\wR}{2}Z^{\\text{R}},\n\n$$\nwhere $\\wcav$ is the bare resonator frequency, $\\omega^{\\text{L(R)}}$ is the Lamb-shifted ground to first excited state transition frequency for the left (right) qubit, and  $\\chi^{\\text{L(R)}}$ is the left (right) qubit-state dependent cavity shift. Actual parameter values were determined by spectroscopy experiments [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. From Eq. (1), there can be at most four distinct cavity frequencies corresponding to the joint state of the two qubits.\n\nThe linear dispersive shifts are calibrated by measurement of the transmitted homodyne voltage $\\VH$ transient when pulsing a measurement tone, having prepared each of the four computational basis states, $\\ket{0,0}$, $\\ket{0,1}$, $\\ket{1,0}$, $\\ket{1,1}$, with single-qubit rotations. Color images in Figs. 1B-1E show the transient $\\langle\\VH\\rangle$ as a function of  cavity drive frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{RF}}$ for the four cases (brackets denote an average over 600,000 repetitions).\nOn time scales $t \\lesssim T_1^{\\mathrm{L(R)}}=1.2(0.9)\\, \\us$, the largest transmission occurs at distinct frequencies for all four cases. The discrete transmission peaks are well resolved in Fig. 1F, showing the time average of $\\langle\\VH\\rangle$ versus frequency over the first $500\\,\\ns$. By matching these frequencies to Eq. (1), we extract $\\chi^{\\text{L(R)}}/2\\pi=13(4)\\,\\MHz$. On long time scales  $t\\gtrsim T_1^{\\mathrm{L(R)}}$,\nthe dominant transmission is at the peak corresponding to $\\ket{0,0}$ for all cases.  The transition between the two time limits is most evident  for $\\ket{1,1}$, which decays partially into $\\ket{0,1}$ and $\\ket{1,0}$ before completely relaxing into the ground state $\\ket{0,0}$.\n\nIt is because $\\chiL$ and $\\chiR$ are both larger than $\\kappa= 1\\, \\MHz$ that a measurement can give joint qubit information. For example, applying a measurement tone at the cavity transmission peak corresponding to $\\ket{0,0}$ queries for the joint property that both qubits are in their ground state. Given the large state-dependent dispersive shifts, the system being in any other state results in a low transmission signal. This is best shown by the four transmission transients in Fig. 1G. The transients for the states $\\ket{0,1}$, $\\ket{1,0}$ and $\\ket{1,1}$ are all different from the transient for $\\ket{0,0}$, but also not identical to each other. Qubit relaxation during the measurement results in the transients converging towards the $\\ket{0,0}$ response on long time scales.\n\nMore rigorously, the idealized measurement $M$ is a projection operator onto $\\ket{0,0}$, $M=\\ket{0,0}\\bra{0,0}=(I+\\ZL + \\ZR+ \\ZL \\otimes \\ZR)/4$, which is sensitive to the polarization of each qubit along its $z$-axis as well as to two-qubit correlations. However, the actual measurement is an ensemble average of $\\VH$ which, due to qubit relaxation and partial overlap of the dispersive peaks, we expect to be described by\n$$\n\n\\langle \\VH \\rangle = \\beta_{II}  + \\beta_{ZI} \\langle \\ZL \\rangle + \\beta_{IZ} \\langle \\ZR \\rangle + \\beta_{ZZ} \\langle \\ZL \\otimes \\ZR \\rangle+\\delta v,\n\n$$\nwhere the $\\beta_{LR}$ are constant coefficients and $\\delta v$ is classical amplifier noise (details in supporting material). The amplifier noise, which limits the single-shot fidelity to $\\sim$$10\\%$, is largely eliminated by repeating the state preparation and measurement 600,000 times over fifteen seconds.\n\nA simple set of Rabi flopping experiments can be performed (Figs. 2A-C) to validate the measurement model of Eq. (2) and place bounds on other terms. The most general model, including all linear combinations of two-qubit Pauli operators [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], is\n$$\n\nM = \\sum_{L,R \\in \\{I, X, Y, Z\\}} \\beta_{LR} L \\otimes R.\n\n$$\nFigures 2A and 2B show the measured $\\langle\\VH\\rangle$ as a function of the duration of an applied drive at $\\wL$ and $\\wR$, respectively. In each case the drive induces a Rabi oscillation of the addressed qubit around the $y$-axis of its Bloch sphere [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  The observed oscillations in $\\langle\\VH\\rangle$ are fit (solid lines) excellently by assuming the measurement model in Eq. (3) and the theoretical $\\langle Z \\rangle$ and $\\langle X \\rangle$ for driven qubits (see details in supporting material). From the fit to Fig. 2A (2B), we can estimate deviations from Eq. (2) due to the terms $\\langle\\XL\\rangle$ $(\\langle\\XR\\rangle)$ and $\\langle XZ\\rangle$ $(\\langle ZX \\rangle)$ are each $\\lesssim 2\\%$ of the full range of $\\langle \\VH\\rangle$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nMeasurement model from Rabi oscillations. (A-C) Rabi oscillations on the (A) left qubit, (B) right qubit, and (C) simultaneously on both. Solid lines are fits to the model in Eq. (3). See text for details. (D) Fourier transform (FT) of the three Rabi experiments (markers) and of best fits (curves). While the red (blue) traces show one main peak at the Rabi frequency $\\Omega^{\\text{L(R)}}$, the purple traces reveal peaks at $\\Omega^{\\text{L}}$, $\\Omega^{\\text{R}}$, $\\Omega^{\\text{L}} +\\Omega^{\\text{R}}$, and $\\Omega^{\\text{L}}-\\Omega^{\\text{R}}$, demonstrating the mixing property that makes the joint measurement sensitive to qubit-qubit correlations.\n\nThe third experiment (Fig. 2C) measures the homodyne response to simultaneous Rabi drives on both qubits. The observed oscillations not only show frequency components at the individual Rabi frequencies, $\\Omega^{\\text{L}}$ and $\\Omega^{\\text{R}}$, but also at their sum and difference. This is clearly revealed in the Fourier transform of the oscillations (Fig.\u00a02D). This mixing effect agrees quantitatively with the term  $\\langle ZZ \\rangle$ in Eq. (2). An excellent fit is also obtained, giving deviations from Eq. (2) due to $\\langle XX \\rangle$ that are $\\sim 2\\%$ of the full swing of $\\langle \\VH \\rangle$ (see details in the supporting material). These Rabi experiments thus corroborate the measurement model Eq. (2).\n\nBesides testing the measurement model, these Rabi-flopping experiments allow calibration of the coefficients $\\beta_{LR}$ in Eq. (2). The best fits give $\\beta_{II}=800\\,\\mu$V, $\\beta_{IZ}=380\\,\\mu$V, $\\beta_{ZI}=380\\,\\mu$V, and $\\beta_{ZZ}=200\\,\\mu$V. The large ratios $\\beta_{ZZ}/\\beta_{IZ(ZI)}\\approx 0.6$ indicate the high sensitivity of the joint readout to the qubit-qubit correlations.\n\nHaving substantiated the physical nature and the quantitative model of the joint readout, we next use it to perform tomography of a variety of two-qubit states, both separable and entangled, produced on demand. We first perform an over-complete set of 30 raw measurements, each obtained by applying a different pair of simultaneous rotations of the qubits prior to measurement. The qubit rotations are chosen from the set $\\{I, R_x^{\\pm\\pi}, R_x^{\\pm\\pi/2}, R_y^{\\pm\\pi/2}\\}$ (see supporting material). Using the calibration of the $\\beta_{LR}$ and least-squares linear estimation, we then construct the Pauli set $\\Pauli$, whose 16 elements are the expectation values of the two-qubit Pauli operators, $\\langle LR \\rangle$, where $L, R \\in \\{I, X, Y, Z\\}$. Two-qubit states can then be visualized by plotting the Pauli set in bar-graph format, in contrast to plotting the density-matrix in three-dimensional city-scape format\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nRepresentation of two-qubit states using the Pauli set. Experimental Pauli set (with trivial $\\langle II\\rangle=1$ not shown), obtained from  linear operations on raw measurement data, for separable states (A) $\\ket{1,0}$ and  (B) $(\\ket{0,0}-\\ket{0,1}+\\ket{1,0}-\\ket{1,1})/2$ and entangled states (C) $\\ket{\\Psi_+}$ and (D) the Bell state in the $x$-basis $\\ket{\\Phi_+}_x=(\\ket{0,0}+\\ket{0,1}-\\ket{1,0}+\\ket{1,1})/2$. Red (blue) bars correspond to left (right) single-qubit Pauli operators. Purple bars are the qubit-qubit correlations. The fidelities to the four ideal targeted states computed using Eq. (5) are $\\F=98.2 \\pm 0.4\\%$, $96.8 \\pm 0.4\\%$, $90.0 \\pm 0.6\\%$, and $92.5 \\pm 0.7\\%$. The density matrix obtained using the same raw measurements is shown in three-dimensional city-scape format to the right of each Pauli set.\n\nAn advantage of the Pauli set representation is that one can easily distinguish separable from entangled states. In Fig. 3, we use the Pauli set to view the experimentally generated separable states, (A) $\\ket{0,1}$ and (B) $(\\ket{0}+\\ket{1})_{\\text{L}}\\otimes(\\ket{0}-\\ket{1})_\\text{R}/2$, as well as entangled states, (C) $\\ket{\\Phi_+}$,  and (D) the Bell state in the $x$-basis  $\\ket{\\Psi_+}_x=(\\ket{0,0}+\\ket{1,0}-\\ket{0,1}+\\ket{1,1})/2$. For these four states, the Pauli set ideally contains three non-zero bars, all of unit magnitude. The Pauli set can be sub-divided into three sections:\nthe qubit polarization vectors, $\\vec{P}^{\\text{L}}=\\{\\langle\\XL\\rangle, \\langle\\YL\\rangle,\\langle\\ZL\\rangle\\}$ and  $\\vec{P}^{\\text{R}}=\\{\\langle\\XR\\rangle, \\langle\\YR\\rangle,\\langle\\ZR\\rangle\\}$, and the vector of two-qubit correlations $\\vec{Q}=\\{\\langle XR \\rangle, \\cdots, \\langle ZZ \\rangle \\}$. In the figure, $\\vec{P}^{\\text{L}}$, $\\vec{P}^{\\text{R}}$ and $\\vec{Q}$ are color-coded\nred, blue and purple, respectively. For the separable states, we observe near unity components in the three sub-sections of the Pauli set, $\\vec{P}^{\\text{L}}$, $\\vec{P}^{\\text{R}}$, and $\\vec{Q}$. In contrast, for the entangled states, the only large components are in $\\vec{Q}$.\nThe presence of large bars in $\\vec{Q}$ and vanishing $\\vec{P}^{\\text{L}}$, $\\vec{P}^{\\text{R}}$ is a direct signature of a high degree of entanglement.\n\nThe Pauli set representation permits testing of some simple physical constraints, which if not met, reveal systematic errors. The most easily tested physical constraint is $|\\langle LR\\rangle | \\leq 1,\\,\\forall\\, L,R$ (other constraints are $0\\leq|\\vec{P}^{\\text{L,R}}|\\leq 1$, and $0\\leq|\\vec{Q}|\\leq \\sqrt{3}$). Although the states shown in Fig. 3 satisfy these bounds, a more thorough experimental test for systematic errors is to measure the Pauli set for a collection of states that differ only by the angle of a single-qubit rotation prior to measurement. Two such evolutions are shown in Figs. 4A and 4B, which involve a rotation $\\theta$ of the left qubit about its $y$-axis after preparing the separable state $\\ket{0,0}$ (evolution A) and the entangled state $\\ket{\\Psi_+}_x$ (evolution B), respectively.\n\nIn evolution A, varying $\\theta$ produces the oscillation of the Pauli set shown in Fig. 4C. Systematic errors in detection could appear as offsets and amplitudes of the Pauli set betraying the $\\pm 1$ bounds. Such deviations would limit the accuracy of physical quantities extracted from the Pauli set, and thus are important to identify and correct. In Fig. 4C, $\\langle XI\\rangle$, $\\langle ZI\\rangle$, $\\langle XZ\\rangle$, and $\\langle ZZ\\rangle$ oscillate with an average visibility of $97.6 \\pm 0.3 \\%$, demonstrating the large swing of the meter. Moreover, the average absolute error of all the ideally zero-valued bars is $\\lesssim 10\\%$. In evolution B, the dominant oscillating components are all in $\\vec{Q}$, indicating that the state remains entangled throughout all the rotations. In this case, we find a visibility of $91.5\\pm 0.3\\%$, in good agreement with a master equation simulation taking into account qubit relaxation and dephasing. A residual oscillation amplitude of $\\sim$$10\\%$ is observed in $\\langle XI\\rangle$ and $\\langle ZI \\rangle$, a factor $\\sim$$2$ larger than expected from theory. This discrepancy can arise from a combination of small calibration errors  in single-qubit rotations and various residual higher order couplings (see supporting material).  In the future, composite pulses and shaping might further reduce these effects.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nEvolution of the Pauli set and entanglement witnesses under qubit rotations. (A and B) Gate\nsequences generating evolutions of the Pauli set by subjecting (A) the separable state $\\ket{0,0}$ and (B) the entangled state $\\ket{\\Psi_+}_x$ to  a rotation $R_y(\\theta)$ on the left qubit, $-210^{\\circ} \\leq\\theta \\leq 210^{\\circ}$. (C and D) The measured Pauli set as a function of $\\theta$ for evolutions A and B, respectively. In evolution A, the left qubit polarization rotates along the $x$-$z$ plane, while the right qubit remains fully-polarized along $z$. In evolution B, both qubit polarizations vanish, with the only nonzero and oscillating Pauli operators being qubit-qubit correlators (purple bars). Arrows at $\\theta=-90 (+90)^{\\circ}$ indicate when the ideal two-qubit state is the standard Bell state $\\ket{\\Phi_-} (\\ket{\\Psi_+})$. (E and F) Experimental lower bounds $\\mathcal{B}_i$ (orange) on the concurrence given by the optimal witnesses for Bell states $\\mathcal{W}_{\\Psi +} $ (circles), $\\mathcal{W}_{\\Psi -}$ (squares), $\\mathcal{W}_{\\Phi +}$ (triangles), and $\\mathcal{W}_{\\Phi -}$ (crosses), and fidelity $\\mathcal{F}$ to the ideal state (black circles) for (E) evolution  A and (F) evolution B.  In F, a maximum lower bound is reached by $\\mathcal{B}_{\\Phi -}$ ($\\mathcal{B}_{\\Psi +}$) at $\\theta=-90 (+90)^{\\circ}$.  (G-H) Experimental average value of CHSH operators $\\CHSHzzxx$ (circles), $\\CHSHzxxz$ (squares), $\\CHSHzxzx$ (triangles), $\\CHSHxxzz$ (crosses). (G) For evolution A all $\\mCHSH$ values stay within the separable state bounds $\\pm \\sqrt{2}$ up to measurement noise, while for (H) evolution B, $\\max \\amCHSH = 2.61 \\pm 0.04$. Solid lines are master equation simulations.\n\nFinally, we use the fully characterized and high-visibility readout to extract accurate and precise measurements of physical quantities intrinsic to the two-qubit state. Examples include the fidelity to the targeted state, entanglement witnesses, and CHSH operators.  Interrogations of such quantities are henceforth statements about the quality of the states prepared.\n\nThe fidelity $\\F$ to a targeted state provides one way of quantifying the control over two-qubit states and is given by the inner (dot) product of the measured $\\Pauli$ to that of the ideal state,\n$$\n\n\\F=\\frac{1}{4} \\Pauli \\cdot \\vec{P}_{\\text{ideal}}.\n\n$$\nFor the states produced in evolutions A and B, we find average fidelities $\\mathcal{F}=98.8 \\pm 1.0\\%$ and $93.4 \\pm 1.5\\%$ over all $\\theta$, respectively. The fidelities (black circles) in Figs. 4E-F show excellent agreement with simulation (solid lines). This agreement demonstrates the accuracy of our meter for detecting both separable and entangled states, and the high fidelity values attest to the level of two-qubit control in the experiment.\n\nMeasures beyond fidelity are necessary to quantify the degree of two-qubit entanglement. Often, entanglement monotones such as concurrence $\\conc$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] are obtained using non-linear estimators. It is standard to first perform maximum-likelihood estimation [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] to generate a physical $\\rho$ despite any statistical or systematic errors in the raw data, and to then calculate these metrics from the eigenvalue spectrum of related matrices [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  This non-linear process complicates the propagation of any statistical and systematic errors in the measurements, and can bias the estimation of such metrics as the purity of the two-qubit state increases [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (See supporting material).\n\nTo be quantitative about entanglement while using only linear operations on the raw measurements, we make use of entanglement witnesses [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. An entanglement witness is a unity-trace observable $\\W$ with a positive expectation value for all separable states, such that $\\tr(\\rho \\W)<0$ guarantees entanglement. Furthermore, $-2 \\tr(\\rho \\W)$ gives a lower bound on $\\conc$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The optimal witness for a targeted entangled state gives the tightest lower bound. For the Bell states, these are\n\n\ud835\udcb2_\u03a8 +   =   1/4 (II - XX + YY - ZZ),\n\ud835\udcb2_\u03a8 -   =   1/4 (II+XX - YY-ZZ ),\n\ud835\udcb2_ \u03a6 +   =   1/4 (II-XX-YY+ZZ),\n\ud835\udcb2_\u03a6 -   =   1/4(II+XX+YY+ZZ),\n\ngiving lower bounds $\\mathcal{B}_i = -2 \\tr(\\rho \\mathcal{W}_i)$ on $\\conc$.\n\nThe four bounds obtained for evolution A(B) are shown in Fig. 4E(4F). In evolution A, the four bounds are non-positive for all $\\theta$ to within measurement error, indicating that entanglement is not witnessed. This is as expected, since single-qubit rotations should not produce any entanglement. In Fig. 4F, in contrast, bounds $\\B_{\\Psi +}$ and $\\B_{\\Phi -}$ extend into the positive region, reaching $85.9\\pm 1.5\\%$ and $88.1 \\pm 1.5\\%$ at $\\theta=-90^{\\circ}$ and $90^{\\circ}$, respectively. There is at least one positive bound for most $\\theta$ (excluding $\\pm 180^{\\circ}$ and $0^{\\circ}$), indicating that the two qubits are entangled. Solid lines in Figs. 4E-F are obtained from the master equation simulation. The agreement between data and theory shows the accuracy of the entanglement witnesses and the small residuals $\\sim$$2\\%$ demonstrate their precision.\n\nA more well-known entanglement measure is the CHSH operator, often used to test local-hidden variable theories. CHSH operators [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] are most generally defined as\n$$\n\n\\CHSH_{A,B,A',B'}= AB +A B' + A'B -  A'B',\n\n$$\nwith left-qubit operators $A$, $A'$ and right-qubit operators $B$, $B'$ being single-qubit Pauli operators along any axis. For separable states, $\\amCHSH \\leq 2$. However, for $A \\perp A'$ and $B \\perp B'$, the separable bound is tighter, $\\amCHSH \\leq \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFrom the Pauli sets of evolutions A and B, we obtain experimental expectation values of four CHSH operators with $A,A'\\in \\{\\XL,\\ZL\\}$ and $B,B'\\in \\{\\XR,\\ZR\\}$. For the separable states of evolution A (Fig. 4G), we find that to within statistical error, $\\mCHSHzxxz=\\mXX-\\mXZ+\\mZX+\\mZZ$ (squares) and $\\mCHSHzxzx=\\mXX+\\mXZ-\\mZX+\\mZZ$ (triangles) remain within the separable bounds for all $\\theta$. For the entangled states prepared in evolution B (Fig. 4H), instead, $\\mCHSH$ oscillates past the separable bounds. At $\\theta = \\pm 45^{\\circ}$, a maximum value $\\amCHSH=2.61 \\pm 0.04$ is reached. The agreement with theory and proximity of the maximum $\\amCHSH$ to the $2\\sqrt{2}$ upper bound [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] further demonstrate the high degree of entanglement of the states produced. We note that while $\\mCHSH$ exceeds the local-hidden variable bound [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] of 2 by $\\sim$$15$ standard deviations, this result is not a strict violation of local-hidden variable theories due to locality and measurement loopholes in our system. For superconducting qubits, the measurement loophole has recently been closed using high-fidelity single-shot readout [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn summary, we have  performed metrology of entanglement between two superconducting qubits using a single measurement channel giving direct access to qubit correlations. While loopholes  preclude using this joint readout for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics, the demonstrated ability to measure fidelity to targeted states, lower bounds on concurrence and strong violation of CHSH inequalities is eminently useful for quantum-computer engineering. In its present form, this single-channel detector will be able to detect future improvements in the controlled production of entangled states and is immediately extendable to three or four qubits. Similar implementations of joint detection may prove useful for metrology of multi-qubit operations in other qubit platforms  where cross-talk and low measurement fidelity make single-shot individual qubit readouts challenging.\n\nWe acknowledge discussions with R.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Mathematical objects of quantum mechanics' section of the paper.", "completion": "In order to discuss quantum states we set up some mathematical notation.\nWe focus on finite-dimensional quantum mechanics in accordance with our emphasis on\ndigital quantum computing. Hence, we assume all vector spaces to be finite-dimensional.\nThe space of linear operators from a vector space $V$ to a vector space $W$ is denoted by $\\L(V,W)$, and we set $\\L(V) \\coloneqq \\L(V,V)$.\nA Hilbert space is a vector space with an inner product $\\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle$ (w.r.t. which it is complete).\nLet $\\H$ and $\\K$ be complex Hilbert spaces throughout the tutorial.\nWe denote the adjoint of an operator $X \\in \\L(\\H, \\K)$ by $X^\\ad$, i.e. $\\langle k , X h\\rangle = \\langle X^\\ad k, h\\rangle$ for all $h \\in \\mathcal H$ and $k \\in \\mathcal K$.\n\nAs customary in physics, we use the bra-ket notation (Dirac notation):\nwe denote vectors by ket-vectors $\\ket\\psi \\in \\H$ and linear functionals on $\\H$ by bra-vectors $\\bra\\psi$, which are elements of the dual space $\\H^\\ast$.\nFurthermore, we understand ket-vectors and bra-vectors with the same\nlabel as being related by the canonical isomorphism induced by the inner product.\nIn bra-ket notation we frequently drop tensor-product operators to shorten the notation, e.g. $\\ket\\psi\\!\\ket\\phi \\coloneqq \\ket\\psi\\otimes \\ket\\phi \\in \\K \\otimes \\H$ or $\\ketbra\\psi\\psi \\coloneqq \\ket\\psi\\otimes \\bra\\psi \\in \\K \\otimes \\H' \\cong \\L(\\K, \\H)$ for $\\ket\\psi \\in \\K$ and $\\ket\\phi \\in \\H$.\n\nTo describe the state of a quantum system we require the notion of density operators.\nThe real subspace of self-adjoint operators, $X=X^\\ad$, is denoted by $\\Herm(\\H)\\subset \\L(\\H)$ and the convex cone of positive semidefinite operators by $\\Pos(\\H) \\coloneqq \\{X \\in \\Herm(\\H) \\mid \\sandwich \\psi X \\psi \\geq 0 \\}$.\nThe trace of an operator $X \\in \\L(\\H)$ is\n$\\Tr[X]\\coloneqq \\sum_i \\sandwich iXi$, where $\\{\\ket{i}\\}\\subset \\H$ is an arbitrary orthonormal basis of $\\H$.\nThe vector space $\\L(\\H)$ is itself a Hilbert space endowed with the Hilbert-Schmidt (trace) inner-product\n$$\n\\label{eq:HS_inner_prod}\n\\langle X, Y\\rangle \\coloneqq \\Tr[X^\\ad Y]\\, .\n\n$$\nThe set of density operators is defined as\n$\\DM(\\H) \\coloneqq \\{ \\rho \\in \\PSD(\\H): \\ \\Tr[\\rho] = 1\\}$.\n\nOutcomes of a quantum measurement are modeled by random variables.\nAbstractly, a random variable is defined as a measurable function from a probability space to a measurable space $\\mathcal X$.\nHere, we are exclusively concerned with two types of random variables: (i) those that take values in a finite, discrete set\n$\\mathcal X \\cong [n] \\coloneqq \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ (understood as the measurable space with its power set as the $\\sigma$-algebra)\nand (ii) those that take values in the reals $\\mathcal X = \\RR$ (with the standard Borel $\\sigma$-algebra generated by the open sets).\nIn practice, the underlying probability space is often left implicit and one describes a\nrandom variable $X$ taking values in $\\mathcal X$ directly by its probability distribution $\\Pr$ that assigns a probability\nto an element of the $\\sigma$-algebra of $\\mathcal X$.\nFor example, for a random variable $X$ taken values in $\\RR$ and $I \\subset \\RR$ an interval, we write $\\Pr[X \\in I]$ for the probability of $X$ assuming a value in $I$.\nAbstractly speaking, $\\Pr$ is the push-forward of the measure of the probability space to $\\mathcal X$ induced by the random variable $X$. Thus, $\\Pr$ is sufficient to describe $X$.\nThe underlying probability space is, however, important to define correlations between multiple random variables which are understood to be defined on the same probability space.\n\nThe probability distribution of a discrete random variable $X$ taking values in a finite set $\\mathcal X \\cong [n]$ is characterized by its probability mass function $p_X: [n] \\to [0,1]$, $k \\mapsto p_X(k) \\coloneqq \\Pr[X = k] \\coloneqq \\Pr(X \\in \\{k\\})$.\nA real random variable $X$ is characterized by its (cumulative) distribution function $P_X: \\RR \\to [0,1]$, $x \\mapsto P_X(x) \\coloneqq \\Pr[X < x] \\coloneqq \\Pr[X \\in (\\infty, x)]$ or in case it is absolutely continuous by its probability density function $p_X: \\RR \\to [0,1]$,  $x \\mapsto p_X(x) \\coloneqq \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_x P_X(t)$.\nNote that if a discrete random variable takes values in a discrete subset of $\\RR$ we can also assign a non-continuous (cumulative)  distribution function.\n\nThe most general way to define a linear map from density operators $\\DM(\\H)$ to random variables is by means of a POVM.\nA POVM is a map from (the $\\sigma$-algebra) of $\\mathcal X$ to $\\Pos(\\mathcal H)$.\nFor a discrete random variable $X$ taking values in $[n]$ a POVM is uniquely defined by a set of effects $\\{E_i \\in \\Pos(\\mathcal H)\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ with\n$$\n\n\\sum_{i=1}^n E_i = \\1_{\\H}\\, ,\n\n$$\nwhere $\\1_{\\H}\\in \\L(\\H)$ denotes the identity operator.\nStrictly speaking the POVM is the map on the power set of $[n]$ that extends\n$k \\mapsto E_k$ additively.\nIt is convenient and common to refer to the set of effects as the POVM.\nA POVM $\\mset$ (with effects) $\\{E_i \\in \\Pos(\\mathcal H)\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ induces a map from $\\DM(\\H)$ to random variables.\nTo this end, we associate to $\\rho$ the random variable $\\mset_\\rho$ with probability mass function $p_{\\mset_\\rho}(k) \\coloneqq \\langle \\rho, E_k \\rangle$.\n\nThese are the ingredients to formalize the static postulates of quantum theory.\nWe will only require dynamics in Section\u00a0<ref> on quantum process certification.\n\n[fonttitle=]Postulate (quantum states and measure\u00adments):0\n*  Every quantum system is associated with a (separable) complex Hilbert space $\\H$.\n\n*  The state of a quantum system, its quantum state, is described by a density operator $\\rho \\in \\DM(\\H)$\n\n*\nA measurement with potential outcomes in a finite, discrete set $O \\cong [n]$ is\ndescribed by a POVM $\\mset$ with effects $\\{E_i\\}_{i \\in [n]}$.\n\n*  If a quantum system is in the state $\\rho \\in \\DM(\\H)$ and the measurement $\\mset$ is performed\nthe observed outcome is a realization of the random variable $\\mset_\\rho$ associated to $\\rho$ by $\\mset$.\n\nThe set $\\DM(\\H)$ is convex.\nIts extremal points are rank-one operators.\nA quantum state $\\rho \\in \\DM(\\H)$ of unit rank is called a pure state.\nIn particular, there exist a state vector $\\ket\\psi \\in \\H$ such that $\\rho = \\ketbra\\psi\\psi$.\nThe state vector associated to a pure quantum state is only unique up to a phase factor.\nA general quantum state is therefore a convex combination of the form $\\sum_i p_i \\ketbra{\\psi_i}{\\psi_i}$, where $p$ is a probability vector, i.e., an entry-wise non-negative vector $p\\in \\RR^d$, $p \\geq 0$ that is normalized, i.e., $\\sum_i p_i = 1$.\nA quantum state that is not pure is called mixed.\n\nGiven two\nquantum systems, their joint system should also be a quantum system.\nThis expectation is captured by the following postulate.\n\nPostulate (composite quantum systems):\nThe Hilbert space of two quantum systems with Hilbert spaces $\\mcH_1$ and $\\mcH_2$, respectively,  is the tensor product $\\mcH_1\\otimes \\mcH_2$.\nThis construction induces an embedding from $\\L(\\mcH_1)$ into $\\L(\\mcH_1\\otimes\\mcH_2)$ by\n$$\n\nA \\mapsto A

Finding an improved control methodology therefore has potential for applications in a variety of quantum systems.\n\nAlthough adiabatic quantum control has a long history, we are not aware of a theory that could address in detail our particular experimental problem: what is the optimal control trajectory for the desired CZ operation, having both short gate time and small non-adiabatic error, described in a way that is readily optimized with numerical and experimental methods.  For example, although a previous experiment used adiabaticity for a CZ gate [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the characterization and optimization of the adiabatic control waveform was not developed.  The goal here is to describe a simple theory that can be used to intuitively understand optimal waveforms for fast and accurate operation.\n\nSince we are concerned here with transition errors between the states $|11\\rangle$ and $|02\\rangle$ as their frequencies are varied, we may map this to a qubit problem for states $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ that has a fixed energy in $\\sigma_x$ from the avoided-level crossing and adjustable qubit frequency in $\\sigma_z$.  We note that this optimization problem differs from conventional quantum control, where the $\\sigma_z$ part of the Hamiltonian is fixed and both the $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$ parts can be varied.  Here, the single-component control in $\\sigma_z$ makes optimal control much more difficult since a second operator does not exist that could be used to restore the desired adiabatic character [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], disallowing standard pulse shaping techniques [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and \u201csuperadiabatic\u201d theory [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe set of possible adiabatic solutions is also influenced by other constraints with the superconducting qubit system.  First, the non-linearity of the qubits is small [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], so other unwanted transitions are not necessarily far off resonance.  For example, although the waveform is optimized for adiabaticity of the near resonance $|11\\rangle$ and $|02\\rangle$ states, fast changes in the control waveform may produce transitions between the states $|01\\rangle$ and $|10\\rangle$, even though off resonance by $\\gtrsim 200\\,\\textrm{MHz}$.  A natural solution to this constraint is using smooth waveforms, which also seems to be a good strategy in terms of controlling many qubits, achieving low crosstalk, and simplifying the requirements of control electronics and their system calibration.  We thus rule out pulse and refocussing type protocols common in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], but welcome any theory making this a practical solution.\n\nSecond, we are looking for control waveforms with fast gate times, of order $40\\,\\textrm{ns}$ for our qubits, that efficiently uses the moderate coupling $g/2\\pi \\simeq 30\\,\\textrm{MHz}$ between qubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]; note that $2\\pi/g = 33\\,\\textrm{ns}$, making this problem non-trivial for adiabaticity.  Fast gates are important for coherence, especially since errors from 1/f flux noise and off-resonant coupling to other qubits, described as frequency shifts, produce phase errors proportional to characteristic gate times: If limited by these processes, the error probability thus scales as the square of gate time.  A full system optimization of a qubit processor, for example describing the optimal choice of on-resonance qubit-qubit coupling $g$ and its smaller off-resonant coupling, is beyond the scope of this article.  But clearly even a small improvement of gate time can be quite important, motivating here a detailed understanding of both fast and accurate control.\n\nThird, the CZ gate uses adiabatic control that is non-standard, as it partially moves into the avoided level crossing regime and then back out again, with the amplitude and time of the waveform adjusted to give a $\\pi$ phase shift to the $|11\\rangle$ state.  Typical solutions to an adiabatic problem consider moving through an avoided-level crossings [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], so a theory is needed to calculate optimal waveforms for an arbitrary control problem.\n\nSince one varies only a single control parameter in $\\sigma_z$, this theory may be described in a simple manner with familiar concepts that give insight into a physical understanding of adiabatic behavior.  We first show how state change from $\\sigma_z$ control in the qubit Hamiltonian can be intuitively described in an instantaneous coordinate system.  Here, the evolution of the quantum system can be understood in the small error limit using a geometrical construction.  Second, this description allows errors to be calculated using a generalized Fourier transform.  Third, to obtain a minimum time solution for small changes in angle, the theory of window functions is used to find optimal control waveforms.  We then show how to efficiently parameterize the optimum waveform using a few-term Fourier series.  Lastly, a non-linear mapping is used to find the optimal control waveform for an arbitrary change in the control.\n\nWe also examine a second problem, microwave control of a qubit, and show that conventional two-component optimal control using $\\sigma_x$ and $\\sigma_y$ gives better results as expected, but not by much.\n\nThese results present a simple yet effective way to optimize for adiabatic fidelity when changing control only in $\\sigma_z$.  Perhaps surprisingly, non-adiabatic errors can be small even if the interaction time is only slightly larger than the time scale of the transverse coupling, similar to that proposed earlier for a non-adiabatic gate [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  A recent experiment by our group has also demonstrated that these theoretical ideas can be used to optimize CZ performance [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]."}

The sign and $u$ are chosen uniformly\nat random, except for the last $\u03c0/2$ pulse, where $u$ is chosen so\nthat the final state is an eigenstate of $\u03c3_z$.  The\ncomputational gates generate the Clifford group for one qubit. Their\nchoice is motivated by the fact that they are experimentally\nimplementable as simple pulses.  The final measurement is a\nvon Neumann measurement of $\u03c3_z$.  The last $\u03c0/2$ pulse ensures\nthat, in the absence of errors, the measurement has a known,\ndeterministic outcome for a given pulse sequence. However, the\nrandomization of the pulse sequence ensures that the outcome is not\ncorrelated with any individual pulse or proper subsequence of pulses.\n\nThe length $l$ of a randomized pulse sequence is its number of $\u03c0/2$\npulses. The $\u03c0/2$ pulses are considered to be the ones that advance\na computation. The $\u03c0$ pulses serve only to randomize the\nerrors. One can view their effect as being no more than a change of\nthe Pauli frame. The Pauli frame consists of the Pauli operator that\nneeds to be applied to obtain the intended computational state in the\nstandard basis~\\cite{knill:qc2005a}. We call the $\u03c0/2$ and Pauli\npulse combinations randomized computational gates.  In principle, we\ncan determine a pulse error rate by performing $N$ experiments for\neach length $l=1,\u2026,L$ to estimate the average probability $p_l$\nof the incorrect measurement outcome (or ``error probability'') for\nsequences of length $l$. The relationship between $l$ and $p_l$ can be\nused to obtain an average probability of error per pulse.  Suppose\nthat all errors are independent and depolarizing.  Let the\ndepolarization probability of an operation $A$ be $d_A$ and consider a\nspecific pulse sequence consisting of operations\n$A_0,A_1A_2,\u2026,A_2l+1A_2l+2,A_2l+3$, where $A_0$ is the\nstate preparation, $A_1A_2$ and the following pairs are the randomized\ncomputational gates, and $A_2l+3$ the measurement.  For the\nmeasurement, we can assume that the error immediately precedes a\nperfect measurement.  The state after $A_k$ is a known eigenstate of a\nPauli operator or completely depolarized. Depolarization of the state\nis equivalent to applying a random Pauli or identity operator, each\nwith probability $1/4$.  The probability of the state's not having\nbeen depolarized is $\u220f_j=0^k(1-d_A_j)$. In particular, we can\nexpress $p_l = E((1-\u220f_j=0^2l+3 (1-d_A_j))/2)$, where the\nfunction $E(.)$ gives the expectation over the random choices of the\n$A_j$. The factor of $1/2$ in the expression for $p_l$ arises because\ndepolarization results in the correct state $1/2$ of the time.  The\nchoices of the $A_j$ are independent except for the last $\u03c0/2$\npulse.  Assume that the depolarization probability of the last $\u03c0/2$\npulse does not depend on the previous pulses. We can then write $p_l =\n(1-(1-d_if)(1-d)^l)/2$, where $d$ is the average\ndepolarization probability of a random combination of one $\u03c0/2$- and\none Pauli pulse (a randomized computational gate), and\n$d_if$ combines the depolarization probabilities of the\npreparation, initial Pauli pulse and measurement. Thus $p_l$ decays\nexponentially to $1/2$, and the decay constant yields $d$.\n\nA commonly used metric to describe the deviation of an\nimplemented gate from the intended gate is the average fidelity $F_a$,\nwhich is defined as the uniform average over pure input states of the\nfidelity of the output state with respect to the intended output state.  We are\ninterested in the average computationally relevant error per step\nconsisting of a randomized computational gate (``average error'' for\nshort). This is given by the expectation over gates of $1-F_a$ and\nrelates to the depolarization parameter $d$ of the previous paragraph\nby $1-F_a=d/2$.  In our implementation of the randomized computational\ngates, the $\u03c0$ pulses around the $z$-axis are implemented by changes\nin rotating frame and do not involve actively applying a pulse.\nTherefore, on average, the angular distance of the randomized gate's\naction is $\u03c0$. As a result, $(1-d/2)$ represents the average\nfidelity of pulses with action $\u03c0$.\n\nAlthough estimates of $p_l$ are sufficient to obtain the average error\nfor a randomized computational gate, it is useful to\nconsider the error behavior of specific randomized computations and\neven fixed instances of the randomized sequences.  For this purpose,\nthe sequences are generated by first producing $N_G$ random sequences\nconsisting of $L$ random computational gates, where the gates are\nchosen independently without considering the final state. These\nsequences are considered to be a sample of typical computations. Each\nsequence is then truncated at different lengths. For each length, a\n$\u03c0/2$ pulse is appended to ensure that the final state is an\neigenstate of $\u03c3_z$. The sign of this final pulse is\nrandom.  The resulting sequences are randomized by\ninserting the random Pauli pulses. We can then perform experiments to\ndetermine the probability of incorrect measurement outcomes for each\nsuch sequence and for each truncated computation after randomization\nby Pauli pulses. To be specific, the procedure is implemented as\nfollows:\n\\begin{list}{}{}\n\\item[\\textbf{Randomized benchmarking for one qubit:}] This obtains\nmeasurement statistics for $N_G  N_l N_P N_e$ experiments, where $N_G$ is\nthe number of different computational gate sequences, $N_l$ is the\nnumber of lengths to which the sequences are truncated, $N_P$ is the\nnumber of Pauli randomizations for each gate sequence, and $N_e$ is\nthe number of experiments for each specific sequence.\n\\item[1.] Pick a set of lengths $l_1<l_2<\u2026<l_N_l$.

We also obtain\nthe probabilities of error for each computational gate sequence,\n$p_j,l_k = \u2211_m=1^N_Pp_j,l_k,m/N_P$. If the errors are\nindependent and depolarizing, the $p_j,l_k,m$ and the $p_j,l_k$\nshould not differ significantly from the $p_l_k$. However, if the\nerrors are systematic in the sense that each implemented pulse differs\nfrom the ideal pulse by a pulse-dependent unitary operator, this can\nbe observed in the distribution of the $p_j,l_k,m$ over $m$.  In\nthis case, the final state of each implemented pulse sequence is pure.\nThe deviation of these pure states from the expected states is\ndistributed over the Bloch sphere as $m$ and $j$ are varied. For\nexample, consider the case where $p_l_k$ is close to $1/2$. If the errors\nare systematic, the $p_j,l_k,m$ are distributed as the probability amplitude of\n$|1\u27e9$ for a random pure state. In particular, we are likely to\nfind many instances of $j$ and $m$ where $p_j,l_k,m$ is close to $0$\nor $1$, that is, differs significantly from $1/2$. In contrast, if the\nerror is depolarizing, the $p_j,l_k,m$ are all close to $1/2$\nindependent of $j$ and $m$.\n\n\\section{Trapped-ion-qubit implementation}\n\nWe determined the computationally relevant error probabilities for\ncomputational gates on one qubit in an ion trap.  The qubit was\nrepresented by two ground-state hyperfine levels of a\n$^9Be^+$ ion trapped in a linear radio-frequency Paul trap\nbriefly described in~\\cite{wineland:qc2005a}. It is the same trap that\nhas been used in a several quantum information processing\nexperiments~\\cite{barrett:qc2004a,chiaverini:qc2004a,chiaverini:qc2005a,leibfried:qc2005a,reichle:qc2006a}.\nThe two qubit states are $|\u2193\u27e9$ ($F=2,m_F=-2$) and\n$|\u2191\u27e9$ ($F=1,m_F=-1$), where for our purposes, we identify\n$|\u2193\u27e9$ with $|0\u27e9$ and $|\u2191\u27e9$ with $|1\u27e9$.\nThe state $|\u2193\u27e9$ is prepared by optical pumping, after\nlaser cooling the motional states of the ion.  We can distinguish\nbetween $|\u2193\u27e9$ and $|\u2191\u27e9$ by means of\nstate-dependent laser fluorescence. Computational gates and Pauli\npulses involving $x$- or $y$-axis rotations were implemented by means\nof two-photon stimulated Raman transitions. To ensure that the pulses\nwere not sensitive to the remaining excitations of the motional\ndegrees of freedom, we used copropagating Raman beams. It was\ntherefore not necessary to cool to the motional ground state and only\nDoppler cooling was used. Pulses involving $z$-axis rotations were\nimplemented by programmed phase changes of one of the Raman\nbeams. This changes the phase of the rotating reference frame and is\nequivalent to the the desired $z$-axis rotation.  The $z$-axis\nrotations were accompanied by a delay equivalent to the correponding\n$x$ and $y$ pulses.\n\nThe Raman beams were switched on and off and shifted in phase and\nfrequency as necessary by means of acousto-optic modulators\ncontrolled by a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The pulse sequences\nwere written in a special-purpose pulse-programming language and\nprecompiled onto the FPGA. The version of the FPGA in use for the\nexperiments was limited to about 100 computational pulses. The longest\nsequence in our experiments consisted of 96 computational gates. Our\ninitial implementations clearly showed the effects of systematic\nerrors in the distribution of the error probabilities of individual\nsequences.  This proved to be a useful diagnostic and we were able to\ncorrect these systematics to some extent. One of the largest\ncontributions to systematic errors was due to Stark shifts.  To\ncorrect for for these shifts, we calibrated them and adjusted phases\nin the pulse sequences.\n\n\\section{Experimental results}\n\nWe generated $N_G=4$ random computational sequences and truncated them\nto the $N_l=17$ lengths\n${2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,16,20,24,32,40,48,64,80,96}$.  Each truncated\nsequence was Pauli randomized $N_P=8$ times. Each final pulse sequence\nwas applied to an ion a total of $8160$ times in four groups that\nwere interleaved with the other experiments in a randomized\norder. Pulse durations, qubit-resonant frequencies and Stark shifts\nwere recalibrated automatically at regular intervals. The number of\nexperiments per pulse sequence was sufficient to obtain the\nprobability of incorrect measurement outcome with a statistical error\nsmall compared to the variation due to randomization and systematic\nerrors. Fig.~\\ref{fig:each_all} plots the fidelity (one minus the\nprobability of incorrect measurement outcome) of each of the\n$4*17*8=544$ final pulse sequences against the length of the\ncorresponding computational sequence. As explained in the figure caption,\nthe variation in fidelity for\neach length shows that non-depolarizing errors contribute\nsignificantly to error. Fig.~\\ref{fig:merged_allwl} plots the average\nfidelity over the eight Pauli randomizations of each computational\nsequence truncated to the different lengths.  Pauli randomization\nremoves coherent errors, significantly reducing the variation in\nfidelities for different computational sequences.  The remaining\nvariation could be due to the small sample of $8$ Pauli randomizations\nused to obtain the average. The empirical average probability of error\nper randomized computational gate can be obtained by fitting the\nexponential decay and was found to be $0.00482(17)$.  The fit was\nconsistent with a simple exponential decay, which suggests that these\ngates behave similarly in all computational contexts.  The error bars\nrepresent standard deviation as determined by\nnonparameteric bootstrapping~\\cite{efron:qc1993a}. In what follows,\nif the fits are good, error bars are determined\nfrom nonlinear least-squares fits. In the cases where we can obtain a\nuseful estimate of an error per randomized computational gate but the\nfits are poor, we used nonparameteric bootstrapping.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n\\begin{cntrpict}(3,3)(0,-3)\n\\nputgr{0,0}{tl}{width=3in}{each_all1_a}\n\\nputbox{-.1,-1.5}{l}{\\rotatebox{90}{\\large\\textsf{Fidelity}}}\n\\nputbox{1.5,-3}{b}{\\large\\textsf{Number of computational gates}}\n\\end{cntrpict}\n\\caption{Fidelity as a function of the number of steps for each\nrandomized sequence.

The\nrandomized benchmark does not systematically refocus changes in\nfrequency. To estimate the contribution to error from decoherence\nincluding refocusable decoherence, we performed the experiment of\nFig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cocar_decoh) without the refocusing pulse.  This is\nessentially an on-resonance Ramsey experiment. It was not\nexperimentally possible to eliminate the oscillatory shape of the\ncurve by calibrating the frequency indicating that the oscillation was\nnot simply caused by detuning from the resonant frequency, However,\nthe shape is similar to what one would expect from a roughly periodic\nchange in frequency that is not synchronized with the experiment. Such\nchanges could come from magnetic field fluctuations and phase noise\ndue to air currents in the paths of the two Raman beams. To estimate\nthe contribution to the probability of error per step, we fitted an\nexponentially decaying $\\cos(t)$ curve to the points with time\ncoordinates less than $220$ $\\mu$s. The extrapolation of the fitted\ncurve (dashed) clearly deviates from the data. Note that for\nsinusoidal phase noise, the curve should be related to a decaying\nBessel function. Fits to such a function also deviate from the\nexperimental data, consistent with the phase fluctuations not being\nsinusoidal.  Since the contribution to the probability of error is\nderived from the short-time behavior, the effect of the different\nmodels on the inferred probability of error per step is small.\n\nFor the fit shown, the inferred contribution to the probability of\nerror per step is $0.0090(7)$, larger than the error per step derived\nfrom Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:merged_allwl). This is likely due to the fact that\nin the randomized sequences, the centering of the explicit $\\pi$\npulses in their intervals reduces this contribution by refocusing.\n\nThe contribution of spontaneous emission to phase decoherence can be\ndetermined by a refocused Ramsey experiment where the two Raman beams\nare on separately half the time during the intervals between the\npulses\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. To determine the desired contribution, the probability of\n$\\ket{1}$ as a function of time is compared to the data shown in\nFig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cocar_decoh). The results of the comparisons are\nin Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cocar_spont).

They represent the statistical uncertainty. See Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:stat_and_syst_error) for comparison of both types of uncertainty and discussion in Section\u00a0<ref> for details. Note that both types of uncertainty were accounted for in the analysis and all conclusions remain intact.\n\nnaturemag\n\n100\nurl<#>1urlprefixURL\n\narute2019\nauthorArute, F. et\u00a0al.\ntitleQuantum supremacy using a programmable superconducting processor.\njournalNature volume574,\npages505 (year2019).\n<https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1666-5>\n\nbarends2014nine\nauthorBarends, R. et\u00a0al.\ntitleSuperconducting quantum circuits at the surface code\nthreshold for fault tolerance.\njournalNature volume508,\npages500 (year2014).\n\ncharles_thesis\nauthorNeill, C.\ntitleA path towards quantum supremacy with\nsuperconducting qubits.\nPh.D. thesis, schoolUniversity of California, Santa\nBarbara (year2017).\n\nYan-2018-MIT\nauthorYan, F. et\u00a0al.\ntitleTunable coupling scheme for implementing\nhigh-fidelity two-qubit gates.\njournalPhys.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Dispersive readout' section of the paper.", "completion": "A quantum measurement can be described as an entanglement of the qubit degree of freedom with a \u201cpointer variable\" of a measurement probe with a quantum Hamiltonian[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], followed by classical measurement of the probe. In circuit QED, the qubit (the quantum system) is entangled with an observable of a superconducting resonator (the probe), see Fig. <ref>(a), allowing us to gain information about the qubit state by interrogating the resonator \u2013 rather than directly interacting with the qubit. Therefore, the optimization of the readout performance is translated to maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio of a microwave probe tone sent to the resonator, while minimizing the unwanted back-action on the qubit.\n\nThe qubit-resonator interaction is described by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], previously introduced in Sec. <ref>,\n\n$$\n\nH_{\\mbox{\\tiny{JC}}} = \\omega_r \\left( a^{\\dagger}a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{\\freq}{2}\\sigma_z + g \\left( \\sigma_{+}a + \\sigma_{-}a^{\\dagger}\\right),\n\\label{Eq:JCH}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\omega_r$ and $\\freq$ denote the resonator and qubit frequencies, respectively, and $g$ is the transverse qubit-resonator coupling rate. The operators $\\sigma_{+}$ and $\\sigma_{-}$ represent the processes of exciting and de-exciting the qubit, respectively.\n\nIn the limit when the detuning between the qubit and the resonator is small compared with their coupling rate, i.e. $\\Delta = |\\freq - \\omega_r| \\ll g$, the energy levels of the two systems hybridize and a vacuum Rabi splitting of frequency $\\sqrt{n}g/\\pi$ opens up, where $n = 1,2,3...$ denotes the resonator mode. In this regime, excitations are coherently swapped between the two systems. Although useful for certain two-qubit gate operations, recall Sec. <ref>, such transverse interactions change the qubit state (since energy is directly exchanged between the resonator and the qubit) and is therefore not desired in the context of quantum non-demolition (QND) readout, in which the outcome of the quantum measurement is not altered in the act of reading out the system.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Simplified schematic of a representative experimental setup used for dispersive qubit readout. The resonator probe tone is generated, shaped and timed using an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), and sent down into the cryostat. The reflected signal $S_{11}$ is amplified, first in a parametric amplifier and then in a low-noise HEMT amplifier, before it is downconverted using heterodyne mixing and finally sampled in a digitizer. (b) Reflected magnitude $|S_{11}|$ and phase $\\theta$ response of the resonator with linewidth $\\kappa$, when the qubit is in its ground state $|0\\rangle$ (blue) and excited state $|1\\rangle$ (red), separated with a frequency $2\\chi/2\\pi$. (c) Corresponding complex plane representation, where each point is composed of the in-plane $\\mbox{Re}[S_{11}]$ and quadrature $\\mbox{Im}[S_{11}]$ components. The highest state discrimination is obtained when probing the resonator just in-between the two resonances, (dashed line in (b)), thus maximizing the distance between the states.\n\nIn the dispersive limit, i.e., when the qubit is far detuned from the resonator compared with their coupling rate $g$ and the resonator linewidth $\\kappa$, $\\Delta \\gg g, \\kappa$, there is no longer a direct exchange of energy between the two systems. Instead, the qubit and resonator push each others' frequencies. To see this, the Hamiltonian can be approximated using second-order perturbation theory[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] in terms of $g/\\Delta$, taken in the limit of few photons in the resonator. This is known as the dispersive approximation, after which the Hamiltonian takes the form\n\n$$\n\nH_{\\text{disp}} = \\bigg( \\omega_r +\\chi\\sigma_z\\bigg) \\left( a^{\\dagger}a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{\\widetilde{\\omega}_{\\text{q}}}{2}\\sigma_z,\n\\label{Eq:JCHdisp}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\chi = g^2/\\Delta$ is the qubit-state dependent frequency shift, a so-called dispersive shift, see Fig. <ref>(b), allowing us to distinguish the two qubit states. This is an asymptotically longitudinal interaction, yielding a QND measurement. Note that, in addition, the qubit frequency also picks up a Lamb shift, $\\widetilde{\\omega}_{\\text{q}} = \\freq + g^2/\\Delta$, induced by the vacuum fluctuations in the resonator. Also note that the dispersive Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) is derived for a two-level atom[In reality, superconducting qubits, just like natural atoms, have higher energy levels. These higher levels are outside of the computational subspace, but need to be taken into account for most qubit simulations to get accurate predictions of frequency shifts.]. Taking the second excited state into account and introducing the anharmonicity $\\alpha = \\omega_{\\text{q}}^{1\\rightarrow 2} - \\omega_{\\text{q}}^{0\\rightarrow 1}$ modifies the expression for the dispersive shift:\n\n$$\n\n\\chi = \\chi_{01} + \\frac{\\chi_{12}}{2} = -\\frac{g_{01}^2}{\\Delta}\\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\Delta/\\alpha}\\right),\n\\label{Eq:DispShiftTransmon}\n\n$$\n\nwhich for a transmon qubit with $\\alpha < 0$ implies that the dispersive shift will depend on the detuning. This effect is plotted in Fig. <ref>(a), where the second energy level manifests itself as a second vertical asymptote at $\\Delta/2\\pi = E_C/h$. It is also worth noting that for qubit modalities with positive anharmonicity, e.g. flux qubits, the dispersive shift will also shift the sign[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Dispersive frequency shift $\\chi/2\\pi$ as a function of qubit-resonator detuning $\\Delta/2\\pi$, according to Eq. (<ref>), for a transmon qubit with anharmonicity $\\alpha/2\\pi = -E_C/h = -300\\,$MHz, for qubit-resonator coupling rates $g/2\\pi = 50\\,$MHz (blue) and $g/2\\pi = 100\\,$MHz (red). The two vertical asymptotes at $\\Delta/2\\pi = 0$ and $\\Delta/2\\pi = E_C$ divides the dispersive shift into three regimes; For $\\Delta/2\\pi < 0$, and $\\Delta/2\\pi > E_C/h$, the dispersive shift is negative and $\\chi/2\\pi \\rightarrow 0^{-}$ as $\\Delta\\rightarrow \\pm \\infty$. For $0<\\Delta/2\\pi < E_C/2\\pi$, the dispersive shift $\\chi/2\\pi > 0$. This is called the straddling regime[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. (b) Zoomed-in plot for negative qubit-resonator detuning, the most commonly used operating regime.\n\nIn the small photon-number limit, the interaction term of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) commutes with the qubit observable[This commutation is approximate and has an asyptotic dependence on the qubit-resonator detuning], $\\sigma_z$, resulting in a QND measurement[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This is an important condition for many applications in quantum information processing.\n\nIn the case when the resonator photon number $n = a^{\\dagger}a$ exceeds a critical photon number $n_c \\equiv \\Delta^2/(4g^2)$, the dispersive Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) is no longer a valid approximation[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Therefore, the critical photon number sets an upper bound for the power level of the resonator probe signal to maintain (an approximate) QND measurement[It has been demonstrated that it is still possible to read out the qubit state by applying a very strong resonator drive tone, eventhough this readout scheme is not QND[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]]. This limitation could be lifted by implementing a pure (and not only approximate) QND readout using a manifestly longitudinal coupling between a qubit and the resonator. Several groups are currenly pursuing the implementation of longitudinal readout, in which QND readout could be performed even with larger number of resonator photons, thus improving the SNR[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nWe can also interpret the dispersive qubit-resonator interaction in another way; by rearranging the terms in Eq. (<ref>), we can equivalently write\n\n$$\n\nH_{\\text{disp}} = \\omega_r \\left( a^{\\dagger}a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\bigg( \\freq + \\underbrace{\\frac{g^2}{\\Delta}}_{\\text{Lamb shift}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{2g^2}{\\Delta}a^{\\dagger}a}_{\\text{ac-Stark shift}}\\bigg)\\sigma_z,\n\\label{Eq:JCHdisp2}\n\n$$\n\nwhere the bare qubit frequency is shifted by a fixed amount $g^2/\\Delta$, known as the Lamb shift[It is worth mentioning that the observed qubit frequency is always the Lamb-shifted frequency and not the bare qubit frequency.] as well as an amount proportional to the number of photons populating the resonator[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This effect is known as the ac-Stark shift. It has the consequence that photon number fluctuations (noise) in the resonator induce small shifts of the qubit frequency, slightly bringing the qubit out of its rotating frame and thus causing dephasing[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This means that spurious photon occupation and fluctuation in the resonator, be it thermal or coherent photons, shift the qubit frequency and causing dephasing[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For this reason, it is important to make sure that the processor is properly thermalized[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and its control lines well filtered[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and attenuated[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], to reduce photon number fluctuation."}

Thus, $\\Pr$ is sufficient to describe $X$.\nThe underlying probability space is, however, important to define correlations between multiple random variables which are understood to be defined on the same probability space.\n\nThe probability distribution of a discrete random variable $X$ taking values in a finite set $\\mathcal X \\cong [n]$ is characterized by its probability mass function $p_X: [n] \\to [0,1]$, $k \\mapsto p_X(k) \\coloneqq \\Pr[X = k] \\coloneqq \\Pr(X \\in \\{k\\})$.\nA real random variable $X$ is characterized by its (cumulative) distribution function $P_X: \\RR \\to [0,1]$, $x \\mapsto P_X(x) \\coloneqq \\Pr[X < x] \\coloneqq \\Pr[X \\in (\\infty, x)]$ or in case it is absolutely continuous by its probability density function $p_X: \\RR \\to [0,1]$,  $x \\mapsto p_X(x) \\coloneqq \\left.\\frac{d}{dt}\\right|_x P_X(t)$.\nNote that if a discrete random variable takes values in a discrete subset of $\\RR$ we can also assign a non-continuous (cumulative)  distribution function.\n\nThe most general way to define a linear map from density operators $\\DM(\\H)$ to random variables is by means of a POVM.\nA POVM is a map from (the $\\sigma$-algebra) of $\\mathcal X$ to $\\Pos(\\mathcal H)$.\nFor a discrete random variable $X$ taking values in $[n]$ a POVM is uniquely defined by a set of effects $\\{E_i \\in \\Pos(\\mathcal H)\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ with\n$$\n\n\\sum_{i=1}^n E_i = \\1_{\\H}\\, ,\n\n$$\nwhere $\\1_{\\H}\\in \\L(\\H)$ denotes the identity operator.\nStrictly speaking the POVM is the map on the power set of $[n]$ that extends\n$k \\mapsto E_k$ additively.\nIt is convenient and common to refer to the set of effects as the POVM.\nA POVM $\\mset$ (with effects) $\\{E_i \\in \\Pos(\\mathcal H)\\}_{i=1}^{n}$ induces a map from $\\DM(\\H)$ to random variables.\nTo this end, we associate to $\\rho$ the random variable $\\mset_\\rho$ with probability mass function $p_{\\mset_\\rho}(k) \\coloneqq \\langle \\rho, E_k \\rangle$.\n\nThese are the ingredients to formalize the static postulates of quantum theory.\nWe will only require dynamics in Section\u00a0<ref> on quantum process

a phase factor.\nA general quantum state is therefore a convex combination of the form $\\sum_i p_i \\ketbra{\\psi_i}{\\psi_i}$, where $p$ is a probability vector, i.e., an entry-wise non-negative

{"prompt": "What methodology was used in the paper 'A practical guide for building superconducting quantum devices'?", "completion": "Spectroscopy generally refers to the measurement of intensity as a function of frequency and is commonly used in cQED experiments to determine resonance frequencies of resonators and qubits.\n\nIdentifying the frequency of the readout resonator is usually the first step in characterizing a device. This is typically done using single-tone spectroscopy, in either the transmission, reflection, or `hanger' configuration in which one or multiple resonators are coupled to a common feedline (see\u00a0<ref>). These techniques have their respective appeals and limitations. A thorough analysis of these different resonator measurement schemes can be found in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nGenerally, transmission measurements are simple to set up and allow us to extract the amplitude and phase information of the signal as it passes through the resonator. Reflection measurements offer similar capabilities but with the added advantage of allowing a direct extraction of the internal quality factor. However, it requires a circulator in order to appropriately direct the input and output signals. This can potentially introduce additional losses in the measurement. The hanger configuration employs an unbalanced tee\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] in contrast to the circulator used in the reflection circuit. In this case, part of the input signal interacts with the resonator and upon its return, interferes with the other half that is directly transmitted through the tee. One important advantage of the hanger circuit is that it allows for many elements to be multiplexed using the same feedline. It has become a widely adopted technique in the multiplexed measurement of planar resonators.\n\nAs an example, let us consider the case of several $\\lambda/4$ CPW resonators capacitively coupled to a common microwave feedline. The measured S21 of each resonator in response to a drive at $\\omega=2\\pi f$ is described by a Lorentzian line shape, which can be written as\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]:\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:resonator_S21}\nS_{21} = A \\left[1+\\alpha\\frac{\\omega-\\omega_r}{\\omega_r}\\right]\\left[1 - \\frac{\\frac{|\\kappa_c|}{\\kappa}}{1+2i \\frac{\\omega-\\omega_r}{\\kappa}}\\right] e^{i(\\tau_v \\omega + \\phi_0)},\n\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the transmission amplitude away from resonance and $\\omega_r$ is the qubit-state dependent resonance frequency of the readout mode.\nThe parameter $\\alpha$ allows for a linear variation in the overall transmission chain in the frequency range around the resonator and $\\tau_v$ and $\\phi_0$ relate to propagation delays to and from the sample.\n\nThe frequency independent coupling rate $\\kappa_c$ denotes the strength with which the field of the resonator couples to the transmission line and is set by the system design, as discussed in Sec.\u00a0<ref>. On the other hand, $\\kappa_i$ is indicates the internal coherence properties of the resonator, and it is determined by the material quality and device layout, as discussed in Sec.\u00a0<ref>. Finally, $\\kappa$ contains contributions from both $\\kappa_i$ and $\\kappa_c$, i.e.\u00a0$\\kappa = \\kappa_c + \\kappa_i$. Fitting the measured S21 data to Eq.\u00a0<ref> returns the key parameters $\\omega_r, \\kappa$, and $\\kappa_c$, as described in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. We can also relate these coupling rates to the associated quality factors of the mode by $Q_{c, i} = \\omega_r/\\kappa_{c,i}$.\n\nRegardless of the exact measurement circuit, it is important to note that this spectroscopy experiment takes place before the optimization of the various pulses and amplification configurations. Thus, it can be challenging to obtain a clean signal at this stage. A useful technique to circumvent this issue is to perform a spectroscopy experiment in the high-power limit, where the resonator can be driven to a `bright' state regardless of the state of the qubit\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In this regime, the signal-to-noise ratio is boosted significantly as the high microwave power used in the probing tone dwarfs the noise in the system. This provides a convenient tool to quickly locate the bare resonance frequency of the readout mode $\\omega_R$ without tuning up the rest of the system.\n\nSubsequently, we can determine the `dressed' frequency of the resonator $\\tilde\\omega_R$ by repeating the spectroscopy experiment at different powers. This power sweep also provides a convenient test of whether the resonator is coupled to a qubit mode. If a qubit is dispersively coupled to the resonator, the resonance frequency will be different in the low-power (one or few photons) and high-power (hundreds of photons or more) regimes. In the transmission circuit, a typical power-vs-frequency sweep reveals a sharp resonance at the bare cavity frequency, which then undergoes a clear shift as the power is progressively reduced to the few photon limit, as shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cavspec)(a).\nThis power-dependent dispersive shift is the the Lamb-shift $\\Lambda_\\chi=g^2/\\Delta$ [<ref>].\nThe profile of the resonance at this power becomes a well-defined Lorentzian with a sufficiently narrow line-width compared to the magnitude of the dispersive coupling (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cavspec)(b)). Furthermore, based on this power sweep, we can now choose an appropriate readout power for the subsequent characterization experiments. It should produce a sufficiently high signal without causing non-linear distortions or broadening of the resonator response. In the example shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cavspec)(a), we could choose $-20\\,$dBm and $-25\\,$dBm for a high-contrast readout. It is also worth pointing out that in this particular device, the transmon qubit has some residual thermal population, which gives rise to an additional feature (labeled point C in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cavspec)(a)) besides the main low-power transmission peak. This corresponds to resonator's frequency when the transmon is in its first excited state, with the magnitude of the shift given by the dispersive coupling strength, $\\chi=2E_C (\\tfrac{g}{\\Delta})^2$ as shown in Eq.\u00a0<ref>.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nResonator power scan. (a) Outcome cavity spectroscopy experiments repeated at different input powers. The three features of interest are indicated by the arrows, corresponding to the high-power tranmissoin peak (A), lower power transmission peaks with transmon in ground state (B) and residual excited state (C), respectively.  (b) A line cut at three different powers, highlighting the clear shift in resonance frequency of the resonator as it transitions from the high- to low-power regimes.\n\nNext, we can use this un-optimized readout to identify the frequency of the qubit in a separate spectroscopy experiment. For flux-tunable qubits, a useful technique prior to qubit spectroscopy is to first move the qubit to the flux-insensitive sweet spot. This can be done by performing a resonator spectroscopy in the low-power regime while changing the current applied to the flux-bias line $I_{\\mathrm{FBL}}$. If the qubit couples to this flux line, $\\omega_r$ will depend on the flux bias through the dispersive shift $\\chi$. The period of $\\omega_r$ as a function of $I_{\\mathrm{FBL}}$ corresponds directly to the current per flux quantum $I_{\\mathrm{FBL}}/\\Phi_0$ picked up by the SQUID loop. In the regime of $\\omega_q<\\omega_r$, the qubit is at the sweet-spot when $\\omega_r$ is at a maximum. This also provides an estimate of the dispersive shift and the rough frequency regime of the qubit. While these are rather crude estimates, it is nonetheless helpful to narrow down the possible range of the qubit frequency as it can sometimes be challenging to identify the qubit resonance, which is typically much narrower (higher-Q) compared to the readout mode.\n\nThe technique for measuring the resonance frequency of the qubit is often referred to as a \u201ctwo-tone\" continuous-wave spectroscopy. In this protocol, a constant microwave tone is applied at $\\omega_r$ while a second drive ($\\omega_s$), with variable frequency, is employed to probe the state of the qubit. When this second tone comes close to the resonance of the qubit, i.e. $\\omega_s\\approx \\omega_q$, the frequency of the resonator changes due to the dispersive coupling. This shift leads to a change in the resonator's response to the constant drive tone at $\\omega_r$ and hence, provides an indication of the qubit state.\n\nWhile this is conceptually straightforward, it can sometimes be challenging to implement in practice. One of the difficulties relates to the power that is applied to the qubit via the spectroscopy tone. If the power is too low, the qubit will not get excited even if the drive frequency is close to its resonance and thus, no shift will be observed. On the other hand, if too much power is applied, the line width of the resonance will increase due to power broadening\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], eventually resulting in the peak becoming so wide that it can no longer be distinguished from the background. It can be hard to estimate what the \u201cright\u201d amount of power is for spectroscopy because this depends on how strongly the qubit couples to the drive line, something that is unknown before characterizing the device. An operational approach to this problem is to simply repeat the spectroscopy experiment for different powers until the resonance is found.\n\nFollowing this, we can confirm that it is indeed the qubit mode of interest by verifying the flux-dependence of its resonance frequency. Furthermore, in order to obtain a slightly more precise reading of the qubit frequency, we often employ another form of two-tone spectroscopy where both drives are pulsed, rather than continuous. Typically, a (square) pulse is first applied at $\\omega_s$, in the vicinity of the previously found qubit frequency, followed by a second pulse at $\\omega_r$. The pulsed-spectroscopy experiment removes the AC Stark shift the qubit experiences due to the always-on readout tone\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Furthermore, the absence of these continuous drives also prevent spurious heating of the device due to dissipation of microwave power at 20 mK, where the cooling power of the dilution refrigerator is limited to several $\\mu$W.\n\nAfter identifying the qubit, the anharmonicity can be determined by a simple variant of a regular two-tone spectroscopy experiment with the introduction of a third drive. This three-tone spectroscopy allows us to have an additional probe that could induce the $\\ket{1}\\leftrightarrow{\\ket{2}}$ transition of the transmon at frequency $f_{12}$ while also performing operations on the readout resonator and the $\\ket{0}\\leftrightarrow{\\ket{1}}$ transition of the qubit.\n\nIn such an experiment, the first spectroscopy tone ($s1$) is varied in frequency $f_{s1}$ around the $\\ket{0}\\leftrightarrow{\\ket{1}}$ resonance of the transmon at frequency $f_{01}$. The frequency, $f_{s2}$, of the second spectroscopy tone ($s2$) is swept around the expected $\\ket{1}\\leftrightarrow{\\ket{2}}$ transition, which is typically $\\sim 200-300\\,$MHz below the $\\ket{0}\\leftrightarrow{\\ket{1}}$ resonance. The the $\\ket{0}\\leftrightarrow{\\ket{1}}$ transition manifests as a line at $f_{s1}=f_{01}$ while the $\\ket{2}$ state appears as a diagonal line corresponding to the condition $f_{s1}+f_{s2} = f_{01}+f_{12}$. The location of this second transition indicates the anharmonicity of the transmon, which can be an important consideration for the design and calibration of subsequent single-qubit operations."}

The resonator frequency change (and thus the qubit state) is sensed by applying the microwave field with amplitude $\\varepsilon$, then amplifying the transmitted or reflected signal, and then mixing it with the applied microwave field to measure its phase and amplitude (Fig. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r)).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency $\\omega_{\\rm r}$ (due to qubit-resonator interaction with strength $g$), and this is sensed by passing the microwave through (or reflecting from) the resonator. The amplified outgoing microwave is combined with the local oscillator at the mixer, whose output is measured to discriminate the qubit states. The energy decay $\\kappa$ of the resonator is mainly due to its coupling with the transmission line.\n\nIn the process of measurement, the qubit decays with the Purcell\nrate [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n\u0393\u2248\u03ba\ng^2/(\u03c9_q-\u03c9_r)^2,\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the resonator energy damping rate (mostly due to leakage into the transmission line \u2013 see Fig. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r)). Note that in this formula we do\nnot distinguish the bare and effective frequencies. In the quantum\nlanguage this can be interpreted as the leakage with the rate\n$\\kappa$ of the qubit \u201ctail\u201d $g^2/(\\omega_{\\rm q}-\\omega_{\\rm\nr})^2$, existing in the form of the resonator photon. However, the\nPurcell decay also has a simple classical interpretation via the resistive damping\n[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], essentially being a linear effect, in contrast to\nthe dispersion (<ref>) \u2013 see Appendix for more\ndetails, including dependence of $\\Gamma$ on $n$ [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe Purcell decay leads to measurement error; therefore, it is\nimportant to reduce the rate $\\Gamma$. This can be done by\ndecreasing the ratio $g/|\\omega_{\\rm q}-\\omega_{\\rm r}|$; however,\nthis decreases $\\chi$ and thus increases the necessary measurement\ntime $t_{\\rm m}$ (see Appendix for more details). Another way to\ndecrease $\\Gamma$ is to use a very small leakage rate $\\kappa$;\nhowever, this also increases the measurement time $t_{\\rm m}$\nbecause the ring-up and ring-down processes give a natural\nlimitation $t_{\\rm m} \\agt 4\\,\\kappa^{-1}$, and in many practical\ncases it is even $t_{\\rm m} \\gg 10 \\,\\kappa^{-1}$.\n\nIt would be good if the rate $\\kappa$ which governs the measurement time were\ndifferent from $\\kappa$ in Eq. (<ref>): specifically if\n$\\kappa$ for the Purcell decay were much smaller than $\\kappa$ for the measurement. This\nis exactly what is achieved by using the bandpass filter of Ref.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. There are other ways to explain how this Purcell\nfilter works [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], but here we interpret the main idea\nof the bandpass Purcell filter as producing different effective\nrates $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ for the measurement and for the Purcell decay (so\nthat the measurement microwave easily passes through the filter,\nwhile the propagation of the photon emitted by the qubit is strongly\nimpeded by the filter).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nQubit measurement schematic with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter  of Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The readout resonator with\nfrequency $\\omega_{\\rm r}$ (which depends on the qubit state) is\ncoupled (coupling $\\mathcal{G}$) with a filter resonator of\nfrequency $\\omega_{\\rm f}$, which decays into the transmission line\nwith the rate $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$. The further processing of the\noutgoing microwave (not shown) is the same as in Fig. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r).\nThe microwave drive can be applied either to the readout\n($\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$) or to the filter ($\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}$)\nresonators. Coupling with the decaying filter resonator produces an\neffective decay rate $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ of the readout resonator,\nwhich depends on the drive frequency. As a result, for the\nmeasurement microwave $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}=\\kappa_{\\rm r}$, while the\nqubit sees a much smaller value $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}=\\kappa_{\\rm q}$,\nthus leading to a suppression of the qubit Purcell decay by a factor $\\kappa_{\\rm q}/\\kappa_{\\rm r}$.\n\nThe schematic of the qubit measurement with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter of Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is shown in Fig. (Figure: Qubit measurement schematic with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter  of Ref. <cit.>).\nBesides the readout resonator with qubit-state-dependent frequency $\\omega_{\\rm\nr}=\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}$ or $\\omega_{\\rm r}=\\omega_{\\rm\nr}^{|g\\rangle}$, there is a second (filter)\nresonator with frequency $\\omega_{\\rm f}$, coupled with the readout\nresonator with the coupling $\\mathcal{G}$. (The coupling\n$\\mathcal{G}$ is inductive, but we draw it as capacitive to keep the figure simple.) The filter resonator leaks the microwave into the\ntransmission line with a relatively large damping rate $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$, so\nthat its $Q$-factor is $Q_{\\rm f}=\\omega_{\\rm f}/\\kappa_{\\rm f}\n\\simeq 30$, while $|\\mathcal{G}|\\ll \\kappa_{\\rm f}$. The leaked\nfield is then amplified and sent to the mixer (not shown) in the\nsame way as in the standard cQED setup. The readout and filter\nresonators are in general detuned from each other, but not much,\n$|\\omega_{\\rm r}-\\omega_{\\rm f}|\\alt \\kappa_{\\rm f}$ (detuning is needed to\nmultiplex readout of several qubits using the same filter resonator\n[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]; for simplicity we consider the measurement of only one qubit). The filter resonator is pumped with the\ndrive frequency $\\omega_{\\rm d}$ (close to $\\omega_{\\rm r}$) and\namplitude $\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}$. However, for us it will be easier\nto first assume instead that the readout resonator is pumped with\namplitude $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$ (Fig. (Figure: Qubit measurement schematic with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter  of Ref. <cit.>)), and then show\nthe correspondence between the drives $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$ and\n$\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}$.\n\nLet us use the rotating wave approximation [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] with the rotating frame $e^{-i\\omega_d t}$ based on the drive\nfrequency $\\omega_{\\rm d}$. Then the evolution of the classical\nfield amplitudes $\\alpha (t)$ and $\\beta (t)$ in the readout and\nfilter resonators, respectively, is given by the equations\n$$\n\n& \\dot {\\alpha} =-i\\Delta_{\\rm rd} \\alpha -i\\mathcal{G}\\beta\n-i\\varepsilon_{\\rm r} ,\n\\label{alpha-dot-1} \\\\\n&  \\dot {\\beta} = -i\\Delta_{\\rm fd}\\beta -i\\mathcal{G}^*\\alpha\n-\\frac{\\kappa_{\\rm f}}{2}\\, \\beta , \\label{beta-dot-1}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are normalized so that $|\\alpha|^2$ and\n$|\\beta|^2$ are the average number of photons in the resonators,\n$\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$ is normalized correspondingly, and\n\u0394_rd = \u03c9_r- \u03c9_d,\n\u0394_fd = \u03c9_f- \u03c9_d\n(recall that $\\omega_{\\rm r}$ depends on the qubit state). If we are\nnot interested in the details of evolution on the fast time scale\n$\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{-1}$, then we can use the quasisteady state for\n$\\beta$ [obtained from Eq. (<ref>) using $\\dot \\beta=0$],\n\u03b2= -i \ud835\udca2^*/\u03ba_f/2 + i \u0394_fd  \u03b1,\nwhich can then be inserted into Eq. (<ref>), giving\n$$\n\n&& \\dot {\\alpha} = -i(\\Delta_{\\rm rd}+\\delta \\omega_{\\rm r}) \\,\n\\alpha -\\frac{\\kappa_{\\rm eff}}{2} \\, \\alpha -i\\varepsilon_{\\rm r},\n\\label{alpha-dot-2}\\\\\n&& \\kappa_{\\rm eff} = \\frac{4 |\\mathcal{G}|^2}{\\kappa_{\\rm f}} \\,\n\\frac{1}{1+(2\\Delta_{\\rm fd}/\\kappa_{\\rm f})^2} ,\n\\label{kappa-eff}\\\\\n&& \\delta\\omega_{\\rm r} = - \\frac{ |\\mathcal{G}|^2  \\Delta_{\\rm\nfd}}{(\\kappa_{\\rm f} /2)^2 +\\Delta_{\\rm fd}^2}=-\\frac{\\Delta_{\\rm\nfd}}{\\kappa_{\\rm f}}\\, \\kappa_{\\rm eff} .\n\\label{delta-omega-r}\n\n$$\nThus we see that the field $\\alpha$ evolves in practically the same\nway as in the standard setup of Fig. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r); however,\ninteraction with the filter resonator shifts the readout resonator\nfrequency by $\\delta\\omega_{\\rm r}$  and introduces the effective\nleakage rate $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ of the readout resonator.\n\nMost importantly, $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ depends on the drive frequency.\nFor measurement we use $\\omega_{\\rm d} \\approx \\omega_{\\rm r}$, so\n$\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ is approximately\n\u03ba_r \u22614 |\ud835\udca2|^2/\u03ba_f\n1/1+[2(\u03c9_r-\u03c9_f)/\u03ba_f]^2 .\nHowever, when the qubit tries to leak its excitation through the\nreadout resonator, this can be considered as a drive at the qubit\nfrequency, $\\omega_{\\rm d}=\\omega_{\\rm q}$, and the corresponding\n$\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ is then\n\u03ba_q \u22614 |\ud835\udca2|^2/\u03ba_f\n1/1+[2(\u03c9_q-\u03c9_f)/\u03ba_f]^2,\nwhich is much smaller than $\\kappa_{\\rm r}$ if the qubit is detuned\naway from the filter linewidth, $|\\omega_{\\rm q}-\\omega_{\\rm f}| \\gg\n\\kappa_{\\rm f}$. This difference is exactly what we wished for  suppressing the\nPurcell rate $\\Gamma$: the measurement is governed by $\\kappa_{\\rm\nr}$, while the qubit sees a much smaller value $\\kappa_{\\rm q}$.\nTherefore, we would expect that the Purcell rate is given by Eq.(<ref>) with $\\kappa=\\kappa_{\\rm q}$ [see Eq. (<ref>) later], while the\n\u201cseparation\u201d measurement error is given by Eqs.(<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) with $\\kappa=\\kappa_{\\rm r}$\n(see Appendix). As a result, compared with the standard setup (Fig.(Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r)) with the same physical parameters for measurement, the\nPurcell rate is suppressed by the factor\nF= \u03ba_q/\u03ba_r =\n1+[2(\u03c9_r-\u03c9_f)/\u03ba_f]^2/1+[2(\u03c9_q-\u03c9_f)/\u03ba_f]^2 \u226a1.\nThis is essentially the main result of this paper, which will\nbe confirmed by the quantum analysis in the next section. (To avoid a possible confusion, we note that $\\kappa_{\\rm q}$ is not the qubit decay rate; it is the resonator decay, as seen by the qubit.)\n\nOur result for the Purcell suppression factor was based on the\nbehavior of the field amplitude in the readout resonator. Let us\nalso check that the field $\\gamma_{\\rm tl}$ propagating in the outgoing\ntransmission line behaves according to the effective model as well.\nThe outgoing field amplitude is $\\gamma_{\\rm tl}=\\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm\nf}}\\, \\beta$ (in the normalization for which $|\\gamma_{\\rm tl}|^2$ is\nthe average number of propagating photons per second). Using Eq.(<ref>), we find\n\u03b3_tl = -i \ud835\udca2^* \u221a(\u03ba_f)/\u03ba_f/2 + i \u0394_fd  \u03b1= e^i \u03c6\n\u221a(\u03ba_eff)   \u03b1,\nso, as expected, the outgoing amplitude behaves as in the standard\nsetup of Fig. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r) with $\\kappa=\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$, up to an\nunimportant phase shift $\\varphi= {\\rm arg} [-i\n\\mathcal{G}^*/(\\kappa_{\\rm f}/2 + i \\Delta_{\\rm fd})]$. Note that to\nshow the equivalence between the dynamics (including transients) of\nthe systems in Figs. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r) and (Figure: Qubit measurement schematic with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter  of Ref. <cit.>) we needed the\nassumption of a sufficiently large $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ in order to use\nthe quasisteady state (<ref>). However, this assumption is\nnot needed if we consider only the steady state (without\ntransients).\n\nSo far we assumed that the measurement is performed by driving the\nreadout resonator with the amplitude $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$. Now let\nus consider the realistic case [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] when the\ndrive $\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}$ is applied to the filter resonator. The evolution equations (<ref>) and (<ref>) for the classical field amplitudes are then replaced by\n$$\n\n& \\dot {\\alpha} =-i\\Delta_{\\rm rd} \\alpha -i\\mathcal{G}\\beta ,\n\\label{alpha-dot-3} \\\\\n&  \\dot {\\beta} = -i\\Delta_{\\rm fd}\\beta -i\\mathcal{G}^*\\alpha\n-\\frac{\\kappa_{\\rm f}}{2}\\, \\beta -i\\varepsilon_{\\rm f} ,\n\\label{beta-dot-3}\n\n$$\nso that the quasisteady state for the filter resonator is\n\u03b2= -i \ud835\udca2^* /\u03ba_f/2 + i \u0394_fd  \u03b1+  -i\u03b5_f/\u03ba_f/2 + i \u0394_fd ,\nand the field evolution in the readout resonator is\n\u03b1\u0307 = -i(\u0394_rd+\u03b4\u03c9_r)\n\u03b1-\u03ba_eff/2   \u03b1-\n\ud835\udca2/\u03ba_f/2 + i \u0394_fd\n\u03b5_f,\n\nwith the same $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ and $\\delta\\omega_{\\rm r}$  given\nby Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>). The only\ndifference between the effective evolution equations\n(<ref>) and (<ref>) is a linear relation,\n\u03b5_r \u2194-i  \u03b5_f\n\ud835\udca2 /(\u03ba_f/2 + i \u0394_fd),\nbetween the\ndrive amplitudes $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}$\nproducing the same effect. Therefore, our results obtained above remain\nunchanged for driving the filter resonator, and the Purcell rate\nsuppression factor is still given by Eq. (<ref>).\n\nNote that in the quasisteady state the separation between the filter\namplitudes $\\beta$ for the two qubit states does not depend on\nwhether the drive is applied to the filter or readout  resonator, as\nlong as we use the correspondence (<ref>) between the drive\namplitudes. The same is true for the separation between the outgoing\nfields $\\gamma_{\\rm tl}$. Similarly, the separation between the\noutgoing fields for the two qubit states is the same (up to  the\nphase $\\varphi$) as in the standard setup of Fig. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r) with\n$\\varepsilon=\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$, $\\kappa =\\kappa_{\\rm r}$, and the\nresonator frequency adjusted by $\\delta\\omega_{\\rm r}$ given by Eq.(<ref>). Therefore, these configurations are\nequivalent to each other from the point of view of quantum\nmeasurement, including interaction between the qubit and readout\nresonator, extraction of quantum information, back-action, etc.\n\nNevertheless, driving the filter resonator produces a different\noutgoing field $\\gamma_{\\rm tl}=\\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm f}}\\, \\beta$,\nwhich now contains an additional term $-i\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}\n\\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm f}} / (\\kappa_{\\rm f}/2 + i \\Delta_{\\rm fd})$ in\ncomparison with Eq. (<ref>), which comes from the second\nterm in Eq. (<ref>). In particular, instead of the\nLorentzian line shape of the transfer function when driving the\nreadout resonator, the transfer function for driving the filter is\n(in the steady state)\n\u03b3_tl^(f)/\u03b5_f=\n\u221a(\u03ba_f)/\u03ba_f/2+i\u0394_fd\n2\u0394_rd/\u03ba_eff/1 +2i (\u0394_rd+\u03b4\u03c9_r)/\u03ba_eff,\nwhere $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ can be replaced with $\\kappa_{\\rm r}$.

Such symmetric choice of the drive frequency provides\nthe largest separation between the two coherent states for a fixed\ndrive amplitude if $2 \\,|\\chi|<\\kappa_{\\rm r}$.

(<ref>)(a) shows that the field in the filter resonator is\nsymmetric only when driving the readout resonator (red curves,\n$\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|g\\rangle}=\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|e\\rangle}=1.2$),\nwhile it is strongly asymmetric when the filter resonator is driven (blue\ncurves, $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|g\\rangle}=0.01$, $\\bar{n}_{\\rm\nf}^{|e\\rangle}=1.0$; $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|g\\rangle}$ is very small\nbecause for our parameters $\\delta\\omega_{\\rm r}\\approx |\\chi|$ and therefore $\\omega_{\\rm d}\\approx \\omega_{\\rm\nr}^{|g\\rangle}$). The number of photons in the filter is much less\nthan in the readout resonator because $\\kappa_{\\rm f} \\gg\n\\kappa_{\\rm r}$.\n\nIn Fig. (Figure: Phase-space transient evolution of qubit-state-dependent\ncoherent states in the filter resonator for driving either the\nreadout resonator (red curves, left) or the filter (blue curves, right), with the\ndrive amplitudes related via Eq. (<ref>)(b) we choose $\\omega_{\\rm d}$ so that in the\nsteady state $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|g\\rangle}=\\bar{n}_{\\rm\nf}^{|e\\rangle}$ for driving the filter; this is the natural choice\nfor decreasing the microwave power to be amplified. This occurs at\n$\\omega_{\\rm d}/2\\pi =6.80120$, which is close to the expected value\n$(\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle}+\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle})/2$, but not\nequal because of the asymmetry of the line shape (<ref>).\nWe choose the amplitudes to produce $\\bar{n}_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}=50$\n(then $\\bar{n}_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle}=22$). The difference between\n$\\bar{n}_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}$ and $\\bar{n}_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle}$\nleads to different values $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|e\\rangle}=1.2$ and\n$\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|g\\rangle}=0.5$ when driving the readout\nresonator, while for driving the filter the field in the filter is\nsymmetric, $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|e\\rangle}=\\bar{n}_{\\rm\nf}^{|g\\rangle}=0.2$. Compared to the case of Fig.  (Figure: Phase-space transient evolution of qubit-state-dependent\ncoherent states in the filter resonator for driving either the\nreadout resonator (red curves, left) or the filter (blue curves, right), with the\ndrive amplitudes related via Eq. (<ref>)(a),\nthere is 5 times less power to be amplified for the $|e\\rangle$\nstate (when driving the filter); however, the state separation is\n1.3  times smaller (in amplitude) for the same $\\bar{n}_{\\rm\nr}^{|e\\rangle}$. Thus, there is a trade-off between the state\nseparation and amplified power in choosing the drive frequency.\nComparing the red and blue curves in Fig. (Figure: Phase-space transient evolution of qubit-state-dependent\ncoherent states in the filter resonator for driving either the\nreadout resonator (red curves, left) or the filter (blue curves, right), with the\ndrive amplitudes related via Eq. (<ref>)(b), we see that in the steady state $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|g\\rangle}$ and  $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|e\\rangle}$  are smaller for driving the\nfilter rather than the readout resonator. This is beneficial because\nthere is less power to be amplified; however, the ratio is not very big (as\nexpected for a moderate value $|\\chi|/\\kappa_{\\rm r}=0.28$).\n\nNote that our definition of $\\kappa_{\\rm r}$ in Eq.(<ref>) is not strictly well-defined because the resonator\nfrequency $\\omega_{\\rm r}$ depends on the qubit state, and the\ndrive frequency can be in between $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm |e\\rangle}$\nand $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm |g\\rangle}$. However, this frequency\ndifference is much smaller than $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$, and therefore not\nimportant for practical purposes in the definition of $\\kappa_{\\rm\nr}$. In an experiment $\\kappa_{\\rm r}$ can be measured either via the field decay\n[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] or via the linewidth of the steady-state transfer\nfunction showing the dip of $|\\gamma_{\\rm tl}^{\\rm (f)}/\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}|$ near the resonance $\\omega_{\\rm d}=\\omega_{\\rm r}$  [Eq. (<ref>)], since near the dip $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}\\approx \\kappa_{\\rm r}$.\n\nThus far we assumed that all decay $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ in the filter\nresonator is due to the leakage $\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{\\rm out}$ into the\noutgoing transmission line. If $\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{\\rm out} <\n\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ and the decay $\\kappa_{\\rm f}-\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{\\rm\nout}$ is due to leakage into the line delivering the drive\n$\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}$ or due to another dissipation channel, then\nthe only difference compared to the previous discussion is the extra\nfactor $\\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{\\rm out}/\\kappa_{\\rm f}}$ for the\noutgoing field $\\gamma_{\\rm tl}$. This will lead to multiplication\nof the overall quantum efficiency of the measurement by $\\kappa_{\\rm\nf}^{\\rm out}/\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ and will only slightly affect the\nmeasurement fidelity.  Adding dissipation in the readout resonator with\nrate $\\kappa_{\\rm r,d}$ increases the effective linewidth to\n$\\kappa_{\\rm eff}+\\kappa_{\\rm r,d}$ and multiplies the quantum\nefficiency by $\\kappa_{\\rm r}/(\\kappa_{\\rm r}+\\kappa_{\\rm r,d})$.\nMost importantly, since $\\kappa_{\\rm r,d}$ does not change with\nfrequency, the Purcell suppression factor (<ref>) becomes\n$(\\kappa_{\\rm q}+\\kappa_{\\rm r,d})/(\\kappa_{\\rm r}+\\kappa_{\\rm\nr,d})$, so that the Purcell filter performance deteriorates; we will\ndiscuss this in a little more detail in Sec. III$\\,$C.\n\nNote that our main result (<ref>) for the Purcell suppression\nfactor is slightly different from the result $F=[\\kappa_{\\rm\nf}/2(\\omega_{\\rm q}-\\omega_{\\rm r})]^2 (\\omega_{\\rm q}/\\omega_{\\rm\nr})^2$, which was derived in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] using the\ncircuit theory. The reasons are the following. First, in the\nderivation of [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] it was assumed that the two\nresonators have the same frequency, which makes the numerator in\nEq. (<ref>) equal to 1. Second, the term 1 in the denominator\nin Eq. (<ref>) was essentially neglected in comparison with the\nlarger second term. Finally, the role of the factor $(\\omega_{\\rm\nq}/\\omega_{\\rm r})^2$ is not quite clear. In the derivation of Ref.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] keeping this factor was exceeding the accuracy of\nthe derivation, while in our derivation we essentially use the\nrotating wave approximation, which assumes $\\omega_{\\rm\nq}/\\omega_{\\rm r}\\approx 1$. Aside from these small differences, our\nresult coincides with the result of Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]."}

{"prompt": "Explain the '## Coherence measurements' section of the paper.", "completion": "After tuning up a $\\pi$ pulse using a Rabi oscillation, the next step is to determine the coherence properties of the qubit, namely, the relaxation time $T_1$, the Ramsey time $T_2^\\star$, and the Echo dephasing time $T_2^E$.\n\nTo measure the relaxation time, the qubit, initialized in $|{0}\\rangle$, is excited to $|{1}\\rangle$ with a $\\pi$ pulse. This is then followed by a variable wait time $t$, and finally a measurement of qubit state. This results in an exponentially decaying signal, given by :\n$$\n\nS(t) = A\\cdot e^{-t/T_1}+B,\n\n$$\nwhere $S(t)$ is the signal as a function of wait time $t$, $A$ and $B$ are scaling and offset factors.\n\nThe Ramsey dephasing time can be obtained by initializing the qubit in $\\ket{0}$, applying a $\\pi/2$ pulse, waiting for a time $t$, applying a final $\\pi/2$ pulse and then measuring the qubit.\nThe Ramsey experiment will produce an (often exponentially) decaying oscillation described by:\n$$\n\\label{eq:t2star}\nS(t) = A e^{-(t/T_2^\\star) ^ n} \\cdot (\\cos(2 \\pi f t + \\phi) + C) +B,\n\n$$\nwhere $A$,$B$ and $C$ are scaling and offset factors, $n$ describes the profile of the exponential decay, and $f$ the frequency of the oscillation. This oscillation frequency, $f$, corresponds to the frequency detuning between the control pulses and the actual qubit frequency. Because it is difficult to distinguish an oscillation due to a low frequency (small detuning) from an exponential decay, the pulses are often slightly detuned intentionally to make this distinction more obvious. This can be either done by physically detuning the microwave source, or by changing the phase of the second $\\pi/2$ pulse (artificial detuning).\n\nIn general, $T_1$ measurement probes the overall energy relaxation times due to all the loss channels in the system, and provides an indication of the internal quality factors of the device. The Ramsey time contains information on both energy relaxation and pure dephasing ($T_{\\phi}$) in the qubit, i.e. $1/T_2^\\star = 1/(2T_1) + 1/T_{\\phi}$. It provides a useful metric for quantifying the effective decoherence time scales of the qubit and a rough bound on the performance of the subsequent single-qubit gates.\n\nThe profile of the decay $n$ in Eq.\u00a0<ref> provides some indication of whether $T_2^\\star$ is limited by $T_1$ or another source of incoherent noise $n\\approx1$. If there is a coherent noise process, such as a slow drift in the qubit frequency, $n$ will be larger than 1. In this case, it is possible to recover part of the information by adding an echo pulse. The echo dephasing time $T_2^E$ can be measured by adding a single $\\pi$ pulse in the middle of a Ramsey experiment. The final experiment consists of preparing the qubit, applying a $\\pi/2$ pulse, waiting for a time $t/2$, applying a $\\pi$ pulse, waiting for a time $t/2$, and applying a final $\\pi/2$ pulse before measuring the qubit state. The resulting dynamics now follows an exponential decay, given by\n$$\n\nS(t) = A\\cdot e^{-(t/T_2^E)^n}+B.\n\n$$\nApart from this simple sequence, there are many other different types of echo configurations developed in the field of nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR) in the early days of quantum computing. By employing the appropriate sequences, it is possible to significantly increase the quality of certain single-qubit operations. A more detailed discussion on these useful techniques can be found in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nAdditionally, all of these coherence measurements can be applied to characterize the properties of the higher-order transitions in the transmon as well. In particular, the second excited state ($|f\\rangle\\rangle)$ in the trasmon qubit typically has coherence properties comparable to that of the two lowest levels and can even be employed as a distinct mode for certain specialized tasks\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn general, the careful characterization of a qubit's coherence provides crucial information about both the design and fabrication of the device as well as the quality of the measurement and control set-up. We refer to the recent review by Krantz et al.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for a detailed explanation of these decoherence channels as well the associated experimental protocols. In addition to the basic relaxation and dephasing experiments, valuable information on the mechanisms that are limiting the coherence properties of the device can be gleaned by measuring coherence as a function of flux bias\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]."}

Points with fidelity below 98.9\n\nGate driving\nWe activated the gate interaction associated with each transition by simultaneously applying a charge drive to each fluxonium [fig:map_specb inset].\nThese drives were chosen to have equal amplitude, with a relative phase between them to maximize constructive interference at the intended transition.\nWe found that using two constructive drives was a convenient method for reducing the total applied power for a given Rabi rate, resulting in a reduced ac-Stark shift from off-resonant transitions.\nIn severe cases, a large ac-Stark shift could prevent the realization of a 180$^\\circ$ conditional phase and increase leakage into non-computational states.\nAn alternative approach exists to tune the relative phase and amplitude of the two drives to result in complete destructive interference of the nearest leakage transition (see appendix:microwave_crosstalk).\nWhile theoretically we expect the relative phase and amplitude to be important for reducing leakage, we found that as long as a\u00a0$180^\\circ$ conditional phase was attainable, the CZ gate fidelity was relatively insensitive to these two parameters.\nfig:map_specb shows the familiar Rabi chevrons when the transition was driven as a function of frequency; in experimental practice, our two-qubit gate is quite similar to driving single-qubit Rabi oscillations.\n\nGate calibration and characterization\nFor a given transition and pulse duration, there are four critical parameters associated with the CZ gate to calibrate: (1) the overall drive amplitude of the two phase-locked drives to ensure a single-period oscillation, (2) the drive frequency to ensure a\u00a0$180^\\circ$ conditional phase accumulation, and (3-4) the single-qubit phases accumulated on each fluxonium during the gate.\nThese single-qubit phase corrections can be conveniently implemented through virtual-Z gates by adjusting the phases of subsequent single-qubit gates\u00a0[McKay, David C, Wood, Christopher J, Sheldon, Sarah, Chow, Jerry M, Gambetta, Jay M, \"Efficient Z gates for quantum computing\", 2017].\nAfter calibration, we extract the gate fidelity by performing Clifford interleaved randomized benchmarking, averaging over 20 different randomizations\u00a0[C\u00f3rcoles, Antonio D, Gambetta, Jay M, Chow, Jerry M, Smolin, John A, Ware, Matthew, Strand, Joel, Plourde, Britton LT, Steffen, Matthias, \"Process verification of two-qubit quantum gates by randomized benchmarking\", 2013] [Magesan, Easwar, Gambetta, Jay M, Johnson, Blake R, Ryan, Colm A, Chow, Jerry M, Merkel, Seth T, Da Silva, Marcus P, Keefe, George A, Rothwell, Mary B, Ohki, Thomas A, others, \"Efficient measurement of quantum gate error by interleaved randomized benchmarking\", 2012] [Barends, Rami, Kelly, Julian, Megrant, Anthony, Veitia, Andrzej, Sank, Daniel, Jeffrey, Evan, White, Ted C, Mutus, Josh, Fowler, Austin G, Campbell, Brooks, others, \"Superconducting quantum circuits at the surface code threshold for fault tolerance\", 2014].\nSimilar to our single-qubit Clifford decomposition, we generated the two-qubit Clifford group with the gate set\n${\\{I,\\, \\pm X,\\, \\pm Y,\\, \\pm X_{\\pi/2},\\, \\pm Y_{\\pi/2},\\, \\text{CZ}\\}}$, yielding an average of 8.25 single-qubit gates and 1.5 CZ gates per Clifford.\nA more detailed gate calibration and characterization description can be found in appendix:two_qubit.\n\nGate vs. Flux\nThe FTF approach offers a potential solution to frequency-crowding by allowing for an adjustable gate operation frequency.\nTo demonstrate this frequency-flexibility in our device, we linearly sampled the coupler flux\u00a0$\\Phi_\\text{ext,c}$ at 21 values between\u00a0$\\SI{0.5}{\\Phi_0}$ and\u00a0$\\SI{1}{\\Phi_0}$ and calibrated a CZ gate across all three transitions in fig:map_speca while maintaining a constant 100ns pulse length [fig:map_specc].\nEach data point in fig:map_specc represents a fully automated re-calibration of all single- and two-qubit gate parameters without manual fine-tuning.\nMissing points indicate either failed calibrations or fidelities lower than\u00a0$98.9\\%$, which may be caused by TLS or nearly resonant unwanted transitions (see appendix:rb_vs_flux for further details).\nWhile these fidelities remain unoptimized over the pulse width, they indicate the ease and robustness of the tuneup, as well as the accessibility of state-of-the-art gate fidelities at a variety of drive frequencies.\nWe further emphasize this by including fidelities from Device B, a second fully characterized device with similar performance. While designed to be nominally identical, the non-computational states in Device B differ by up to 300MHz from Device A, with no significant detriment to the gate fidelities (see appendix:other_device for additional characterization of Device B).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nOptimizing the CZ gate fidelity via reinforcement learning. a Gate fidelities as a function of the width of the cosine pulse envelope, averaged over 20 randomizations.

After each epoch, the measurement results were used to update the agent's policy according to the PPO algorithm.\nc In a full training run, the agent was first seeded with a 50ns cosine pulse, with an amplitude determined by a physics-calibrated 60ns gate (black diamond) but scaled by 60/50.  Then, the agent was trained to optimize the sequence fidelity of the 50ns pulse (b).

The purple circle at 28 Cliffords indicates the sequence length used for learning. All uncertainties in this figure correspond to the standard error of the mean.\n\nRB vs pulse width\nTo investigate the trade-off between coherent and incoherent error, we characterized the gate fidelity as a function of the pulse width.\nIn general, all fidelities in fig:map_specc may be improved by optimizing over this pulse width, with our highest fidelity gates using the\u00a0${\\ket{101}\\leftrightarrow \\ket{102}}$ transition at\u00a0$\\Phi_\\text{ext,c} = 0.575 \\Phi_0$ [fig:fidelitiesa].\nAt the observed optimal gate time of 85ns for this transition, we benchmarked a CZ fidelity of\u00a0${99.89\\%\\pm0.02\\%}$.\nFor longer gate durations, the gate error is dominated by the lifetime of the driven non-computational state, measured to be around 10s at this transition and, in general, varied from\u00a0$5-\\SI{20}{\\micro s}$ across all transitions in fig:map_speca.\nThe coherence times of the computational states also reduce the fidelity, but for our devices this error is negligible compared to the\u00a0$T_1$ of the non-computational state (see appendix:error for an analytic error model of this gate process).\nAt shorter gate lengths, coherent leakage into non-computational levels dominates the error, but due to the extreme degree of hybridization of the non-computational states and their subpar readout, we were not able to experimentally measure the location of the leaked population.\n\nReinforcement Learning\nTo further improve the gate fidelity, we deployed a model-free reinforcement learning agent\u00a0[John Schulman and\nFilip Wolski and\nPrafulla Dhariwal and\nAlec Radford and\nOleg Klimov, \"Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms\", 2017] [An, Zheng, Zhou, DL, \"Deep reinforcement learning for quantum gate control\", 2019] [Niu, Murphy Yuezhen, Boixo, Sergio, Smelyanskiy, Vadim N, Neven, Hartmut, \"Universal quantum control through deep reinforcement learning\", 2019] [Wang, Zhikang T., Ashida, Yuto, Ueda, Masahito, \"Deep Reinforcement Learning Control of Quantum Cartpoles\", 2020], closely following the protocol described by Sivak et al.\u00a0[Sivak, V. V., Eickbusch, A., Liu, H., Royer, B., Tsioutsios, I., Devoret, M. H., \"Model-Free Quantum Control with Reinforcement Learning\", 2022].\nWhile reinforcement learning could not mitigate the incoherent errors dominating the gate at longer pulse widths, at shorter gate times ($<$70ns) we found that it did offer an improvement via fine adjustments of the pulse parameters.\nTo train the agent, we first seeded it with a physics-based pulse calibration with a pulse width of 60ns; our physics-based calibration failed at gate times less than this.\nThen, with a fixed CZ pulse width of 50ns, the agent was trained to maximize the sequence fidelity of interleaved randomized benchmarking at 28 Cliffords with a fixed random seed by optimizing the pulse shape and virtual-Z gates\u00a0[fig:fidelitiesb].\nAfter each round of training, the optimized pulse was repeatedly evaluated by\nperforming interleaved randomized benchmarking over 70 total Clifford sequences\u00a0[fig:fidelitiesc].\nTraining was then repeated using the optimized pulse shape from the previous training round as the seed for the next.\nFor the training run shown in\u00a0fig:fidelitiesc, the fidelity peaked after the second round of training (orange points), with a time-averaged value of $99.922\\pm0.009\\%$.\nA Wilcoxon signed-rank test gives 97\nAs the run progressed, the average fidelity was observed to degrade.\nWe hypothesize that this was due to system drifts beyond what the agent was able to mitigate.\n\nIn the data shown in fig:fidelitiesb-e, the agent was given full control of the $I$ and $Q$ quadratures of the pulse envelope as well as the single-qubit virtual-Z rotation angles.\n$I(t)$ and $Q(t)$ were discretized into six points equally spaced in time [fig:fidelitiesd] with a cubic interpolation determining the remaining points.\nPerhaps the most distinctive feature of the learned pulse is the shape of $Q(t)$: while the agent was seeded with $Q(t) = 0$, the learned pulse shape displays a distinct oscillation in $Q(t)$.\nAlthough we do not fully understand the origin of this oscillation, some intuition may be gained by examining the Fourier transform of the pulse shape [fig:fidelitiesd inset].\nIn the frequency domain, the oscillation in $Q(t)$ results in a distinct asymmetry of the pulse shape: at positive detunings from the carrier frequency, the spectral weight is suppressed, and vice versa for negative detunings.\nWe hypothesize that this learned pulse asymmetry mitigates the effects of the nearest undesired transition, which is detuned by $\\sim$+65MHz at this bias point.\nHowever, we also note that attempts to mitigate the effects of this undesired transition using more established pulse shaping techniques did not improve the gate fidelity\u00a0[Motzoi, F., Gambetta, J.

In Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) the asymmetry is quantified by $\\mathbf{Im}\\left\\{\\hat{Q}_e^{-1} \\right\\}$ and one can think of the asymmetry as coming from a complex loading of the resonator. In Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) the asymmetry is quantified by $\\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the rotation angle of the resonance circle around the off-resonance point (see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)). And finally in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) the asymmetry is quantified by $\\delta \\omega$, where $\\delta\\omega=\\omega_1-\\omega_0$ is the frequency shift of the in-phase point on the resonance circle from $\\omega_0$ to $\\omega_1$ (see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)).

It corresponds to rotating the resonance circle back an angle $\\phi$, thereby putting $\\omega_0$ on the in-phase axis. This is the $\\phi$ rotation method ($\\phi$RM), and the rotation of the $\\phi$RM can best be seen by examining the difference between Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(a) and Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(b)($\\bigtriangleup$). However, simply rotating the resonance circle by angle $\\phi$ does not take into account the fact that the asymmetry has also caused the circle to grow by a factor of $1/\\cos(\\phi)$, assuming the circle has been normalized to full transmission off resonance $(S_{21}(\\omega<<\\omega_0)=S_{21}(\\omega>>\\omega_0)=1)$. We have shown here that instead one has\n$$\n\n\\frac{1}{Q_{i,\\ DCM}}=\\frac{1}{Q}-\\frac{1}{Q_e}.\n\\label{eq:Qi_right}\n\n$$\nWe call this the Diameter Correction Method (DCM) because in addition to rotating the circle by the asymmetry angle, $\\phi$, it also corrects the diameter by accounting for the complex $Q_e$. This can be seen by examining the difference between Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(a) and Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(b)($\\square$). Another interpretation of this result is that the quantity that remains constant in the asymmetry transformation is not the diameter of the resonance circle, as the $\\phi$RM assumes, but rather the distance between the in-phase axis intercepts, shown in bold in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle). That invariant length is the diameter of the circle for a symmetric resonance and becomes a chord of the circle as asymmetry is added, but remains equal to $Q/Q_e$, while the diameter grows as $Q/|\\hat{Q}_e|$. The analytical discrepancy between the two methods can simply be determined by subtracting Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) from Eq.\u00a0(<ref>),\n$$\n\n\\frac{1}{Q_{i,\\ DCM}}-\\frac{1}{Q_{i,\\ \\phi RM}}=\\left|\\frac1{\\hat{Q}_e}\\right|\\left(\\cos(\\phi)-1\\right).\n\\label{eq:Qi_right_wrong_diff}\n\n$$\nFrom Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) we see that the error in the $\\phi$RM diverges for high asymmetry angle, $\\phi \\approx \\pm \\pi$, and for low $Q_e$, high coupling.

In this case, the white dots represent the sampled points. (c) The sampled traces are post-processed and after some algebra, the sampled data points are averaged into a single point in the $(I,Q)$-plane. To extract statistics of the readout performance, i.e. single-shot readout fidelity, a large number of $(I,Q)$-records are acquired, yielding a 2D-histogram, with a Gaussian distributed spread given by the noise acting on the signal."}
{"prompt": "Explain the '# Readout optimization' section of the paper.", "completion": "Having tuned up the single qubit manipulations, we now are in the position to further optimize the readout configuration of the device. Conceptually, reading out the state of a qubit consists in entangling each one of its two states with certain states of the resonator that can be detected and distinguished at the macroscopic scale.\n\nIn cQED, the general procedure for reading out a qubit is to first entangle it with a coherent state of a readout resonator, from which the signal can quickly \u201cleak\u201d out into a coaxial cable. This signal is subsequently amplified and detected at room temperature using a heterodyne measurement technique. Such a process is typically referred to as a dispersive readout as the entanglement occurs as a result of the natural dispersive Hamiltonian.\n\nBefore going into the optimization techniques, we shall first address the question: what constitutes a good readout? In general, we care about two main properties: the measurement must be faithful and must not alter the state of the qubit. The former is quantified by the fidelity $\\mathcal{F}$, which gives the probability that we can correctly assign the qubit state based on the measurement outcome. The latter is called the quantum non-demolition-ness (QND-ness), denoted by $\\mathcal{Q}$, which gives the probability that a qubit state persists throughout the measurement process. This figure of merit is especially important when qubits are interrogated repeatedly, such as in most quantum error correction schemes.\n\nIn order to obtain both a high fidelity and QND-ness, we must carefully optimize the readout configurations. In this subsection, we will first summarize the physical process of the dispersive readout and then present the protocols to extract the key figures of merit. Finally, we will discuss some commonly used strategies for achieving an optimal readout performance."}

{"prompt": "Explain the 'Conclusions' section of the paper.", "completion": "In this paper we have presented a general technique for designing simple controls fields for single qubit unitary operations in weakly non-linear oscillators, which we refer to as the DRAG  (Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate) technique.  We first consider a qubit formed by the two lowest levels of an anharmonic oscillator with only the one photon transition elements being non-zero. In this system, the largest source of error for fast gates (small gate times) is leakage from the $\\ket{1}$ state to the $\\ket{2}$ state. Our technique provides a simple control methodology that perturbatively removes this error, thereby allowing high fidelity single qubit gates. The essential idea of this method is to apply a $y$-field that is proportional to the derivative of the original control pulse.  It contains the DRAG solution presented in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] as well as a large collection of control pulses that also correct for this leakage error, which, for example, require fewer control fields.  The lowest error obtained requires this derivative correction as well as a frequency shift.  Furthermore, we show that this methodology can be easily extended to other weakly non-linear oscillators with more then one leakage transition.\n\nIn this paper, we considered Gaussian pulses due to their favorable spectral properties, however, our theory is independent of the initial form of the pulse shape.  A future research direction could be to find the optimal pulse shape for the leakage problem.  Furthermore, while the pulses found here are robust to first order in variations in the control parameters it would be interesting to search for pulses with higher order robustness properties.\n\nWe acknowledge, E.

This, for\nexample, occurs for the phase qubit when it is driven by a time-varying\nbias current [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and the transmon when it is driven by time-varying gate voltage [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Essentially, these systems are very nearly harmonic oscillators and the controls are almost proportional to the quadrature operator.\n\nIn the cavity or circuit QED\narchitecture, the anharmonic oscillator is coupled to a resonator and is control by driving the resonator far off-resonance. In this case, $\\lambda_j$ can take on essentially any value. To see this, we start by writing the full Hamiltonian for the multi-level anharmonic oscillator and resonator as\n$$\n\\label{eq:JC}\n\\begin{split}\nH_\\mathrm{JC} =& \\omega_r a^\\dagger a + \\sum_{j=1}^{d-1}(j\\omega+\\Delta_j)\\Pi_j \\\\&+ \\sum_{j=1}^{d-1} g_{j-1,j}\\left( \\ket{j-1}\\bra{j}a^\\dagger+\\ket{j}\\bra{j-1}a\\right),\n\\end{split}\n\n$$ again $\\Delta_0=\\Delta_1=0$. This is a generalized Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] with $\\omega_r$ being the resonator frequency, and $g_{j,k}$ being the vacuum Rabi coupling for the $j$ to $k$ levels. Again we have assumed that the anharmonic oscillator only allows one photon transitions.\n\nIf $|\\omega'_{j-1,j}-\\omega_r|\\gg |g_{j-1,j}|$ for all $j$ where $\\omega'_{j-1,j}=\\omega+\\Delta_j-\\Delta_{j-1}$ then diagonalization of Eq. (<ref>) can be performed to lowest order in $g_{j-1,j}/(\\tilde\\omega_{j-1,j}-\\omega_r)$ by the canonical transformation $H_\\mathrm{JC}^\\mathrm{D}= D^\\dagger H_\\mathrm{JC} D$ where\n$$\n\\label{eq:D}D=\\exp\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{d-1} \\frac{g_{j-1,j}}{\\omega'_{j-1,j}-\\omega_r}( a^\\dagger \\ket{j-1}\\bra{j}-a \\ket{j}\\bra{j-1})\\right]\n$$  to give\n$$\n\n\\begin{split}\nH_\\mathrm{JC}^D=&(\\omega_r-\\chi_{01}) a^\\dagger a + \\sum_{j=1}^{d-1}\\left(j\\omega+\\Delta_j+\\chi_{j-1,j}\\right)\\Pi_j\\\\&+\\sum_{j=1}^{d-1}(\\chi_{0,1}+\\chi_{j-1,j}-\\chi_{j,j+1})a^\\dagger a\\Pi_j.\n\\end{split}\\label{eq:HJCD}\n\n$$ Here $\\chi_{j-1,j}={g_{j-1,j}^2}/{(\\omega'_{j-1,j}-\\omega_r)}$ is the Lamb shift induced on the  anharmonic oscillator by the resonator and the last term in Eq. (<ref>) is the ac-Stark shift [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].  Assuming that the dressed cavity is in vacuum  then Eq. (<ref>) is well approximated by Eq. (<ref>) with\n$$\n\\label{eqs:replace}\n\\omega&\\rightarrow&\\tilde\\omega=\\omega+\\chi_{0,1}\\\\\n\\Delta_j&\\rightarrow&\\tilde\\Delta_j=\\Delta_j+\\chi_{j-1,j}-j\\chi_{0,1}\n\n$$ and the tilde implies dressed values for the transition frequency and anharmonicity from the resonator.\n\nAs stated above, the control is usually through the resonator and is represented by the Hamiltonian\n$$\nH_\\mathrm{dr}(t)=\\varepsilon(t)(a+a^\\dagger)\n$$ which under the transformation Eq. (<ref>) becomes\n$$\nH^D_\\mathrm{dr}(t)=\\varepsilon(t)\\left(a+a^\\dagger + \\sum_{j=1}^{d-1} \\frac{g_{j-1,j}}{\\omega'_{j-1,j}-\\omega_r}\\sigma_{j-1,j}^x\\right). \\label{eq:Hdr}\n$$ Assuming that $\\varepsilon(t)$ is a sinusoidal with a  frequency close to the qubit then Eq. (<ref>) is well approximated by Eq. (<ref>) with\n$$\n\n\\mathcal{E}(t)&=&\\frac{g_{0,1}}{\\omega'_{0,1}-\\omega_r}\\varepsilon(t)\\\\\n\\lambda_{j-1}&=&\\frac{g_{j-1,j}(\\omega'_{0,1}-\\omega_r)}{g_{0,1}(\\omega'_{j-1,j}-\\omega_r)}.\\label{eq:lambda}\n\n$$\n\nTo demonstrate the functional form of $\\lambda_1$, we will assume the anharmonic oscillator is in the SNO limit; $\\omega'_{j-1,j}=\\omega+(j-1)\\Delta_2$, and $g_{j-1,j}=\\sqrt{j}g_{0,1}$. In this case, Eq. (<ref>) becomes\n$$\n\\label{eq:lambdaSNO}\n\\lambda_{j-1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{j}}{1+(j-1)\\Delta_2/(\\omega-\\omega_r)},\n$$ and is plotted in In Fig. (Figure fig:Lambda) as a function of the bare anharmonicity in units of $(\\omega-\\omega_r)$. Here, it is clearly seen that $\\lambda_1$ is of not equal to $\\sqrt{2}$ and actually changes sign at the point ($\\omega-\\omega_r=-\\Delta_2$). This point invalidates the diagonalization for the second level and can not be treated under this model. Away from this point the values obtained from this model approximate the real situation. This was confirmed in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] where the experimental value for $\\lambda_1$ for the operation point used was found to agree with Eq. (<ref>). However, we propose that $\\lambda_j$ should be used as a fitting parameter in any experiment as effects such as higher modes of the resonator and higher order perturbation will result in additional corrections to this value [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(color online) Ratio of coupling strength of the $\\ket{1}\\rightarrow\\ket{2}$ transition to the $\\ket{0}\\rightarrow\\ket{1}$ transition as a function of anharmonicity for control through a resonator (solid  blue) and direct drive (dashed red)."}

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Organization of this article' section of the paper.", "completion": "This review is organized in the following four sections; first, in Sec. <ref>, we explore the parameter space available when designing superconducting circuits. In particular, we look at the promising capacitively-shunted planar qubit modalities and how these can be engineered with desired properties, such as transition frequency, anharmonicity, and reduced susceptibility to various sources of noise. In this section, we also introduce several ways in which interactions between qubits can be engineered, in order to implement two-qubit entangling operations, needed for a universal gate set.\n\nIn Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we discuss systematic and stochastic noise, the concepts of noise strength and qubit noise susceptibility, and the common sources of noise which lead to decoherence in superconducting circuits. We introduce the Bloch-Redfield model of decoherence, characterized by longitudinal and transverse relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$, and discuss the implications of $1/f$ noise. We then define the noise power spectral density, which is commonly used to characterize noise processes, and describe how it drives decoherence. Finally, we close the section with a review of coherent control methods used to mitigate certain types of coherence, reversible noise.\n\nIn Sec. <ref>, we provide a review of how single- and two-qubit operations are typically implemented in superconducing circuits, by using a combination of local magnetic flux control and microwave drives. In particular, we discuss the family of two-qubit gates arising from a capacitive coupling between qubits, and introduce several recent advances that have been demonstrated to achieve high-fidelity gates, as well as applications in quantum information processing that use these gates. The continued development of high-fidelity two-qubit gates in superconducting qubits is a highly active research area. For this reason, we include sufficient technical details that a reader may use this review as a starting point to critically assess the pros and cons of the various gates, as well as develop an appreciation for the types of gate-engineering already implemented in state-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors.\n\nFinally, in Sec. <ref>, we discuss the physics and engineering associated with the dispersive readout technique, typically used to measure the individual qubit states in modern quantum processors. After a discussion of the theory behind dispersive coupling, we give an introduction to design of Purcell filters and the development of quantum-limited parametric amplifiers.\n\nENGINEERING QUANTUM CIRCUITS\n\nIn this section, we will demonstrate how quantum systems based on superconducting circuits can be engineered to achieve certain desired properties. Using the most common qubit modalities, we discuss how properties such as the qubit transition frequency, anharmonicity, and noise susceptibility can be tailored by the choice of circuit topology and element parameter values. We also discuss how to engineer the interactions between different quantum systems, in particular the cases of qubit-qubit and qubit-resonator couplings.\n\nFrom quantum harmonic oscillator to the transmon qubit\n\nA quantum mechanical system is governed by the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation,\n$$\n\n\\hat{H} \\vert \\psi(t) \\rangle = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\vert \\psi(t) \\rangle,\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\vert \\psi(t) \\rangle$ is the state of the quantum system at time $t$, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant $h/2\\pi$, and $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian that describes the total energy of the system. The \u201chat\" is used to indicate that $\\hat{H}$ is a quantum operator. As the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a first-order linear differential equation, the temporal dynamics of the quantum system may be viewed as a straightforward example of a linear dynamical system with formal solution,\n\n$$\n\n\\vert \\psi(t) \\rangle = e^{-i \\hat{H} t / \\hbar} \\vert \\psi(0) \\rangle.\n\n$$\n\nThe time-independent Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$ governs the time evolution of the system through the operator $e^{-i \\hat{H} t / \\hbar}$. Thus, just as with classical systems, determining the Hamiltonian of a system \u2013 whether the classical Hamiltonian $H$ or its quantum counterpart $\\hat{H}$ \u2013 is the first step to deriving its dynamical behavior. In Sec. <ref>, we consider the case when the Hamiltonian is time-dependent in the context of qubit control.\n\nTo understand the dynamics of a superconducting qubit circuit, it is natural to start with the classical description of a linear LC resonant circuit [Fig. <ref>(a)]. In this system, energy oscillates between electrical energy in the capacitor $C$ and magnetic energy in the inductor $L$. In the following, we will arbitrarily associate the electrical energy with the \u201ckinetic energy\u201d and the magnetic energy with the \u201cpotential energy\u201d of the oscillator. The instantaneous, time-dependent energy in each element is derived from its current and voltage,\n\n$$\n\nE(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} V(t')I(t')dt',\n\\label{Eq:ElementEnergy}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $V(t')$ and $I(t')$ denote the voltage and current of the capacitor or inductor.\n\nTo derive the classical Hamiltonian, we follow the standard approach used in classical mechanics: the Lagrange-Hamilton formulation. Here, we represent the circuit elements in terms of one of its generalized circuit coordinates, charge or flux. In the following, we pick flux, defined as the time integral of the voltage\n\n$$\n\n\\Phi(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} V(t')dt'.\n\\label{Eq:NodeFlux}\n\n$$\n\nIn this example, the voltage at the node is also the branch voltage across the element. In this section, we will simply refer to these as node voltages and fluxes for convenience. For a more detailed discussion of nodes and branches in this context, we refer the reader to Ref.\u00a0Devoret1997.\n\nNote that in the following, we could have exchanged our associations with kinetic energy (momentum coordinate) and potential energy (position coordinate), and instead start with the charge variable $Q(t)$, which is the time integral of the current $I(t)$.\n\nBy combining Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>), using the relations $V=L \\; dI/dt$ and $I=C \\; dV/dt$, and applying the integration by parts formula, we can write down energy terms for the capacitor and inductor in terms of the node flux,\n\n$$\n\n\\mathcal{T}_C = \\frac{1}{2}C\\dot{\\Phi}^2,\n\\label{Eq:KineticEnergy}\n\n$$\n\n$$\n\n\\mathcal{U}_L = \\frac{1}{2L}\\Phi^2.\n\\label{Eq:PotentialEnergy}\n\n$$\n\nThe Lagrangian is defined as the difference between the kinetic and potential energy terms and can thus be expressed in terms of Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>)\n\n$$\n\n\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{T}_{C} - \\mathcal{U}_L = \\frac{1}{2}C\\dot{\\Phi}^2 - \\frac{1}{2L}\\Phi^2.\n\\label{Eq:Lagrangian}\n\n$$\n\nFrom the Lagrangian in Eq. (<ref>), we can further derive the Hamiltonian using the Legendre transformation, for which we need to calculate the momentum conjugate to the flux, which in this case is the charge on the capacitor\n\n$$\n\nQ = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{\\Phi}} = C\\dot{\\Phi}.\n\n$$\n\nThe Hamiltonian of the system is now defined as\n\n$$\n\nH = Q\\dot{\\Phi} - \\mathcal{L} = \\frac{Q^2}{2C} + \\frac{\\Phi^2}{2L} \\equiv\n\\frac{1}{2} C V^2 + \\frac{1}{2} L I^2,\n\\label{Eq:HamiltonianLC}\n\n$$\n\nas one would expect for an electrical LC circuit. Note that this Hamiltonian is analogous to that of a mechanical harmonic oscillator, with mass $m = C$, and resonant frequency $\\omega = 1/\\sqrt{LC}$, which expressed in position, $x$, and momentum, $p$, coordinates takes the form $H = p^2/2m + m\\omega^2 x^2/2$.\n\nThe Hamiltonian described above is classical. In order to proceed to a quantum-mechanical description of the system, we need to promote the charge and flux coordinates to quantum operators. And, whereas the classical coordinates satisfy the Poisson bracket:\n\n$$\n\n\\{f,g\\}\n&= \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta \\Phi} \\frac{\\delta g}{\\delta Q} - \\frac{\\delta g}{\\delta \\Phi} \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta Q} \\\\\n\\rightarrow \\{\\Phi,Q\\}  &= \\frac{\\delta \\Phi}{\\delta \\Phi} \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta Q} - \\frac{\\delta Q}{\\delta \\Phi} \\frac{\\delta \\Phi}{\\delta Q} = 1-0 = 1,\n\n$$\n\nthe quantum operators similarly satisfy a commutation relation:\n\n$$\n\n[\\hat{\\Phi},\\hat{Q}] = \\hat{\\Phi}\\hat{Q} - \\hat{Q}\\hat{\\Phi} = i\\hbar,\n\\label{Eq:CommutationRelationPhiq}\n\n$$\n\nwhere the operators are indicated by hats. From this point forward, however, the hats on operators will be omitted for simplicity.\n\nIn a simple LC resonant circuit [Fig. <ref>(a)], both the inductor $L$ and the capacitor $C$ are linear circuit elements. Defining the reduced flux $\\phi \\equiv 2 \\pi \\Phi / \\Phi_0$ and the reduced charge $n=Q/2e$, we can write down the following quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian for the circuit,\n\n$$\n\nH = 4E_C n^2 + \\frac{1}{2}E_L \\phi^2,\n\\label{Eq:Hqho}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $E_C = e^2/(2C)$ is the charging energy required to add each electron of the Cooper-pair to the island and $E_L = (\\Phi_0/2\\pi)^2/L$ is the inductive energy, where $\\Phi_0 = h/(2e)$ is the superconducting magnetic flux quantum. Moreover, the quantum operator $n$ is the excess number of Cooper-pairs on the island, and $\\phi$ \u2013 the reduced flux \u2013 is denoted the \u201cgauge-invariant phase\u201d across the inductor. These two operators form a canonical conjugate pair, obeying the commutation relation $[\\phi,n] = i$. We note that the factor 4 in front of the charging energy $E_C$ is solely a historical artifact, namely, that this energy scale was first defined for single-electron systems and then adopted to two-electron Cooper-pair systems.\n\nThe Hamiltonian in Eq.$\\,$(<ref>) is identical to the one describing a particle in a one-dimensional quadratic potential, a quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO). We can treat $\\phi$ as the generalized position coordinate, so that the first term is the kinetic energy and the second term is the potential energy. We emphasize that the functional form of the potential energy influences the eigensolutions. For example, the fact that this term is quadratic ($U_L \\propto \\phi^2$) in Eq. (<ref>) gives rise to the shape of the potential in Fig. <ref>(b). The solution to this eigenvalue problem gives an infinite series of eigenstates $|k\\rangle$, ($k = 0,1,2,\\ldots$), whose corresponding eigenenergies $E_k$ are all equidistantly spaced, i.e. $E_{k+1} - E_k = \\hbar \\omega_r$, where $\\omega_r = \\sqrt{8 E_L E_C}/\\hbar = 1/\\sqrt{L C}$ denotes the resonant frequency of the system, see Fig. <ref>(b). We may represent these results in a more compact form (second quantization) for the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) Hamiltonian\n\n$$\n\nH = \\hbar\\omega_{r}\\left( a^{\\dagger}a + \\frac{1}{2}\\right),\n\\label{Eq:HqhoSQ}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $a^{\\dagger}(a)$ is the creation (annihilation) operator of a single excitation of the resonator. The Hamiltonian in Eq. (<ref>) is written as an energy. It is, however, often preferred to divide by $\\hbar$ so that the expression has units of radian frequency, since we will later resonantly drive transitions at a particular frequency or reference the rate at which two systems interact with one another. Therefore, from here on, $\\hbar$ will be omitted.\n\nThe original charge number and phase operators can be expressed as $n = n_{\\text{zpf}}\\times i(a - a^{\\dagger})$ and $\\phi = \\phi_{\\text{zpf}} \\times (a + a^{\\dagger})$, where $n_{\\text{zpf}} = [E_L/(32E_C)]^{1/4}$ and $\\phi_{\\text{zpf}} = (2E_C/E_L)^{1/4}$ are the zero-point fluctuations of the charge and phase variables, respectively. Quantum mechanically, the quantum states are represented as wavefunctions that are generally distributed over a range of values of $n$ and $\\phi$ and, consequently, the wavefunctions have non-zero standard deviations. Such wavefunction distributions are referred to as \u201cquantum fluctuations,\u201d and they exist, even in the ground state, where they are called \u201czero-point fluctuations\u201d.\n\nThe linear characteristics of the QHO has a natural limitation in its applications for processing quantum information. Before the system can be used as a qubit, we need to be able to define a computational subspace consisting of only two energy states (usually the two-lowest energy eigenstates) in between which transitions can be driven without also exciting other levels in the system. Since many gate operations, such as single-qubit gates (Sec. <ref>), depend on frequency selectivity, the equidistant level-spacing of the QHO, illustrated in Fig. <ref>(b), poses a practical limitation[Even though linear resonant systems cannot be addressed properly, their long coherence times have proven them useful as quantum access memories for storing quantum information, where a nonlinear ancilla system is used as a quantum controller for feeding and extracting excitations to/from the resonant cavity modes[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(a) Circuit for a parallel LC-oscillator (quantum harmonic oscillator, QHO), with inductance $L$ in parallel with capacitance, $C$. The superconducting phase on the island is denoted $\\phi$, referencing ground as zero. (b) Energy potential for the QHO, where energy levels are equidistantly spaced $\\hbar \\omega_{r}$ apart. (c) Josephson qubit circuit, where the nonlinear inductance $L_J$ (represented with the Josephson-subcircuit in the dashed orange box) is shunted by a capacitance, $C_s$. (d) The Josephson inductance reshapes the quadratic energy potential (dashed red) into sinusoidal (solid blue), which yields non-equidistant energy levels. This allows us to isolate the two lowest energy levels $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$, forming a computational subspace with an energy separation $\\hbar\\omega_{01}$, which is different than $\\hbar\\omega_{12}$.\n\nTo mitigate the problem of unwanted dynamics involving non-computational states, we need to add anharmonicity (or nonlinearity) into our system. In short, we require the transition frequencies $\\omega_{\\text{q}}^{0\\rightarrow 1}$ and $\\omega_{\\text{q}}^{1\\rightarrow 2}$ be sufficiently different to be individually adressable. In general, the larger the anharmonicity the better. In practise, the amount of anharmonicity sets a limit on how short the pulses used to drive the qubit can be. This is discussed in detail in Sec. <ref>.\n\nTo introduce the nonlinearity required to modify the harmonic potential, we use the Josephson junction \u2013 a nonlinear, dissipationless circuit element that forms the backbone in superconducting circuits[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. By replacing the linear inductor of the QHO with a Josephson junction, playing the role of a nonlinear inductor, we can modify the functional form of the potential energy. The potential energy of the Josephson junction can be derived from Eq. (<ref>) and the two Josephson relations\n\n$$\n\nI = I_c \\sin (\\phi), \\hspace{0.5cm}V = \\frac{\\hbar}{2e} \\frac{d\\phi}{dt},\n\\label{Eq:JosephsonRelations}\n\n$$\n\nresulting in a modified Hamiltonian\n\n$$\n\nH = 4E_C n^2 - E_J \\cos(\\phi),\n\\label{Eq:HTransmon}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $E_C = e^2/(2C_{\\Sigma})$, $C_{\\Sigma} = C_s + C_J$ is the total capacitance, including both shunt capacitance $C_s$ and the self-capacitance of the junction $C_J$, and $E_J = I_c \\Phi_0/2\\pi$ is the Josephson energy, with $I_c$ being the critical current of the junction[The critical current is the maximum supercurrent that the junction can support before it switches to the resistive state with non-zero voltage.]. After introducing the Josephson junction in the circuit, the potential energy no longer takes a manifestly parabolic form (from which the harmonic spectrum originates), but rather features a cosinusoidal form, see the second term in Eq. (<ref>), which makes the energy spectrum non-degenerate. Therefore, the Josephson junction is the key ingredient that makes the oscillator anharmonic and thus allows us to identify a uniquely addressable quantum two-level system, see Fig. <ref>(d).\n\nOnce the nonlinearity has been added, the system dynamics is governed by the dominant energy in Eq. (<ref>), reflected in the $E_J/E_C$ ratio. Over time, the superconducting qubit community has converged towards circuit designs with $E_J \\gg E_C$. In the opposite case when $E_J \\leq E_C$, the qubit becomes highly sensitive to charge noise, which has proven more challenging to mitigate than flux noise, making it very hard to achieve high coherence. Another motivation is that current technologies allow for more flexibility in engineering the inductive (or potential) part of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, working in the $E_J \\leq E_C$ limit, makes the system more sensitive to the change in the potential Hamiltonian. Therefore, we will focus here on the state-of-the-art qubit modalities that fall in the regime $E_J \\gg E_C$. For readers who are interested in the physics in the $E_J \\leq E_C$ regime, such as the earlier Cooper-pair box charge qubit, we refer to Refs. Nakamura1999,Vion2002,You2003,Duty2004.\n\nTo access the $E_J \\gg E_C$ regime, one preferred approach is to make the charging $E_C$ small by shunting the junction with a large capacitor, $C_s \\gg C_J$, effectively making the qubit less sensitive to charge noise \u2013 a circuit commonly known as the transmon qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In this limit, the superconducting phase $\\phi$ is a good quantum number, i.e. the spread (or quantum fluctuation) of $\\phi$ values represented by the quantum wavefunction is small. The low-energy eigenstates are therefore, to a good approximation, localized states in the potential well, see Fig. <ref>(d). We may gain more insight by expanding the potential term of Eq. (<ref>) into a power series (since $\\phi$ is small), that is\n\n$$\n\nE_J \\cos(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2}E_J \\phi^2 - \\frac{1}{24}E_J \\phi^4 + \\mathcal{O}(\\phi^6).\n\\label{Eq:EJexpansion}\n\n$$\n\nThe leading quadratic term in Eq. (<ref>) alone will result in a QHO, recall Eq. (<ref>). The second term, however, is quartic which modifies the eigensolution and disrupts the otherwise harmonic energy structure. Note that, the negative coefficient of the quartic term indicates that the anharmonicity $\\alpha = \\omega_{\\text{q}}^{1\\rightarrow 2} - \\omega_{\\text{q}}^{0\\rightarrow 1}$ is negative and its limit in magnitude thus cannot be made arbitrarily large. For the case of the transmon, $\\alpha = - E_C$ is usually designed to be $100 - 300\\,$MHz, as required to maintain a desirable qubit frequency $\\freq = (\\sqrt{8 E_J E_C} - E_C)/\\hbar = 3-6\\,$GHz, while keeping an energy ratio sufficiently large ($E_J/E_C \\geq 50$) to suppress charge sensitivity[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Fortunately, the charge sensitivity is exponentially suppressed for increased $E_J/E_C$, while the reduction in anharmonicity only scales as a weak power law, leading to a workable device.\n\nIncluding terms up to fourth order and using the QHO eigenbases, the system Hamiltonian resembles that of a Duffing oscillator\n\n$$\n\nH = \\freq a^{\\dagger}a + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}a^{\\dagger}a^{\\dagger}aa.\n\\label{Eq:HDuffing}\n\n$$\n\nSince $|\\alpha| \\ll \\freq$, we can see that the transmon qubit is basically a weakly anharmonic oscillator (AHO). If excitation to higher non-computational states is suppressed over any gate operations, either due to a large enough  $|\\alpha|$ or due to robust control techniques such as the DRAG pulse, see Sec. <ref>, we may effectively treat the AHO as a quantum two-level system, simplifying the Hamiltonian to\n\n$$\n\nH = \\freq \\frac{\\sigma_{z}}{2},\n\\label{Eq:HTwoLevelSystem}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma_{z}$ is the Pauli-z operator. However, one should always keep in mind that the higher levels physically exist[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Their influence on system dynamics should be taken into account when designing the system and its control processes. In fact, there are many cases where the higher levels have proven useful to implement more efficient gate operations[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn addition to reducing the charge dispersion, the use of a large shunt capacitor also enables us to engineer the electric field distribution of the quantum system, and thus the participation of surface loss mechanisms. In the development of the 3D transmon[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], e.g. a 2D transmon coupled to a 3D cavity, it was demonstrated that by making the gap between the two lateral capacitor plates large (compared to the film thickness) the coherence time increases since a smaller portion of the electric field interacts with the lossy interfaces, e.g. metal-substrate and substrate-vacuum interfaces, which has been studied extensively[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nModular qubit circuit representations for capacitively shunted qubit modalities (orange box Fig. <ref>c) and corresponding qubit transition frequencies for the two lowest energy states as a function of applied magnetic flux in units of $\\Phi_0$.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# The dispersive coupling' section of the paper.", "completion": "Having introduced the two key components of cQED systems, superconducting resonators and transmons, we now look into how they can be integrated to form a useful quantum device.\n\nPhysically, when a transmon is placed in proximity to a resonator, the charges of one element can influence those of the other through a coupling capacitor (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:dispersive_coupling)(c)). We summarize this coupling by a parameter of the Hamiltonian, $g_0$, which can be computed exactly for a given model of the circuit. This leads to an interaction Hamiltonian\n$$\n\n\\bH_{\\text{int}} &= g_0\\bn_R \\bn_T \\\\\n&= -g \\left(\\ba^\\dag - \\ba\\right)\\left(\\bq^\\dag - \\bq\\right)\n\n$$\nwith the subscripts $T$ and $R$ describing the transmon and the resonator respectively. Note that we have regrouped the charge zero-point fluctuations in $g$.\n\nThe exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian with this interaction is done in many reviews\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Here, we present an approximate diagonalization in the most commonly-used parameter regime in cQED, where:\n\n1) $g\\ll|\\Delta|=|\\omega_T - \\omega_R|$, with large qubit-cavity detuning giving rise to a dispersive interaction between the two elements instead of resonant energy exchange;\n\n2) $E_C \\ll |\\Delta|$ (weak anharmonicity);\n\n3) $|\\Delta| \\ll \\omega_T + \\omega_R$, implying that the counter-rotating terms are negligible.\n\nIn this regime, we apply the Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA) to reduce the interaction Hamiltonian to $\\bH_{\\text{int}}/\\hbar = g\\left(\\ba\\bq^\\dag + \\ba^\\dag\\bq\\right)$.\n\nFollowing this, we write a set of Langevin equations for $\\ba$ and $\\bq$ in the Heisenberg picture\n$$\n\n\\partial_t\\ba &= - i \\left(\\omega_R - i\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\right) \\ba - i g\\bq\\\\\n\\label{eq:q_langevin}\n\\partial_t\\bq &= -i \\omega_T \\bq - i g \\ba - \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left[\\bq, \\bH_{4^+}\\left(\\varphi^{ZPF}_T(\\bq + \\bq^\\dag)\\right)\\right],\n\n$$\nwhere we have included the dissipation of the resonator but neglected the dissipation of the transmon, such that we can analyze the impact of a readout cavity, typically with low or moderate Q, on the relaxation of the transmon (see Sec.<ref>3). We treat the non-linear part of Eq.\u00a0<ref> as a perturbation and diagonalize the linear part given by the matrix\n$$\n\\label{eq:dispersive_mat}\nM = \\left(\\,\n\\begin{matrix*}[c]\n~(\\omega_R - i\\kappa/2) & g~ \\\\\n~g & \\omega_T~\n\\end{matrix*}\\,\\right),\n\n$$\nwhose eigenvalues are given to the first order by\n$$\n\n\\tilde \\omega_R &= \\omega_R + \\frac{g^2}{\\Delta} - i\\frac{\\kappa}{2} + i\\left(\\frac{g}{\\Delta}\\right)^2\\kappa \\\\\n\\tilde \\omega_T &= \\omega_T - \\frac{g^2}{\\Delta} - i\\left(\\frac{g}{\\Delta}\\right)^2\\kappa.\n\n$$\nThe frequencies $\\tilde \\omega_R$ and $\\tilde \\omega_T$ of the resonator and the transmon in the dispersively coupled system are shifted with respect to the uncoupled system by the Lamb-shift\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:lamb_shift}\n\\Lambda_\\chi = g^2/\\Delta.\n\n$$\nThe transmon also inherits some dissipation from the cavity given by the Purcell rate\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:purcell_limit}\n\\Gamma_P = 2\\left(\\frac{g}{\\Delta}\\right)^2\\kappa.\n\n$$\nThe Purcell rate could lead to a trade-off between a large transmon-resonator coupling for fast operations and the lifetime of the qubit. However, in practice, the Purcell effect can be significantly suppressed with carefully designed Purcell filters\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nWe can now define a new set of annihilation and creation operators that correspond to the eigenvectors of the matrix given by Eq.\u00a0<ref>. To do so, we first define a mixing angle of $\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\arctan\\left(\\frac{2g}{\\Delta}\\right)$. With this, the new eigenstates, also called dressed modes, are given by\n$$\n\n\\tilde \\ba &= \\cos(\\theta) \\ba + \\sin(\\theta) \\bq \\approx \\ba + \\frac{g}{\\Delta}\\bq \\\\\n\\tilde \\bq &= -\\sin(\\theta)\\ba + \\cos(\\theta)\\bq \\approx -\\frac{g}{\\Delta}\\ba + \\bq.\n\n$$\nA detailed derivation can be found in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. With these relations, the linear part of the Hamiltonian is now proportional to $\\tilde \\omega_R \\tilde\\ba^\\dag\\tilde\\ba + \\tilde \\omega_T \\tilde \\bq^\\dag \\tilde \\bq$.\n\nTo treat the non-linear part of the Hamiltonian $\\bH_{4^+}$, we invert the definition of $\\tilde \\ba$ and $\\tilde \\bq$ to obtain\n$$\n\n\\varphi_T^{\\text{ZPF}}\\left(\\bq + \\bq^\\dag\\right) &=\\varphi_T^{\\text{ZPF}}\\left(\\cos(\\theta)(\\tilde\\bq + \\tilde\\bq^\\dag) + \\sin(\\theta)(\\tilde \\ba + \\tilde \\ba^\\dag)\\right) \\nonumber\\\\\n&\\approx \\varphi_T^{\\text{ZPF}}\\left(\\tilde\\bq + \\tilde\\bq^\\dag\\right) + \\varphi_T^{\\text{ZPF}}\\frac{g}{\\Delta}\\left(\\tilde \\ba + \\tilde \\ba^\\dag\\right)\n\n$$\nIt is useful to note that we often combine the ZPF terms with the associated mixing angles into a single coefficient, i.e. $\\varphi_T = \\varphi_T^{\\text{ZPF}}\\cos(\\theta)$; $\\varphi_R = \\varphi_T^{\\text{ZPF}}\\sin(\\theta)$, to describe the $(\\tilde\\bq + \\tilde\\bq^\\dag)$ and $(\\tilde\\ba + \\tilde\\ba^\\dag)$ terms. This notation is commonly adopted in the treatment of dynamics of transmon-cavity systems in cQED.\n\nWith $\\varphi_T^{ZPF} \\ll 1$, the largest elements in this non-linear Hamiltonian are of the 4th order. We can then perform the same RWA as in Eq.\u00a0<ref> to eliminate the non-resonant terms. Now working exclusively in the new frame, we drop the tilde and simplify the notation to get the transmon-cavity Hamiltonian in the dispersive regime in the following form\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:dispersive_hamiltonian}\n\\frac{\\bH}{\\hbar} =& \\omega_T \\bq^\\dag \\bq + \\omega_R \\ba^\\dag\\ba \\\\ \\nonumber&-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\bq^{\\dag 2}\\bq^2 - \\frac{K}{2}\\ba^{\\dag 2}\\ba^2 - \\chi\\left(\\bq^\\dag\\bq\\right)\\left(\\ba^\\dag\\ba\\right),\n\n$$\nwith\n$$\n\nK &= \\frac{E_J}{2} \\left(\\varphi^{\\text{ZPF}}_T\\right)^4\\left(\\frac{g}{\\Delta}\\right)^4 = E_C\\left(\\frac{g}{\\Delta}\\right)^4, \\\\\n\\chi &= E_J\\left(\\varphi^{\\text{ZPF}}_T\\right)^4\\left(\\frac{g}{\\Delta}\\right)^2 = 2 E_C\\left(\\frac{g}{\\Delta}\\right)^2. \\label{eq:chi}\n\n$$\nTypically, $K$ and $\\chi$ are referred to as the self-Kerr and the cross-Kerr non-linearity between the resonator and the transmon, respectively. Physically, we can interpret the effect of a dispersive coupling as a state-dependent frequency shift between the two modes. The coupling is considered to be in the strong dispersive regime if this state-dependent shift is larger than the linewidth of the resonator.\n\nIn practice, this type of dispersively coupled transmon-resonator system can be realized by placing them in physical proximity such that their respective fields overlap, as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:dispersive_coupling)d and (e). More details regarding the exact configuration of such devices will be discussed in Sec.\u00a0<ref>.\n\nDespite its relative simplicity, the dispersive Hamiltonian is the origin of many interesting phenomena and crucial tools in cQED. Generally, the resonator-transmon system offers us a platform with three main capabilities. First, by coupling the resonator strongly to a transmission line, we can implement fast and efficient readout of the transmon state. Alternatively, two transmons can interact via a mediating resonator mode (quantum bus) to realize quantum operations. Finally, the transmon can act as a non-linear ancilla to perform universal control on the resonator state.\n\nGoing beyond the natural interactions, the addition of microwave drives at well-chosen frequencies also offers the possibilities of engineering new dynamics in the cQED system. This capability is afforded by the non-linear frequency-mixing in the Josephson junction, akin to frequency conversion processes in non-linear optical mediums\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. To the first order, a single JJ can be used to enact four-wave mixing in cQED devices.\n\nSuch driven interactions are highly useful tools for engineering new dynamics or operations in cQED devices. One of the key applications of such driven operations is to engineer quantum-limited amplifiers, which will be discussed in Sec.\u00a0<ref>. Additionally, a wide range of different Hamiltonians have been demonstrated using such drives, enabling a large repertoire of new experimental achievements.

Since TLS loss is capacitive <cit.>, the design of the resonator's capacitor determines the TLS regions to which it is sensitive. Planar devices are sensitive to surface dielectric losses, whether they are CPW <cit.> or IDC <cit.> designs. While they are also compatible with measurements of a wide variety of subsequently-added dielectrics, only a fraction of the electric field will be stored in the added material, implying that the planar devices will have a low sensitivity to the bulk TLS loss of these deposited dielectrics. Since CPWs are also used in high performance superconducting quantum circuits for algorithm implementation, these resonators can be used as a proxy and measured in order to improve the quantum devices themselves, in addition to their use as a direct TLS measurement technique.\n\nOn the other hand, multilayer devices involving deposited dielectrics and multiple wiring layers (such as microstrip or parallel plate lumped element resonators) can concentrate fields in the thin film or bulk dielectric of interest. Multilayer resonators also have a lower participation of native surface oxides, which are difficult to control during processing and often require simulation to disentangle their loss from the loss of interest.

Dissipated power at MXC (left) and CP (right) measured as a function of current in the flux line. Solid lines are quadratic fits to the data.\n\nTo determine the active load arising from flux biasing the qubits, we terminate one of the flux lines at MXC with an electric short, apply a DC current to it, and measure the corresponding temperature increase and heat loads. While the relative temperature increases are negligibly small on the stages from room temperature to the Still, they are significant on CP and MXC. As expected we observe a quadratic increase of the extracted loads $P_{\\rm MXC/CP}=R_{\\rm eff,MXC/CP}I_{\\rm MXC}^2$ as a function of the applied current. The maximum applied current amounted to 8.8 mA at the input of the dilution refrigerator or to 4.6 mA after the 10 dB attenuator at 4K, and thus at MXC (denoted $I_{\\rm MXC}$). From quadratic fits to the data we extract $R_{\\rm eff,MXC}=0.15(1)\\,{\\rm \\Omega} = 0.15(1)\\mu{\\rm W/mA^2}$ and $R_{\\rm eff,CP}=0.42(2)\\,{\\rm \\Omega}$.\n\nThe sum of the two resistances corresponds to the resistance of a coaxial stainless steel cable with a length of 20 cm, which is a bit smaller than the cable length of 29 cm from Still to MXC.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Configuring the building blocks' section of the paper.", "completion": "The very first step in the cQED design flow is to ask the following questions: How many non-linear elements (e.g.\u00a0qubits) and linear elements (e.g.\u00a0resonators) are required to realize the desired device functionality? What are the roles, mode frequencies, tunability, and required coherence properties of each of them? What is the required connectivity of the device and how are the different elements coupled to one another?\nThese basic considerations often dictate whether the device is better (or easier) built with the planar or the 3D approach under the current technology.\n\nIn either planar or 3D cQED devices, linear modes are realized with superconducting resonators whose frequencies are dictated by the dimensions of the electromagnetic structures. While lumped-element LC resonators (with interdigitated capacitors and meandering wires) are valuable for their small footprint, the most widely-used superconducting resonators in the field are the CPW resonators for the planar approach, and variations of coaxial resonators for the 3D approach\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Physically, they are equivalent to an infinite series of LC oscillators, but usually only the fundamental mode is employed in cQED experiments. Ideally, the higher-frequency modes are sufficiently detuned from resonance frequency of interest in the system to not interfere with the intended use of the device. However, we must be aware of the existence of these modes and their potential impact on qubit coherence (e.g.\u00a0thermal shot noise dephasing\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], see Sec.\u00a0<ref>), and exercise special care to prevent spurious multi-photon transitions.\n\nCPW resonators are typically realized with a section of CPW transmission line terminated with open or short boundary conditions on the two ends. The CPW has a geometric capacitance and inductance per unit length $C_g$ and $L_g$ which can be calculated from the cross-sectional dimensions of the CPW (e.\u00a0g.\u00a0widths of the center conductor and the dielectric gap). Furthermore, the kinetic inductance of the superconducting thin film per unit length $L_k$ also influences the wavelength ($\\lambda=2\\pi/\\omega\\sqrt{C_g(L_g+L_k)}$) of the propagating wave. The value of $L_k$ depends on the cross-sectional dimensions and the material properties, but it can be estimated from the room temperature resistivity of the film. The contribution from $L_k$ is typically small but not negligible in standard planar devices.\n\nHaving taken these factors into consideration, the length of the CPW section can then be designed based on the targeted resonator frequency and the type of termination. Recall that a CPW terminated by two open ends forms a $\\lambda/2$ resonator, and a CPW terminated by an open and a short end forms a $\\lambda/4$ resonator. A typical operating frequency of $\\sim$5 GHz translates to CPW lengths on the orders of 1 cm, but the total footprint can be reduced by using meandering patterns, as depicted in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:device_2d)(b).\n\nSimilarly, the coaxial resonator can be understood as a section of coaxial transmission line terminated with open or short boundary conditions on the two ends. A $\\lambda/4$ version of the coaxial resonator can be constructed by conventional machining from a single piece of bulk superconductor (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:device_3d)(c)), eliminating the ohmic dissipation from the imperfect seams in bulk metal assembly\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This advantage leads to reliably high coherence times, which has made this type of \u201creentrant post cavity\" a go-to design for high-Q quantum memory in cQED\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. A $\\lambda/2$ version of the coaxial resonator uses a machined tube as the ground shield and an on-chip superconducting strip as the center conductor (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:device_3d)(d)), affording the flexibility of having multiple resonators, qubits and Purcel filters on the same chip with mostly lithographically defined couplings\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Again, the required length of the resonators can be estimated from the wavelengths of coaxial travelling modes at the target frequency.\n\nThe design of non-linear modes such as qubits, couplers, and parametric mixers typically begins with lumped-element approximations. The inductive circuit component is provided by the Josephson junctions, whose non-linear inductance can be easily varied via the tunnelling area of the junctions. The capacitance of the mode is tuned by adjusting the dimensions of the superconducting leads and pads ( purple-colored structures in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:device_2d)(b) and Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:device_3d)(c)).\nFor transmon qubits, the desired frequency is typically in the range of $4-8$ GHz. This frequency range is sufficiently to suppress thermal excitations at 20 mK, low enough to mitigate couplings to higher-frequency spurious package modes, and is supported by existing  high-performance and relatively cost-effective microwave electronics. Inductance and capacitance of the transmons are usually designed in the range of $6-16$ nH and $50-125$ fF (with $2-5$ fF from the tunnel barrier of the junction itself), corresponding to $E_J\\sim10-25\\,$GHz and $E_C\\sim160-400$ MHz, respectively. This range of $E_C$ is chosen to effectively suppress charge noise (which grows exponentially with $E_C$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]) while still preserving a sizeable anharmonicity $\\alpha\\approx E_C/\\hbar$ (which is crucial for fast qubit operations).\n\nNext, let us consider the necessary coupling between different elements in the device. The dispersive coupling between a transmon and a resonator, for instance, can be achieved by ensuring a sufficient overlap between their electromagnetic fields. In other words, a strong coupling, or a large $g$, can be realized if there is a high mutual capacitance between the two modes. The coupling capacitance in planar designs (such as the fork-shaped structures in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:device_3d)(c)) can be calculated either using conformal mapping techniques\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] or analytical expressions for certain specific use cases\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Alternatively, an inductive coupling can be achieved by introducing a mutual inductance between the two modes. Moreover, the magnitude of the dispersive interaction $\\chi$, depends not only on $g$ but also on the frequency detuning $\\Delta$ between the two elements (Eq.\u00a0<ref>), which can be modified by adjusting the dimensions of individual elements and hence, their individual frequencies. If the target Hamiltonian requires multiple qubits and gates between them, it is important that we arrange the geometric configurations such that their resonance frequencies are well-separated and their mutual capacitance or inductance is kept small to avoid unwanted couplings.\nFinally, we consider the roles that each element in the device must play, which is crucial for setting up their input/output coupling. For resonators, there are generally three main functions: readout, memory, or bus. A readout resonator should be relatively strongly coupled to a transmission line to allow efficient extraction of information, with an output coupling Q typically on the order of $10^3$ to $10^4$. In planar designs, the coupling Q between a CPW resonator and a CPW feedline can be controlled by a conveniently parameterized coupling capacitance at the end of the resonator. In 3D designs, the coupling Q of the resonator is often controlled by the length of the coupling pin\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (extension of the coaxial center conductor) inserted into the cavity wall (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:device_3d)(d)). On the other hand, a long-lived quantum memory resonator should be designed with an input drive line with coupling Q sufficiently high to not compromise its total quality factor.\n\nSimilarly, we also need to evaluate what functionalities each qubit should be endowed with.\nA fixed-frequency transmon simply requires a single junction connected to two superconducting pads, whicle a flux-tunable qubit requires more JJs to form flux loops. This can be implemented in configurations such as the symmetric/asymmetric SQUID transmons, SNAIL\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], flux qubits\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and fluxonium\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In addition, the use of flux-tunable elements also entails that we must include flux-bias lines. This can use a short-ended CPW in close vicinity to the flux loop in planar circuits. In 3D architecture, a centimeter-scale external coil can be used to provide a global DC flux to flux-tunable devices inside a copper package\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], but fast and local flux-biasing remains under development\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nControlling these quantum elements requires carefully designed microwave feed-lines. For fixed-frequency transmons, this translates into the addition of capacitively coupled drive line for X/Y control of the qubit. On the other hand, flux-tunable elements require inductively coupled flux-bias lines. Adding these features necessarily introduces a coupling to the (dissipative) environment and could result in elevated dissipation rates in the device.\n\nThe reduction in the coherence (relaxation) time due these additional elements can be calculated\nwith a circuit model using the dissipative environmental impedance $\\mathrm{Re}[Z(\\omega)]$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]:\n$$\n\n\\Gamma = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Re}[Z(\\omega)] C_\\Sigma },\n\n$$\nwhere $C_\\Sigma$ is the effective capacitance of the transmon.\n\nFor a transmon coupled to a resonator, this reproduces the Purcell limit (\u00a0<ref>). For a transmon qubit capacitively coupled to a microwave drive line, this results in an effective decay rate of\n$$\n\n\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{D}}  \\simeq \\omega_q^2 Z_0 C_c^2 / C_\\Sigma,\n\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_q$ is the resonance frequency of the qubit, $Z_0$ is the characteristic impedance (typically $50~\\Omega$), $C_c$ is the coupling capacitance. Assuming the typical system parameters of $\\omega = 2\\pi\\cdot 5\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, $C_\\Sigma=65\\,\\mathrm{fF}$, and $C_c=0.1\\,\\mathrm{fF}$, we get an effective energy relaxation time of $T_1 = 1/\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{D}}\\approx 132\\,\\mu \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nSimilar analysis for a flux-bias line, modelled as a capacitance $C_c$ in series with the transmon and a shunt inductance $L_c$, gives an effective decay rate\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]:\n$$\n\n\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{FBL}} \\simeq \\frac{1}{Z_0  C_\\Sigma} \\left(\\frac{\\omega_q}{\\omega_c}\\right)^4 ,\n\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_c= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L_c C_c}}$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Filling in typical values of $\\omega_q = 2\\pi\\cdot 5\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, $C_\\Sigma=65\\,\\mathrm{fF}$,  $C_c=10\\,\\mathrm{fF}$, and $C_c=20\\,\\mathrm{pH}$ results in an effective $T_1$ $1/\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{FBL}}\\approx 83\\,\\mu \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nPractically, superconducting quantum devices often more complex than such a simple model could capture. Hence, these equations can only serve as a rule-of-thumb in the design process. Many advanced software tools, such as QuCAT\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and scqubits\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], can help in calculating the device parameters and dissipation rates more accurately."}

The heat flow $P_i$ to stage $i$ with temperature $T_i$ due to a single coaxial cable is given by\n\n$$\n\\label{eqn:heat-flow}\nP_i = \\int_{T_{i-1}}^{T_i}dT\\,\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm o}(T) A_{\\rm o} + \\rho_{\\rm d}(T) A_{\\rm d} + \\rho_{\\rm c}(T) A_{\\rm c}}{L_{i}},\n\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_{\\rm o}$, $\\rho_{\\rm d}$, $\\rho_{\\rm c}$, and $A_{\\rm o}$, $A_{\\rm d}$, $A_{\\rm c}$ are thermal conductivities and cross sections of outer conductor (OC), dielectric, and center conductor (CC) respectively, and $L_i$ is the length of the cable connecting stage $i-1$ and $i$. $P_i$ has units of power.

Stainless steel cables (UT85-SS-SS) and NbTi cables (UT85-NbTi) have the lowest passive load. This is why we choose them for drive and output lines, respectively. The flows of these two cable types are dominated by their outer conductor, which has a cross-sectional area that is by a factor 10 larger than the center conductor. The contribution of the Teflon dielectric is of the same order of magnitude as the one of the inner conductor. This results from the low thermal conductivity of Teflon, see Appendix <ref>, and the cross-sectional area of the dielectric being comparable to the one of the outer conductor.\n\nAn alternative to stainless steel cable is Cupronickel (CuNi) cable.

{"prompt": "Explain the 'Conclusion' section of the paper.", "completion": "In this paper we have discussed the theory of the bandpass Purcell filter used in Refs. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for measurement of superconducting qubits. An additional wide-bandwidth filter resonator (Fig. (Figure: Qubit measurement schematic with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter  of Ref. <cit.>)) coupled to the readout resonator easily passes the microwave field used for the qubit measurement, but strongly impedes the propagation of a photon at the qubit frequency, which is far outside of the filter bandwidth. A simple way to quantitatively describe the operation of the filter is by noticing that the effective decay rate $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ of the readout resonator [Eq. (<ref>)] depends on frequency. Therefore, the measurement is governed by a relatively large value $\\kappa_{\\rm r}$ [Eq. (<ref>)], which permits a fast measurement, while the Purcell relaxation is determined by a much smaller value $\\kappa_{\\rm q}$ seen by the qubit [Eq. (<ref>)]. The ratio of these effective decay rates of the readout resonator gives the suppression factor for the qubit relaxation [Eq. (<ref>)]. The result for the suppression factor is similar to the result obtained in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] using circuit theory (with a few minor differences).\n\nWe have first analyzed the operation of the Purcell filter quasiclassically, and then confirmed the results using the quantum approach. In the quantum analysis we have used two approaches: based on decaying wavefunction and density matrix evolutions. While the Purcell effect is traditionally described using density matrices, it is actually simpler to use the approach based on wavefunctions. The results of our semiclassical and two quantum approaches are very close to each other; however, they are not identical because the approaches use slightly different approximations. A simple and most physically transparent result for the Purcell rate is given by Eq. (<ref>).\n\nThe Purcell rate of the qubit decay is further suppressed when a microwave drive is applied for measurement. The effect is similar to what was discussed in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for the standard setup without the filter, and can be crudely understood as being due to the ac Stark shift of the qubit frequency, which increases the resonator-qubit detuning $\\Delta_{\\rm rq}$. Since the Purcell rate with the filter scales with $\\Delta_{\\rm rq}$ crudely as $\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^{-4}$   [Eq. (<ref>)] instead of $\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^{-2}$ in the standard setup, the Purcell rate suppression due to microwaves is stronger in the case with the filter. Numerical results for the suppression due to microwaves using the two-level approximation for the qubit show that the explanation based on ac Stark shift works well, but underestimates the effect by about 10\n\nThe bandpass Purcell filter decreases the qubit decay due to the Purcell effect by a factor of $\\sim$50 for typical parameters, for the same measurement conditions as in the standard setup without the filter.

Here, we engineer an extensible cryogenic setup, which minimizes passive and active heat loads, while guaranteeing rapid qubit control and readout. We review design criteria for qubit drive lines, flux lines, and output lines used in typical experiments with superconducting circuits and describe each type of line in detail. The passive heat load of stainless steel and NbTi coaxial cables and the active load due to signal dissipation are measured, validating our robust and extensible concept for thermal anchoring of attenuators, cables, and other microwave components.\n\nOur results are important for managing the heat budget of future large-scale quantum computers based on superconducting circuits.\n\n## Introduction\nPromising solid-state based quantum computing platforms, such as superconducting circuits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] or charges and spins in semiconductor quantum dots [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], require temperatures on the Millikelvin level to initialise the systems in their ground state and to avoid errors due to thermal excitation during operation. Millikelvin temperatures are achieved in ${\\rm He^3/He^4}$ dilution refrigerators (DR). When scaling those approaches from the few qubit level to large scale quantum processors, an increasing number of microwave and DC cables need to be integrated into the dilution refrigerator. They connect the classical control electronics at room temperature (RT) to the quantum processor at the lowest temperature stage of the dilution refrigerator, creating a substantial heat load on the dilution refrigerator due to heat conduction. Besides this passive load, active load due to the dissipation of control signals in cables and attenuators plays a major role. Dissipation is necessary to thermalize the incoming radiation fields and to reduce the number of thermal photons incident on the sample [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nWhile superconducting quantum processors operating 20 qubits have been recently realized [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], their cryogenic setup and extensibility towards larger system sizes has not been reported on. Here, we present a thermally optimized, robust cabling scheme and cryogenic setup suitable for the operation of 50 qubits at a temperature of 14 mK. Disregarding space constraints in the dilution refrigerator, at least 150 qubits could be operated. Before describing our customized cryogenic system in Section <ref>, we put forward methods of how to minimize passive heat loads on the stages of the dilution refrigerator and how to minimize thermal photons in cables connecting the room temperature to the base temperature stage while keeping active load low (Section <ref>).\n\nWe then present measurements of the passive loads arising from subsequent installations of cable trees comprising typically 25 coaxial lines each, and compare them to estimates based on available data on thermal conductances of coaxial cables (Section <ref>). Active loads due to application of control signals are characterized in Section <ref>. Finally, we discuss the total heat load in Section <ref> along with possible improvements which would allow to increase the number of operational qubits to up to thousand when disregarding space constraints.\n\n### Typical cabling for experiments with superconducting circuits\nWhen designing the control lines and output lines connecting to a superconducting quantum processor (QP) the goal is to provide sufficiently strong coupling rates to the quantum processor, while minimizing decoherence due to coupling of the QP via these lines to its environment.\n\nThermal noise, present due to the connection of the QP to electronics at room temperature, not only leads to qubit dephasing [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], but can also lead to creation of quasi-particles and thus to dissipation and reduced energy relaxation times [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Hence, thorough thermalization of cables, attenuators, and microwave components at the various temperature stages of the dilution refrigerator is not only important for reducing the heat load on the dilution refrigerator, but also for protecting the QP from thermal radiation. In addition to thermal anchoring, filters with stop-bands outside the frequency range of qubits and readout resonators as well as infra-red blocking filters [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] further suppress thermal radiation. Other sources of external noise that can negatively impact coherence times include 1/f noise [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] from electronic instruments and magnetic field fluctuations or magnetic offset fields inducing magnetic vortices that can lead to dissipation [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. These sources can be mitigated with appropriate filters and magnetic shielding respectively, but their study is not a focus of this work.\n\nWe briefly present an overview of the cabling typically used in experiments with superconducting circuits. We distinguish between direct-current (DC) and radio-frequency (RF) cabling. DC lines are made from twisted pair wires, that are typically low-pass filtered and thermalized at each temperature stage. Typical scopes of applications are biasing of cryogenic amplifiers and flux biasing of tunable frequency qubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. RF lines on the other hand are realized as semi-rigid microwave cables and contain various microwave components such as attenuators, filters or amplifiers. They connect to the QP and are used for control and readout of the quantum processor. One typically distinguishes between drive lines, flux lines, and output lines, which we briefly described here.\n\nDrive lines are used for driving qubits with a microwave tone realizing single-qubit gates, and for driving readout resonators. To reduce thermal population of qubits, and frequency shifts of the qubits due to their dispersive interaction with a readout resonator [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the number of thermal noise photons in the drive lines arriving at the mixing chamber plate (MXC) of the dilution refrigerator should be well below the single photon level in both cases. More precisely, to guarantee a noise photon number at MXC on the $10^{-3}$ level, a total attenuation of about 60 dB is required, see Section <ref> and <ref>. The bandwidth of the drive lines is required to be large enough to cover the typical frequency ranges of qubits (4-6 GHz) and of readout resonators (4-8 GHz).\n\nFlux lines are mainly used for implementing two-qubit gates which are based on the dynamical tunability of the transition frequency of a qubit [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] or of a separate coupling subcircuit [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In addition, qubit frequency variations, occurring due to imperfections in the fabrication of Josephson junctions, can be compensated. Tunable frequency qubits, as opposed to fixed frequency qubits, make use of a SQUID loop instead of a single Josephson junction as the inductive element. By threading a magnetic flux $\\Phi$ through this loop the frequency of the qubit approximately changes as $\\omega_q\\simeq\\omega_0 \\sqrt{|{\\rm cos}(\\pi\\Phi/\\Phi_0)|}$ [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where $\\Phi_0$ is the magnetic flux quantum.\n\nA mutual inductance between flux line and SQUID loop is realized by routing the on-chip part of the flux line past the SQUID loop. Hence, a current applied to the flux line results in a magnetic flux in the SQUID loop, effectively tuning the transition frequency of the qubit. Low-pass filters in the flux lines limit the bandwidth to about 1 GHz eliminating thermal noise at qubit frequencies. However, since the magnetic flux $\\Phi$ in the SQUID loop sets the qubit transition frequency, current noise leads to qubit dephasing [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. To reduce it, a suitable amount of attenuation (10-20 dB) is also added in the flux lines, see Section <ref>.\n\nOutput lines contain a series of cryogenic and room temperature amplifiers for the sensitive detection of readout signals [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. To isolate the sample from thermal noise photons and from noise of amplifiers while not attenuating the output signal, isolators and circulators are used, see Section <ref> for more details.\n\n## Sources of heat loads\nWe consider three dominant contributions to the heat load on the dilution refrigerator. First, passive load is due to heat flow from higher temperature stages to lower temperature stages. Here, we consider only heat conducted through installed cables. Heat which flows via posts that separate the various plates of the dilution refrigerator is not considered because it is already taken into account in the specified cooling power of the dilution refrigerator [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Second, active load arises due to the dissipation (Joule heating) of applied microwave signals in attenuators and in the microwave cables themselves. Dissipation arising from DC signals, used e.g. to bias HEMT amplifiers at the 4K stage or to flux bias qubits on the chip at MXC, falls also in this category. Third, radiative load from stages and shields of higher temperature to stages and shields of lower temperature [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This load, however, is also taken into account in the specified cooling power of the dilution refrigerator. For completeness, we mention load due to residual gas, in particular Helium since it has the highest vapor pressure at cryogenic temperatures. However, during normal operation of the dilution refrigerator, the cryo-pumping capacity of the cold surfaces in the dilution refrigerator keeps the pressure in the vacuum can below $10^{-5}$ mbar providing an adequate isolation vacuum [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. We therefore do not consider this load.\n\n### Passive load\nTo minimize passive heat load we use cable materials with low thermal conductivity. Note that with the exception of superconductors this typically goes along with poor electrical conductivity, and hence leads to more dissipation when microwave signals are applied. However, in most of the lines attenuation and thus dissipation is anyway desired in order to thermalize the incoming radiation fields, see Section <ref>.\n\nTo estimate the passive load due to installed cables we consider fixed temperatures on the plates of the dilution refrigerator, corresponding to a steady state, in which the heat flows onto the various stages are absorbed by the cooling powers available at those stages. Note that the cooling power on a given stage depends on the temperature of that stage. The heat flow $P_i$ to stage $i$ with temperature $T_i$ due to a single coaxial cable is given by\n\n$$\n\\label{eqn:heat-flow}\nP_i = \\int_{T_{i-1}}^{T_i}dT\\,\\frac{\\rho_{\\rm o}(T) A_{\\rm o} + \\rho_{\\rm d}(T) A_{\\rm d} + \\rho_{\\rm c}(T) A_{\\rm c}}{L_{i}},\n\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_{\\rm o}$, $\\rho_{\\rm d}$, $\\rho_{\\rm c}$, and $A_{\\rm o}$, $A_{\\rm d}$, $A_{\\rm c}$ are thermal conductivities and cross sections of outer conductor (OC), dielectric, and center conductor (CC) respectively, and $L_i$ is the length of the cable connecting stage $i-1$ and $i$. $P_i$ has units of power. The labeling $i\\in\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ corresponds to the stages {\"50K\", \"4K\", \"Still\", Cold plate (\"CP\"), \"MXC\"}. Table (Table tab:DR) lists the corresponding temperatures in our Bluefors XLD400 dilution refrigerator as achieved in the empty dilution refrigerator after installation.

Coaxial cable lengths towards the respective stages are listed as well.\n\nTo motivate the choice of cable materials detailed in Section <ref> we plot in Fig. (Figure fig:heatFlow-materials) the heat flow to the various temperature stages due to single coaxial cables of different material.\n\nNote that these estimates assume thermalization of outer conductor, dielectric, and center conductor at every temperature stage, see Section <ref> for a discussion.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nHeat flow for indicated cable types. Heat flow to the five temperature stages for indicated cable types and given cable lengths (see text).\n\nTwisted pairs (TwP) consist of either Cu or PhBr from RT to the 4K stage, and of NbTi from the 4K to the MXC stage.\n\nThree typical and readily available types of coaxial cable are shown. The lengths of the cables are listed in Table (Table tab:DR) and correspond to the inter-plate distances in the dilution refrigerator plus a small correction due to the bends in those cables (see Section <ref>). Stainless steel cables (UT85-SS-SS) and NbTi cables (UT85-NbTi) have the lowest passive load. This is why we choose them for drive and output lines, respectively. The flows of these two cable types are dominated by their outer conductor, which has a cross-sectional area that is by a factor 10 larger than the center conductor. The contribution of the Teflon dielectric is of the same order of magnitude as the one of the inner conductor. This results from the low thermal conductivity of Teflon, see Appendix <ref>, and the cross-sectional area of the dielectric being comparable to the one of the outer conductor.\n\nAn alternative to stainless steel cable is Cupronickel (CuNi) cable. It is expected to have a 20-30\n\nIn our dilution refrigerator DC wiring is pre-installed. Copper or Phosphor-Bronze (PhBr) twisted pairs of diameters AWG35 and AWG36 respectively are only used from room temperature to the 4K stage due to their large thermal conductivity. From 4K to MXC superconducting NbTi twisted pairs are used[For clarity, NbTi twisted pairs are considered to consist of pure NbTi, although they are typically embedded in a CuNi matrix for mechanical stability.]. Fig. (Figure fig:heatFlow-materials) shows that among these materials only Cu twisted pairs cause a significant passive load comparable to the one of the coaxial cables.\n\n### Active load\nThe active load in the dilution refrigerator depends on the attenuation installed in the RF lines and on the signal levels required at the chip. We therefore in this section briefly discuss how much attenuation is needed to suppress thermal noise and how to distribute the attenuators among the various temperature stages. Furthermore, we discuss the signal levels required in typical experiments with superconducting qubits.\n\n#### The need of attenuation\nAlthough the signals required to drive qubits or to read them out are small (e.g. a peak power of -66 dBm for a 30 ns long $\\pi$-pulse), the power applied at the input of the dilution refrigerator needs to be orders of magnitude larger. This is because a total attenuation of at least $\\sim 60\\,$dB is required to reduce room temperature blackbody radiation, present in cables thermalized at room temperature, to a level corresponding to a thermal photon occupation number of a few $10^{-3}$ at the sample. This one-dimensional blackbody radiation in cables is known as Johnson-Nyquist noise in electronics. If a resistor $R$ is connected to the cable or if the cable is coaxial with a characteristic impedance $R$ the induced voltage fluctuations have a two-sided power spectral density given by\n$$\n\\label{eqn:JNnoisequantum}\nS_{V}^{\\rm th}(T) = 2 {\\rm k_B} T R \\frac{h|\\nu|}{{\\rm k_B} T} \\frac{1}{\\textup{exp}(h|\\nu|/{\\rm k_B} T)-1}.\n\n$$\n\nThe last factor in this equation is the photon occupation number as dictated by the Bose-Einstein distribution $n_{\\textup{BE}}=1/\\left[ \\textup{exp}(h|\\nu|/{\\rm k_B} T)-1 \\right]$. It is dimensionless and can be thought of as number of photons per Hz frequency interval, per second. In the classical limit $h\\nu\\ll{\\rm k_B} T$ one recovers the original (two-sided) Johnson Nyquist formula $S_{V}^{\\rm th}(T) = 2 {\\rm k_B} T R$.\n\nIn a coaxial cable connecting room temperature to base temperature, thermal photons\n\npropagate down the line towards the lower temperature stages. To reduce the spectral density of this radiation a series of attenuators is installed in the microwave line.\n\nAn attenuator with an attenuation of $A=20\\,\\textup{dB}=100$  can be considered to effectively function as a beamsplitter which transmits 1\n$$\n\\label{eqn:attenuator}\nn_i(\\nu)=\\frac{n_{i-1}(\\nu)}{A_i} + \\frac{A_i-1}{A_i}n_{\\textup{BE}}(T_{i,{\\rm att}},\\nu).\n\n$$\nWhen installing a cascade of attenuators in the microwave line thermalized at subsequently lower temperature stages, we employ this relation to determine the noise photon occupation number at the MXC stage, $n_{\\rm MXC}$.\n\nFor our considerations we fix the signal frequency to $\\nu_0=6$ GHz since typical qubits are operated at 5 GHz and typical readout resonators at 7 GHz. A lower bound for the total attenuation needed to achieve a noise photon number of $n_{\\rm MXC}=10^{-3}$ is obtained by neglecting the second term on the r.h.s. of Eqn. <ref> yielding $n_{\\textup{BE}}(T=300\\,{\\rm K},\\nu_0)/10^{-3}=60$ dB. This is a lower bound since blackbody radiation emitted by attenuators at all other temperature stages is neglected.\n\nDistributing the total attenuation among the various temperature stages is important to keep the active load on the lower stages well below the cooling powers available at those stages. In distributing the attenuation we avoid putting more attenuation $A_i$ on stage $i$ than is needed to thermalize the incoming radiation fields onto that stage, i.e. the first term on the r.h.s. of Eqn. <ref> should not be significantly smaller than the value to which the second term saturates for $A_i\\gg1$. Hence, good reference values for the attenuation on stage $i$ are $A_{i,{\\rm ref}}=n_{\\textup{BE}}(T_{i-1},\\nu_0)/n_{\\textup{BE}}(T_{i},\\nu_0)$. As an example we consider a total attenuation of 60 dB that is composed of 20 dB attenuators on the 4K, CP, and MXC stages. We first plot $n_{\\rm MXC}$ as a function of $A_{\\rm 4K}$ for a fixed attenuation of 20 dB at the CP and MXC stages respectively, see blue solid line in Fig. (Figure fig:thermal-photons). We observe that the number of noise photons is efficiently reduced by increasing the attenuation up to $\\sim20\\,$dB, as expected from the reference value $A_{\\rm 4K, guess}=n_{\\textup{BE}}(T_{\\rm RT},\\nu_0)/n_{\\textup{BE}}(T_{\\rm 4K},\\nu_0)\\approx T_{\\rm RT}/T_{\\rm 4K}=300/3=20$ dB. More attenuation is unnecessary because at this value the radiation field incident from room temperature has reached the 4K thermal noise floor.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nThermal noise photon numbers. a) Calculated thermal photon number at MXC as a function of the degree of attenuation at the 4K stage (blue), CP (green), MXC (red) for a fixed attenuation of 20dB at the respective other stages (45K stage and 1K stage have no attenuators in this example). The calculations are based on Eqn. <ref>. b) Thermal noise current spectral density at MXC as a function of attenuation at the 4K stage, calculated using Eqn. <ref>.\n\nA similar property is found when plotting $n_{\\rm MXC}$ as a function of $A_{\\rm CP}$, for a fixed attenuation of 20 dB at the 4K and MXC stages respectively (green dashed line in Fig. (Figure fig:thermal-photons)). Here a little bit more than 20 dB attenuation would further reduce $n_{\\rm MXC}$, as expected from a reference value $A_{\\rm CP, ref}=n_{\\textup{BE}}(T_{\\rm 4K},\\nu_0)/n_{\\textup{BE}}(T_{\\rm CP},\\nu_0)=22$ dB.\n\nWe finally plot $n_{\\rm MXC}$ as a function of attenuation at MXC (red dash-dotted line in Fig. (Figure fig:thermal-photons)). It demonstrates that over the considered attenuation range adding more attenuation at MXC linearly decreases $n_{\\rm MXC}$. This is because the noise floor of thermal photons at MXC is as low as $n_{\\textup{BE}}(T_{\\rm MXC}=20\\,{\\rm mK},\\nu_0)=6\\times 10^{-7}$. However, we will see in section <ref> that the limited cooling power at MXC prevents us from installing significantly more than 20 dB of attenuation at MXC.\n\n#### Signal levels required for the operation of the QP\nIn this section we estimate the powers required at the chip for two important operations on superconducting qubits: driving a $\\pi$-pulse on a qubit and setting a flux bias on a qubit.\n\nTo drive a $\\pi$-pulse on a qubit, we apply an RF pulse at the qubit frequency with a Gaussian envelope through a CPW transmission line weakly capacitively coupled to the qubit. This coupling has to be sufficiently small to prevent Purcell decay of the qubit into the transmission line [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The finite value of the coupling imposes a limit on the $T_1$ time of the qubit, which we target here to be no lower than $T_1^{\\rm lim}=0.5\\,$ms, significantly larger than state-of-the-art coherence times [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The amplitude of the time-dependent Rabi frequency $\\Omega_R(t) = \\Omega_0 {\\rm exp}\\left[-t^2/(2\\sigma^2)\\right]$ for a 30 ns long $\\pi$-pulse with a width of $\\sigma=5\\,$ns is given by $\\Omega_0=\\sqrt{\\pi/(2\\sigma^2)}\\approx2\\pi\\times 40$ MHz. To achieve this value a peak power $P_{\\rm p}=\\hbar\\omega_q T_1^{\\rm lim}\\Omega_0^2/4\\approx -66\\,$dBm is needed [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For an estimate of the associated heat load we employ the average power of the pulse, $P_{\\rm avg}=P_{\\rm p}\\frac{1}{6\\sigma}\\int_{-3\\sigma}^{3\\sigma}{\\rm exp}\\left[-t^2/(2\\sigma^2)\\right]\\,{\\rm d}t=\\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{6}P_{\\rm p}\\approx -71\\,$dBm. This number will be further reduced due to a finite duty cycle of those pulses during the execution of a quantum algorithm. We assume a maximum duty cycle of 33\n\nReadout signals used to drive readout resonators to infer the state of qubits are typically an order of magnitude smaller and have a lower duty cycle. They are therefore not taken into account in our estimates.\n\nConcerning dissipation in flux lines, we primarily consider DC biasing currents, which are constantly applied to set the qubit frequency, in most of the cases to the so-called sweet spot frequency $\\omega_q=\\omega_0$, at which $\\omega_q$ is to first-order insensitive to flux noise [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Assuming a worst case scenario of random offset magnetic fields in the SQUID loops, the compensating flux $\\Phi_{\\rm offset}$ which we apply to reach the closest sweet spot, is equally distributed in the interval $[-\\Phi_0/2,\\Phi_0/2]$. This corresponds to a current interval of [-1,1] mA, when using a reasonable mutual inductance between flux line and SQUID loop of $M=\\partial\\Phi/\\partial I=0.5$ $\\Phi_0/{\\rm mA}$. The mutual inductance is determined by the coupling strength (proximity) of the on-chip flux line to the SQUID loop and the area of the SQUID loop. A large $M$ on the one hand minimizes the required current and thus dissipation in the line, and allows for the usage of low-noise current sources which typically have a small dynamic range. On the other hand, a large SQUID loop is also more susceptible to (external) magnetic flux noise, and care needs to be taken in the design of large coupling strengths in order to keep residual capacitive coupling of the qubit to the flux line low, which otherwise can limit the qubit lifetime due to the Purcell effect [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The dissipated heat due to the bias currents is most critical at the MXC stage because least cooling power is available there. The amount of dissipation\n\ndepends on the DC resistances of the stainless steel cable and low-pass filter installed between CP and MXC, and to which stage this dissipated heat predominantly flows to. We experimentally determine this heat load as discussed in Section <ref>.\n\nWe also consider dissipation due to flux pulses, which are used for the realization of two-qubit gates. Assuming that during the flux pulse the qubit's frequency is tuned by about 10\n\n### Radiative load\nEach temperature stage except for CP is fitted with a dedicated heat shield. For a given temperature stage $i$ we calculate the radiative heat load on heat shield $i$ from the enclosing heat shield by assuming infinitely extended cylindrical heat shields, and solving a system of coupled heat equations. The heat shields are made of Aluminium on the 50K and 4K stage and of Cu on Still and MXC. They are characterized by their emissivity $\\epsilon=0.06$, as quoted by the manufacturer.\n\nCompared to the cooling power of each stage, we find a significant contribution only for the 50K stage, amounting to $\\sim 50\\,$W. This corresponds to about half of the nominal cooling power of the two pulse tube coolers (2x Cryomech PT 420). This load however has already been taken into account in the available cooling power as specified by the manufacturer (40-50 W). Radiative loads at the lower temperature stages are insignificant [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n## Cryogenic setup\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nCabled dilution refrigerator (DR). a) Bluefors XLD DR with 25 drive lines, 25 flux lines, 4 read-out, 6 read-in, and 5 pump lines installed (see end of Section <ref> for details). b) Schematic of the cabling configuration inside the DR.\n\n### Dilution refrigerator (DR)\nA customized version of a Bluefors XLD400 dilution refrigerator as described in this paper is shown in Fig. (Figure fig:DR) a. It has a dilution unit positioned in the center of the MXC plate, making space available for an additional line-of-sight (LOS) port at the circumference of the system. A total of six LOS side ports are available in the system for the installation of RF cables. A LOS port consists of a series of vertically aligned cutouts in the plates of the dilution refrigerator designed for the installation of Cu plates for the thermalization of cables and attenuators, see Fig. (Figure fig:thermalizationscheme) a-c. Instead of the circular cutouts we designed rectangular cutouts with a width of 88 mm. They allow for mounting fully assembled cable trees from the side using a custom mounting tool, see Fig. (Figure fig:thermalizationscheme) e-g. This has the advantage that the cable trees, comprising 25 RF lines and the vacuum flange, can be pre-assembled and tested outside of the dilution refrigerator. Two out of the eight sectors at the circumference at the 50K and 4K stages are occupied by two pulse tube coolers , but we make use of the corresponding cutouts on the Still, CP, MXC stages for installing readout components, as discussed below.\n\nFurthermore, the distance between the Still plate and the CP has been enlarged by 60 mm to provide more space for the inline integration of MW components, and for reducing the passive heat load due to the cables from Still to CP. The dilution refrigerator was pre-equipped by the manufacturer according to our specifications with two looms of Cu twisted pairs (AWG 35) and two looms of Ph-Br twisted pairs (AWG 36), running both from room temperature to 4K. From 4K to MXC two looms of NbTi twisted pairs were pre-installed. Each of the looms contains 12 twisted pairs.\n\nWe have measured the cooling powers available on all stages of our custom dilution refrigerator (in the presence of the pre-installed DC wiring), see Table (Table tab:DR), using the technique described in Section <ref>. These powers are not to be exceeded to guarantee a base temperature below 20 mK [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. We designed and planned the wiring and attenuation scheme of the dilution refrigerator with the goal to not exceed those cooling powers.\n\nThe table also contains the RF cable lengths between the stages. Note that the cables have bends (bending radius $\\sim 1\\,$cm) to reduce strain on RF connectors when the system is cooled down.\n\nAs discussed in Section <ref>, good thermalization of the cables and attenuators is important for both reducing thermal noise photons affecting qubit coherence and reducing the heat load on the lower temperature stages affecting the cryostat performance. For this purpose, we have developed a flexible thermalization method for both attenuators and cables. It consists of a Cu plate with hexagonal cutouts, in which we individually clamp attenuators using a wedge shaped Cu piece, which presses the attenuator against two faces of the cutout when tightening a three millimeter (M3) Brass screw (Fig. (Figure fig:thermalizationscheme) a and b). The torque applied on each screw for fastening amounts to 0.9 Nm. We use Brass screws as they thermally contract more than Cu when cooled down, providing additional clamping force to the attenuator. This is important, because in general the contact resistance between two metal pieces at low temperatures is dominated by clamping force rather than surface area [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. We thermalize RF cables using the same Cu plate (Fig. (Figure fig:thermalizationscheme) c) in combination with a two-part Cu adapter (Fig. (Figure fig:thermalizationscheme) d). The round flange on those pieces guarantees radiation tight mounting. Using those plates we fit 25 RF lines into each of the six LOS ports.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nThermalization concept and pre-assembly of cable trees. a) CAD drawing of the Cu plate used to mount attenuators. To clamp the attenuators to the copper plate, an adapter as shown in d) is used. The Cu plates are then screwed onto the corresponding plate of the DR. b) Photograph of such a mounting plate with cabling installed in the DR. c) Photograph of the same plate, here used to clamp RF cables using the radiation tight Cu adapter pieces shown in d). d) Two-part Cu adapter that is pressed around an RF cable using the wedge shaped piece in the middle in combination with a screw (see also a)). e) Preassembly tool with mounted Cu plates and vacuum flange. f) Vacuum flange with vacuum tight SMA adapters installed. g) Mounting the preassembled cable tree into the DR using a custom mounting tool.\n\nWe now continue to describe in more detail the custom cabling of the dilution refrigerator. Schematics of drive lines, flux lines, and lines for readout are shown in Fig. (Figure fig:DR)\u00a0b and are typical for superconducting qubit experiments. To minimize passive heat load, we choose UT85-SS-SS cables for all types of lines except for the output lines[Smaller diameter cables of the same type would further reduce the passive heat load, but introduce a larger frequency dependence in the S21 transmission parameter.]. We characterize and test the system at half of its capacity by installing three out of six possible cable trees in the dilution refrigerator: a cable tree comprising of 25 drive lines, a cable tree comprising of 25 flux lines, and a cable tree comprising of lines needed for readout. This readout cable tree consists of six drive lines and 5 pump lines (see Section <ref>), running both from top to bottom of the dilution refrigerator, and four output lines running from room temperature to 4K. The remaining parts of the output lines continue in the non-LOS cutouts below one of the pulse tube coolers, where more space is available, see Fig. (Figure fig:outputlinecomponents).\n\n### Drive line configuration\nBased on our discussion of thermal noise photons in Section <ref> here we motivate our choice of attenuator configuration of 20 dB attenuators at each of the 4K, CP, MXC stages. We first plot the thermal noise photon number at MXC $n_{\\rm MXC}$ in a coaxial cable connecting the room temperature vacuum flange to MXC, for four attenuator configurations each with 60 dB of total attenuation, see Fig. (Figure fig:signal-dissipation) a. The calculations assume as effective attenuator temperatures the plate temperatures listed in the second column of Table (Table tab:DR). For configuration C1={0, 10, 0, 20, 30} dB we obtain $n_{\\rm MXC}\\approx0.0012$, which is only by 12\n\nRemoving 10 dB of attenuation at the CP and adding 10 dB at the 4K stage results in C2={0, 20, 0, 10, 30} dB and reduces the active load on the CP by a factor 10. The resulting value of $n_{\\rm MXC}=0.002$ is almost a factor of two larger than in C1 because 20 dB of attenuation at the 4K stage already corresponds to the regime where $n_{\\rm MXC}$ as a function of $A_{\\rm 4K}$ starts to saturate to the 4K noise floor, see Fig. (Figure fig:thermal-photons) a. We also note that dissipation on the 4K stage is relatively low compared to the available cooling power and thus redistributing some of the attenuation at 4K to the 50K stage is not necessary. Configuration C3={0, 20, 0, 20, 20} dB corresponds to C2 with 10 dB of attenuation moved from the MXC to the CP stage. In this case the noise photon number only increases by 20\n\nTo further reduce the active load on the CP by a factor ten one can redistribute 10 dB from the CP to the Still, resulting in configuration C4={0, 20, 10, 10, 20} dB. However, $n_{\\rm MXC}$ thereby increases by a factor of two compared to C3, which can be explained with similar arguments as above. A relatively small increase in $n_{\\rm MXC}$ as compared to C3 can be achieved by redistributing only 3 dB from the CP to the Still, reducing the load on the CP by a factor two. However, this is not very practical since it comes along with a non-standard attenuation of 17 dB at the CP. In addition, solutions with four attenuators require an additional hardware cost of one attenuator and one connectorized RF cable per line as compared to solutions with only three attenuators per line.\n\nAs a compromise between the number of noise photons and a low heat load on MXC we select C3, with a noise photon number of about 0.1\n\nTo filter infrared radiation that can lead to quasi-particle generation and thus to a reduced $T_1$ time [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], we provide the option to install a custom-built IR filter based on Eccosorb CR-124 absorber material right before the attenuator at MXC, see Appendix <ref>. With an attenuation of 6 dB at 6 GHz, it further reduces $n_{\\rm MXC}$ by a factor four, while increasing dissipation on all stages except MXC by a factor four.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nThermal noise photons and signal dissipation. a) Thermal noise photon number $n_{\\rm MXC}$ at 6 GHz for four attenuator configurations C1-C4 in the drive lines (see text). Taking into account attenuation in the cables reduces $n_{\\rm MXC}$ to the values indicated by the dashed bars. b) Dissipated power on the indicated stages of the DR due to the operation of 25 drive lines with signal levels translating into an average power level of -78 dBm at the input of the QP. Calculations for the four attenuator configurations C1-C4 are shown.\n\n### Flux line configuration\nTo reduce current and thus magnetic flux noise in the SQUID loop of a qubit, a suitable amount of attenuation needs to be installed in the flux lines. Part of this attenuation can be realized at room temperature to reduce 1/f noise and white noise from the instruments connected to the flux line (e.g. an arbitrary waveform generator) to the level of room temperature Johnson-Nyquist noise.\n\nTo reduce the noise level below room temperature Johnson-Nyquist noise we install a single attenuator $A_{\\rm 4K}$at the 4K stage.\n\nThe current-noise power spectral density after this attenuator is calculated as\n$$\n\\label{eqn:currentnoise}\nS_{I}^{\\rm th, eff} = \\frac{S_{I}^{\\rm th}(T_{\\rm RT})}{A_{\\rm 4K}} + \\frac{A_{\\rm 4K}-1}{A_{\\rm 4K}}S_{I}^{\\rm th}(T_{\\rm 4K}),\n\n$$\nwhere $S_{I}^{\\rm th}(T) = 2 {\\rm k_B} T/R$ is the two-sided current-noise power spectral density of Johnson-Nyquist noise. The resistance $R=50\\,\\Omega$ corresponds to the internal impedance of a typical arbitrary waveform generator instrument.\n\nNote that as opposed to using Eq. <ref> in the context of thermal noise in the drive lines, considering the classical Johnson-Nyquist formula here is sufficient since the thermal energy at $T_{\\rm 4K}\\approx 3$ K is much larger than the relevant noise frequencies of $\\lesssim 1$ GHz. We plot $S_{I}^{\\rm th, eff}$ as a function of $A_{\\rm 4K}$ for $T_{\\rm RT}\\approx 300$ K and $T_{\\rm 4K}\\approx 3$ K in Fig. (Figure fig:thermal-photons) b. Similar to Fig. (Figure fig:thermal-photons) a $S_{I}^{\\rm th, eff}$  saturates at the thermal noise floor of the 4K stage for attenuator values $A_{\\rm 4K}\\gtrsim 20$ dB.\n\nWe use $S_{I}^{\\rm th, eff}$ for deriving upper bounds on the coherence times $T_2^*$ and the echo coherence time $T_2$ due to thermal noise in the flux lines [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n$$\n\\label{eq:T2limitwhite}\nT_2^* = \\frac{1}{2} T_2^E = \\frac{2}{D^2 S_I}.\n\n$$\nHere, $S_I(\\omega)=\\int {\\rm d}t\\langle\\delta I(0) \\delta I(t)\\rangle {\\rm e}^{-i\\omega t}$ is the power spectral density of the current noise and $D$ the sensitivity of the qubit transition frequency $\\omega_{\\rm ge}$ to the current $I$ in the flux line\n$$\n\\label{eqn:partials}\nD = \\frac{\\partial\\omega_{\\rm ge}}{\\partial I} = \\frac{\\partial\\omega_{\\rm ge}}{\\partial \\Phi} \\frac{\\partial\\Phi}{\\partial I}.\n\n$$\nUsing a typical mutual inductance between flux line and SQUID loop of $M=\\frac\\partial\\Phi\\partial I=0.5$ $\\Phi_0/{\\rm mA}$ we obtain $T_2^*=(46, 426, 2333)\\,\\mu$s for an attenuation of (0, 10, 20) dB, at a 10\n\n### Output line configuration\nOur four output lines are designed for the detection of signals on the single photon level [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. We use travelling wave Josephson parametric amplifiers (TWPA) [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] with a broadband gain of 20-30 dB over a frequency range of 3-12 GHz as a near-quantum limited amplifier installed at MXC, see Fig. (Figure fig:outputlinecomponents) a. High-electron mobility transistor (HEMT) amplifiers (LNF LNC4_8C) with a gain of about 40 dB are installed at the 4K stage, see Fig. (Figure fig:outputlinecomponents) b. More than a total of 60 dB isolation towards the sample is provided by a circulator (Quinstar QCY-060400CM00) at CP and two isolators at MXC. The two isolators with an operation range of 3-12 GHz are also required for impedance matching of the TWPA over its entire gain bandwidth. For this purpose, one of the isolators is installed before and one after the TWPA, see Fig. (Figure fig:DR) b. Each isolator is part of a four-channel isolator array (Quinstar QCC-075900XM000), see Fig. (Figure fig:outputlinecomponents) a. Circulators and isolators are both magnetically shielded.\n\nA reflective cavity bandpass filter (Keenlion KBF-4/8-2S) at MXC suppresses noise at frequencies outside the bandwidths of circulator and isolators, see Fig. (Figure fig:outputlinecomponents) c. To minimize signal loss between the two amplfiers, we use superconducting NbTi coaxial cables between MXC and 4K. To minimize passive heat load we chose stainless steel cables from 4K to room temperature. According to Friis formula the increased loss compared to e.g. SPCW cable does not decrease the signal to noise ratio of the amplifier chain. E.g. a loss of 10 dB in the cable section between HEMT and the first amplifier at room temperature can be tolerated if one uses a low noise amplifier with a noise temperature of about $500$ K as a first amplifier at room temperature[When using only a HEMT amplifier as a cryogenic amplifier (and not a TWPA), an ultra-low noise amplifier with a noise temperature of about 100 K is required].\n\nFor the operation of the TWPA a microwave pump signal with a typical frequency in the range 6-8 GHz and a power level at the input of the TWPA of about $-55$ dBm is required. This pump signal is added to the TWPA via the isolated port of a 20 dB directional coupler[Choosing a smaller coupling ratio would decrease the transmission of the readout signal through the directional coupler accordingly.] (Krytar 120420), see Fig. (Figure fig:DR) b. Due to the relatively large pump power we use pump lines with a total of 50 dB attenuation as compared to the 60 dB in the drive lines. This 50 dB of attenuation includes the 20 dB attenuation provided by the directional coupler with its coupled port terminated with a 50 $\\Omega$ load resistance. Photographs of the readout components described in this Section are shown in Fig. (Figure fig:outputlinecomponents). The TWPAs and the isolator arrays are mounted to 2 mm thick Cu sheets whose stability is enforced by Cu bars at their borders, see Fig. (Figure fig:outputlinecomponents) a. For compact mounting and thermalization, the four TWPAs and the four bandpass filters (Fig. (Figure fig:outputlinecomponents) c) are first stacked using Cu spacers between them, which are then mounted to the Cu sheet or to an L-shaped bracket, respectively. Similarly, the four HEMT amplifiers and the four circulators are first mounted onto Cu pieces which are then mounted to a common bracket.\n\nUsing the concept of frequency-multiplexed readout [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], each readout line allows for the simultaneous readout of up to 10 superconducting qubits. A pre-requisite for fast frequency-multiplexed single-shot readout is a near-quantum limited amplfier with a bandwidth of at least 1 GHz such as a TWPA.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nIntegration of four high-bandwidth output lines.  a) Components mounted on the MXC plate: readout signals from the quantum processor travel through a first 4-channel, magnetically shielded isolator array (right), followed by directional couplers, TWPAs and a second, identical isolator array (left). b) Four HEMT amplifiers mounted on the 4K plate. c) Four bandpass filters, mounted and thermalized at the MXC plate, followed by four circulators mounted to the cold plate.\n\n## Direct measurements of the passive heat load\nTo determine the passive heat load induced by each cable tree and to extract a heat load per line, we initially performed reference measurements of the cooling power in the dilution refrigerator system as delivered without microwave cabling. Then we cooled down the system each time we installed a new cable tree and recorded the temperature increases on each of the stages of the dilution refrigerator to infer the corresponding passive heat loads. The cooldown of cable trees comprising up to 25 identical lines of a given type has the advantage of generating temperature increases that are larger than typical run-to-run temperature variations on the stages of the dilution refrigerator. Furthermore, this method naturally averages over variations in material and components, as well as over possible variations occurring in the installation and thermalization of individual cables and attenuators.\n\n### Reference measurements\nOur reference measurements consist of applying a well defined heat load to a given temperature stage and recording the increased steady state temperature increases on all the other stages. In steady state the applied heat load corresponds to the cooling power on that stage at its steady state temperature. The measured relative temperature increases are shown as a function of heat load applied to a given stage in Fig. (Figure fig:passiveLoadGraphs). The absolute temperature increase on the stage, to which the power is applied, is indicated on the right axis of each plot.\n\nThe 50K stage and the 4K stage show approximately linear temperature increases over the range of applied powers (up to 10 W for the 50K stage and 0.9W for the 4K stage).\n\nHeating a given stage also affects stages at lower temperature because they are thermally connected via structural elements of the dilution refrigerator such as posts and other elements such as the dilution unit and pre-installed DC wiring. In addition the $^3{\\rm He}$ reaching the Still in the gas phase for condensation is effectively hotter when 50K and 4K stages are heated leading to a larger load on the Still.\n\nThe cooling power on the Still stage is provided mainly by the evaporation of $^3{\\rm He}$ and reflects the dependence of the partial pressure of $^3{\\rm He}$ on temperature [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The temperature of the Still plate increases by about 60\n\nThe CP has no active cooling element, but since it is mounted on top of the last set of heat exchangers [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] it is effectively cooled by the cold mixture entering and leaving the mixing chamber. We measure the temperature increase over a relatively wide range of heat powers up to 300 $\\mu$W since our attenuator configuration C3 in the drive lines is expected to create a significant active load on the CP.\n\nOver this range the temperature of the CP doubles from about 80 mK to about 160 mK, see Fig. (Figure fig:passiveLoadGraphs) d. The effect on $T_{\\rm MXC}$ is relatively low, e.g. at the largest measured value of $P_{\\rm CP}=300\\,\\mu$W $T_{\\rm MXC}$ rises from 6.1 mK to 8.1 mK, corresponding to an effective load of only 1 $\\mu$W on the MXC stage.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nReference measurements in the DR system as delivered. Temperature increases on the different plates of the DR as a function of applied power to the 50K (a), 4K (b), Still (c), CP (d), MXC (e) stages. The temperatures indicated in the upper left corner of the plots represent the starting temperatures, without heat power applied.\n\n### Determination of passive heat loads\nThe reference measurments presented in Fig. (Figure fig:passiveLoadGraphs) allow us to convert an increase in temperature $\\Delta T_i$ observed on stage $i$ after the cooldown of a given cable tree, into a passive heat load\n$$\n\\label{eqn:passiveloadextr}\n\\Delta P_i = \\frac{\\partial P_i}{\\partial T_i}\\Delta T_i\n\n$$\non that stage. The coefficients $\\frac{\\partial P_i}{\\partial T_i}$ are extracted from a linear fit to the low (relative) temperature regimes of the data in Fig. (Figure fig:passiveLoadGraphs). All measured $\\Delta T_i$ are sufficiently small to justify the use of this linear expansion. Additional loads due to an increased temperature of the next higher stage $i-1$ are subtracted by substituting $\\Delta T_i\\rightarrow \\Delta \\tilde{T}_i=\\Delta T_i-\\frac{\\partial T_i}{\\partial P_{i-1}}\\Delta P_{i-1}$ in the r.h.s. of Eq. <ref>. This corresponds to a shift of the data in Fig. (Figure fig:passiveLoadGraphs) along the horizontal axes in negative direction. We have verified this procedure by measuring $T_i$ vs. $P_i$ curves for $P_{i-1}\\neq 0$. The resulting data sets lie on top of their $P_{i-1}= 0$ counterparts in Fig. (Figure fig:passiveLoadGraphs) when shifting the data along the applied power axis by an amount corresponding to $(\\partial T_i/\\partial P_{i-1}) P_{i-1}$. A significant correction $>20$\n\nAdditional care needs to be taken when determining $\\Delta T_{\\rm CP}$ and $\\Delta T_{\\rm MXC}$. This is because an increased Still temperature changes the flow through the dilution unit thereby not only leading to an additional passive load on CP and MXC, but effectively changing the cooling power vs temperature curves. This is most evident for the MXC stage when considering the relation $P_{\\rm MXC}\\propto \\dot{n}_3T_{\\rm MXC}^2$ from above. Before determining $\\Delta T_{\\rm CP}$ and $\\Delta T_{\\rm MXC}$ we thus reduce the Still heat power such that we reach $T_{\\rm Still}=882(1)\\,$mK, correponding to the flow of 0.69(1) mmol/s set for the reference measurements.\n\n!\n\n1l|     1r50K     1r4K     1rStill     1rCP    1rMXC\n\n2*[origin=c]90[c]1.7 cmDrive line UT085 SS-SS       Measured HL     45(23) mW     1.0(2) mW     4(3) $\\mu$W     0.4(2)$\\mu$W     0.013(6)$\\mu$W\n\nPredicted HL     24-27 mW     0.4-1.7 mW     1.9-2.1 $\\mu$W     0.33-0.43 $\\mu$W     0.004 $\\mu$W\n\n2*[origin=c]90[c]1.7cmFlux line UT085 SS-SS \t    Measured HL     56(27) mW     1.2(2) mW     2(1) $\\mu$W     0.29(3) $\\mu$W     0.025(5) $\\mu$W\n\nPredicted HL     24-27 mW     0.4-1.7 mW     1.9-2.1 $\\mu$W     0.30 $\\mu$W     0.027-0.131 $\\mu$W\n\n2*[origin=c]90[c]1.7cmOutput line UT085 NbTi\nMeasured HL     -     -     -     0.29(12) $\\mu$W     0.020(16) $\\mu$W\n\nPredicted HL    -   -   -     0.29-0.39 $\\mu$W      0.012-0.023 $\\mu$W\n\nPassive heat load per line.  Passive heat load (HL) of cable types installed in the DR, as inferred from observed temperature increases after the installation of new cables into the DR. The upper and middle sections of the table refer to 0.085\" diameter stainless steel coaxial cable (UT085 SS-SS) with attenuator configurations used in drive lines and flux lines, respectively. Error bars include statistical errors between different cooldowns and systematic uncertainties in the temperature measurements. The intervals of predicted heat loads correspond to calculations of lower and upper bounds (see text).\n\nTo extract the passive heat loads for each type of line we separately cooled down the dilution refrigerator after installation of the drive line cable tree, the readout cable tree without the NbTi lines, the four NbTi output lines between the 4K stage and the MXC stage, and the flux line cable tree, respectively. From the extracted total passive heat load after each cooldown we calculate an average load per line by dividing the total loads by the number of lines in the cable tree.\n\nTo extract a mean passive load per drive line we combine the data from the cooldown of the drive line tree and the readout tree since the readout tree consists of drive lines and pump lines having the same thermalization scheme with attenuators at the 4K, CP, and MXC stages. The data is shown in the first section of Table (Table tab:passiveload).\n\nThe determined heat loads are in qualitative agreement with predictions based on Eq. <ref>, see row \"Predicted HL\" in the upper part of Table (Table tab:passiveload). The lower and upper bounds of the intervals represent estimates in which thermalization of the center conductor and dielectric on stages without attenuator (50K and Still stage) is fully achieved or not at all. In calculating the predicted passive load we have assumed that the center conductor is fully thermalized on stages with an attenuator. However, it is an open question how well the center conductor thermalizes to the CC inside an attenuator and it is likely to depend on the physical structure and thermal properties of the attenuator [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nWhile the measured loads on the 50K, 4K, Still, CP stages agree within error bars with the predicted values, the load on the MXC stage is larger than predicted. This can have several reasons.\n\nFirst, there could be discrepancies between the thermal conductivitiy of the particular stainless steel (SS) of the cables and the data used for the estimates in that temperature interval. Second, thermalization of the center conductor via the attenuator at the CP could be ineffective. Third, the long timescales for thermalization of components at MXC, in particular if they contain hydrogen [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], can lead to an overestimation of the heat load since we measure $\\Delta T_i$ always at the same time ($\\sim$1 day after the condensation of the mixture when the MXC temperature is sufficiently stable). Fourth, gas describing from newly installed components' outgassing can freeze out at MXC, creating an additional heat load.\n\nThe average passive loads per flux line on the 50K, 4K, and Still stages agree within error bars with the corresponding passive loads per drive line, see second section of Table (Table tab:passiveload). This is expected since the two types of line are nominally identical from the vacuum flange to the Still stage. The load on the CP is also comparable to the corresponding load per drive line. This observation is also expected because the additional load on the CP in case of full thermalization of the center conductor as compared to no thermalization at all is only by 0.03 $\\mu$W (0.13 $\\mu$W) larger if the closest upper stage at which the center conductor is thermalized is the Still (4K) stage. Note that this corresponds to the interval of 0.33-0.43 $\\mu$W for the predicted load per drive line as compared to the predicted load per flux line of 0.3 $\\mu$W. The intervals for the predicted loads are calculated for complete thermalization of the center conductor at the 50K and Still stages or no thermalization of the center conductor at all.\n\nThe passive load per flux line on MXC is significantly larger than the one per drive line. This is due to the absence of an attenuator in the flux line at the CP causing a direct passive load from the Still to the MXC stage via the center conductor. Thermalization of the center conductor at the Still stage is likely because otherwise a load of 0.131 $\\mu$W at MXC is expected, which is by a factor of four larger than what we measure.\n\nThe passive loads extracted from the cooldown of the four NbTi lines are listed in the third section of Table (Table tab:passiveload), showing agreement with the predictions. Since it is unclear whether a circulator helps for achieving thermalization of the center conductor we calculate lower and upper bounds for the predicted heat loads by assuming complete thermalization of the center conductor at Still and CP or no thermalization at all. However, the error bars on the measured values are too large to draw any conclusion in that respect.\n\nIn summary, after the installation of 66 RF lines, mainly UT085-SS-SS, $T_{\\rm MXC}$ increased from 6.1(1) mK to 8.4(2) mK, corresponding to a total passive heat load on MXC of $1.4(2)\\,\\mu$W. This is more than a factor of ten smaller than the available cooling power at 20 mK, and thus sets the stage for experiments with tens to hundreds of superconducting qubits.\n\n## Active load measurements\n### Drive lines\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDissipation in drive lines. Dissipated power at the temperature stages of the DR when applying a microwave tone at 5 GHz and a power of 16 dBm, corresponding to a signal level of -52.5 dBm at MXC. Shown are measured data (blue rectangles, solid line) and results of calculations (red triangles, dashed line).\n\nTo experimentally test loads due to signal dissipation we apply a RF signal at one of the drive lines, and measure the corresponding temperature increases on the stages in the dilution refrigerator. In particular, we attempt to evaluate whether the power dissipated in an attenuator predominantly flows to the stage on which the attenuator is thermalized, or whether part of that heat flows to the next lower stage. This is important because the signal levels at stages with attenuators differ by 20 dB in the selected attenuator configuration of C3={0, 20, 0, 20, 20} dB. In other words, the power dissipated in an attenuator at the 4K (CP) stage is by a factor 100 larger than the power dissipated in the attenuator at the CP (MXC) stage. Hence, if only a small fraction of heat dissipated in an attenuator at a given stage flows towards the lower temperature stages, this can significantly increase the heat load on these stages.\n\nWe first apply a power of 10 dBm at a frequency of 10 MHz, at which dissipation in the RF cables themselves is negligible. This allows for a simple comparison with the expected loads of 10 mW on the 4K stage, 100 $\\mu$W on CP, and 1 $\\mu$W on MXC. Using our reference measurements, we extract an active load of $11.5(1.6)\\,$mW on the 4K stage, 95(9) $\\mu$W on CP, 1.1(1) $\\mu$W on MXC, in agreement with the predicted values and showing that there is no significant extra load on these stages due to signal dissipation on higher stages. However, we measured a non-zero active load of 48(6) $\\mu$W on the Still stage, which we attribute to a small fraction of the dissipated power at 4K (about 0.4\n\nWe next apply a signal at 5 GHz with a power of 16 dBm such that the resulting temperature increases on the lower stages are well measurable. To calculate the power level at MXC, we have to take into account the attenuation in the cables [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], see Appendix <ref>.\n\nThe total attenuation in the cables sums up to about 8.5 dB, and with the 60 dB of discrete attenuation yields a signal level at MXC of about -52.5 dBm, much larger than the average value of -78 dBm required in a drive line, see Section <ref>. To predict an active load per drive line the extracted pure active loads shown as blue rectangles in Fig. (Figure fig:dissipation-driveline) need to be scaled down accordingly. On the stages with attenuators the data agrees well with the estimated active loads (red triangles). In our calculations we attribute one half of the dissipated power in a cable section itself (excluding the attenuators) to the stage above and the other half to the stage below. On the Still stage the measured load is by a factor two larger than estimated, which is consistent with the above observation made at a signal frequency of 10 MHz.\n\nThe active load per TWPA pump line is found to be comparable to the active load per drive line, with a dominating contribution of 0.23 $\\mu$W on the CP stage. This is a result of a pump power of about -65 dB required at the input of the TWPA and the pump line having 10 dB less attenuation than the drive lines.\n\nSummarizing, we have experimentally verified the predicted active loads for the selected attenuator configuration in the drive lines as presented in Fig. (Figure fig:signal-dissipation) b. Since this configuration has been chosen to keep the active load significantly below the available cooling powers, the active load due to execution of single-qubit gates has a negligible influence on the temperature of the quantum processor. Whether the thermal photon number is as low as predicted needs to be measured [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and would provide information about the effective temperatures at which the attenuators emit blackbody radiation.\n\n### Flux lines\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDissipation in flux lines. Dissipated power at MXC (left) and CP (right) measured as a function of current in the flux line. Solid lines are quadratic fits to the data.\n\nTo determine the active load arising from flux biasing the qubits, we terminate one of the flux lines at MXC with an electric short, apply a DC current to it, and measure the corresponding temperature increase and heat loads. While the relative temperature increases are negligibly small on the stages from room temperature to the Still, they are significant on CP and MXC. As expected we observe a quadratic increase of the extracted loads $P_{\\rm MXC/CP}=R_{\\rm eff,MXC/CP}I_{\\rm MXC}^2$ as a function of the applied current. The maximum applied current amounted to 8.8 mA at the input of the dilution refrigerator or to 4.6 mA after the 10 dB attenuator at 4K, and thus at MXC (denoted $I_{\\rm MXC}$). From quadratic fits to the data we extract $R_{\\rm eff,MXC}=0.15(1)\\,{\\rm \\Omega} = 0.15(1)\\mu{\\rm W/mA^2}$ and $R_{\\rm eff,CP}=0.42(2)\\,{\\rm \\Omega}$.\n\nThe sum of the two resistances corresponds to the resistance of a coaxial stainless steel cable with a length of 20 cm, which is a bit smaller than the cable length of 29 cm from Still to MXC. How the dissipated power in that cable distributes to the Still, CP, and MXC stages depends on details such as the thermal conductances between the center conductor, which contributes most to the resistance of the coaxial cable, and all of the stages.\n\nFor a reasonable choice of mutual inductance between flux line and qubit discussed in Section <ref>, the DC biasing currents needed to tune the qubits to the desired transition frequencies are considered to be randomly distributed in the interval $[-I_{\\rm max},I_{\\rm max}]=[-1,1]$ mA. Hence, an average power of $P_{\\rm avg}=\\frac{1}{I_{\\rm max}}\\int_0^{I_{\\rm max}} R_{\\rm eff} I_{\\rm MXC}^2\\,{\\rm d}I_{\\rm MXC} = \\frac{1}{3} R_{\\rm eff} I_{\\rm max}^2 \\approx 0.050(3)\\,\\mu$W is dissipated. For 25 flux lines this sums up to 1.25(7) $\\mu$W, which is about a factor of 15 smaller than the cooling power available at MXC at a temperature of 20 mK. We note that this is a worst-case scenario since with careful magnetic shielding it could be possible to reduce the offset fluxes to close to zero.\n\nFor an estimate of dissipation due to flux pulses used for two-qubit gates we use the measured effective DC resistances, the required current amplitude of about 0.2 mA and a duty cycle of 33\n\n## Conclusion and Outlook\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nTotal heat load budget for the operation of a 50 qubit processor. Predicted passive and active heat loads for the operation of a 50 qubit processor with individual drive and flux control. The heat loads are normalized to the measured cooling powers as presented in Table (Table tab:DR).\n\nBased on our measurements of passive and active loads we predict a total heat load on the dilution refrigerator when operating a 50 qubit processor with individual drive and flux control and with a multiplexed readout architecture allowing for simultaneous readout of sets of 6-7 qubits, see Fig. (Figure fig:totalheatbudget). Such a quantum compressor requires a total of 124 RF lines (50 drive lines, 50 flux lines, 8 output lines, 8 read-in lines, 8 TWPA pump lines), corresponding to the operation of our system at its full capacity. The largest relative loads of about 30\n\nThe material of the coaxial cables has been chosen to minimize passive heat load on all of the stages. However, instead of the standard 0.085 \" diameter coaxial cables, one could use 0.047 \" cables or even thinner. This is beneficial because the passive heat load scales with the square of the diameter, whereas the attenuation in the cable scales approximately linearly. For the proposed case of 0.047 \" SS-SS cables, the passive heat load would be reduced by almost a factor of four. Since large attenuation is desired in the drive lines, the active load due to the execution of single-qubit gates would not be increased if one reduced the attenuation of the installed attenuators accordingly. However, the dominant active load at MXC due to flux biasing of the qubits would be increased four-fold because the DC resistance of the cables scales inversely with their diameter.\n\nWe briefly discuss an optimistic scenario in which magnetic flux offsets are brought close to zero by careful magnetic shielding of the quantum processor. Disregarding thus active load due to  DC flux biasing and considering the use of 0.047 \" diameter cables, the dominant relative load on the CP stage amounts to about 13\n\nUltimately, we propose the following modifications to allow for the operation of about thousand qubits. First, we use superconducting NbTi cables for the flux lines eliminating active load in these lines. Second, we tolerate a CP temperature of about 200 mK at which a cooling power of at least 400 $\\mu$W is available. To maintain the same noise photon number of 0.001 we shift about 7 dB of attenuation from the CP to the MXC stage, increasing the active load on MXC by a factor six. Third, we tolerate a base plate temperature of 30 mK at which the cooling power at MXC is at least doubled to about 40 $\\mu$W, while not affecting the noise photon number. We note that in this optimized scenario active loads in the drive lines are the dominating heat load at CP and MXC.\n\nWe conclude with the remark that future large-scale dilution refrigerators will likely have several dilution units to provide sufficient cooling power at the CP and MXC stages.\n\n*\n\nAPPENDICES\n\n## Attenuation of different types of coaxial cables\nThe attenuation at room temperature of various types of coaxial cables is shown as a function of frequency in Fig. (Figure fig:cableAtt). At low temperature the attenuation is slightly reduced, e.g. the attenuation constant of a UT-85-SS-SS cable at 6 GHz reduces from 9.7 dB/m at room temperature to 8.2 dB/m at 4 K [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For the calculation of the thermal noise photon number and the active loads presented in Fig. (Figure fig:signal-dissipation) and in Fig. (Figure fig:dissipation-driveline) we have taken such temperature dependences to first order into account.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nAttenuation in coaxial cables at room temperature. Attenuation in indicated types of coaxial cables as a function of frequency as specified by the manufacturer [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n## Thermal conductivities of relevant materials and cables\nThe thermal conductivities of typical cryogenic cable materials are shown as a function of temperature in Fig. (Figure fig:thermalCond). The data has been used for the estimation of passive heat loads. Data for most of the materials is only available down to $4\\,$K. From 4 K to 0 K we use a linear extrapolation to zero. This is justified for metals at low temperatures, where the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity dominates [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Although the thermal conductivities of crystallized thermal insulators such as PTFE, and also of superconductors, is expected to have a $T^3$ dependence at low temperature, we make a linear interpolation to zero as an upper bound for our estimates.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nThermal conductivities. Thermal conductivity of indicated materials as a function of temperature [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] on a logarithmic scale. The upper plot shows the temperature range from 4K to 300K, the lower plot shows the range from 0.01K to 4K. Data for NbTi in the high temperature regime is taken from [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The low temperature curve of NbTi (lower plot) is created from three data points [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and a linear extrapolation to zero, see text.\n\n## S-parameters of RF lines\nTypical S-parameter response curves of the installed drive lines and flux lines are shown in Fig. (Figure fig:S_parameters) a. Each line has been measured from the port on the vacuum flange (Port 1) to the port at the MXC flange (Port 2), using a vector network analyzer (VNA). The drive lines typically achieve reflection parameters below -20dB from 0 to 12 GHz, and below -25dB in the range of 4-8 GHz, which is most relevant for the applied microwave pulses. For lines with an Eccosorb filter we choose to position it before the attenuator at MXC such that the line is well impedance matched also at Port 2 even if the Eccosorb filter itself is not perfectly impedance matched.\n\nThe transmission coefficients confirm that the signal loss at DC frequencies is set by the installed attenuators (3x 20dB). For higher frequencies, the transmission coefficients decrease as expected due to the frequency dependent signal loss in the cables and Eccosorb filter.\n\nThe transmission spectrum of the flux line starts at -10 dB, corresponding to the 10 dB attenuator installed at the 4K stage, and sharply drops at $2\\,$GHz due to a low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1.3 GHz, see Fig. (Figure fig:S_parameters) b. The continuous drop between 0 and 2 GHz is due to a combination of frequency dependent loss in cable and Eccosorb filter. The reflection S22 from the sample side towards the Eccosorb filter is below -20 dB in the range of 0-500 MHz. Since this range is larger than the typical bandwidth of a flux pulse, possible multiple reflections of flux pulses between the sample and the Eccosorb filter are significantly suppressed.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nTypical S-parameters of installed RF lines. a) Example of a drive line with a total of 60 dB attenuation and an Eccosorb filter having an attenuation of $\\sim 5\\,$dB at 5 GHz. b) Example of a flux line with 10 dB attenuation, a low pass filter (Minicircuits VLFX1350), and an Eccosorb filter with an attenuation of $\\sim 3\\,$dB at 1 GHz $(\\sim 20\\,$dB at 5 GHz).\n\n## Temperature sensors and heaters\nWe use a PT100 temperature sensor at 50K, Cernox CX-1010 sensors at 4K and Still, and RuO2 RX-102B sensors at CP and MXC (all sensors are from Lake Shore Cryotronics). All except the sensor at CP were pre-installed by the manufacturer. The sensors are read out using the temperature controller model 372 from Lake Shore. We also installed resistive heaters on stages that had no heater installed by the manufacturer, i.e. on the 50K and the CP stage. On the 50K stage we installed a 25 $\\Omega$, 100 W cartridge heater (HTR-50, Lakeshore)  We use resistive cartridge heaters from Lakeshore Cryogenics. On the 50K stage we installed a 25 $\\Omega$, 100 W heater (HTR-25-100), whereas on the CP we installed a  50 $\\Omega$, 50 W heater (HTR-50). For mounting, the cartridge heaters are clamped in a circular hole in a rectangular Cu piece that is then mounted to the corresponding plate in the cryostat.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThe authors thank Y.

The evolution of\nthe amplitude is\n\n\u03b1\u0307_\u00b1= -i (\u0394_rd \u00b1\u03c7)  \u03b1_\u00b1\n-\u03ba/2  \u03b1_\u00b1 -i\u03b5_r,\n\nwhere the upper sign everywhere is for the state $|e\\rangle$,\n\u0394_rd = \u03c9_r-\u03c9_d,\nand complex $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r} (t)$ can in general depend on time to\ndescribe a drive with changing amplitude and frequency. (Note a difference in notation compared with the main text: now $\\Delta_{\\rm rd}$ does not depend on the qubit state and the frequency shift $\\pm \\chi$ is added explicitly.) The steady\nstate for a steady drive, $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}= {\\rm const}$, is\n\u03b1_\u00b1= -i\u03b5_r/\u03ba/2+i(\u0394_rd \u00b1\u03c7),\nso that the two coherent states are separated by\n\u03b1_+ -\u03b1_- = -2\u03b5_r\u03c7/(\u03ba/2+i\u0394_rd)^2+\u03c7^2,\nand this is the difference, which can be sensed by the homodyne\ndetection (it does not matter whether the microwave is transmitted or reflected from the resonator when we discuss the measurement in terms of $\\alpha_{\\pm}$).\n\nIn the case when $\\Delta_{\\rm rd}=0$ (so that $\\omega_{\\rm\nd}=\\omega_{\\rm r}$), both states have the same average number of\nphotons, $\\bar{n}=|\\alpha_+|^2=|\\alpha_-|^2=|\\varepsilon_{\\rm\nr}|^2/(\\kappa^2/4+\\chi^2)$, and the absolute value of the state\nseparation is\n\u03b4\u03b1\u2261| \u03b1_+ -\u03b1_-|= 2 \u221a(n\u0305)/\u221a((\u03ba/2\u03c7)^2+1).\n\nTheoretically, the distinguishability of two coherent states separated by\n$\\delta\\alpha$ is the same as the distinguishability of two Gaussians\nwith width (standard deviation) of 1/2 each, separated by\n$\\delta\\alpha$. However, a measurement for the duration $t_{\\rm m}$\nincreases the effective separation by a factor of $\\sqrt{\\kappa\nt_{\\rm m}}$, while imperfect quantum efficiency $\\eta$ of the\nmeasurement (mainly due to the amplifier noise) increases the\nGaussian width by $\\eta^{-1/2}$ or, equivalently, decreases the\neffective separation by $\\eta^{-1/2}$. Therefore, we may think about the\ndistinguishability of two Gaussians with width 1/2 each, separated\nby\n\u03b4\u03b1_eff = \u221a(\u03b7\u03bat_m)\n\u03b4\u03b1,\nwhich gives the error probability due to state separation\nP_err^sep=1-Erf(\u03b4\u03b1_eff/\u221a(2))/2 \u2248exp[-(\u03b4\u03b1_eff)^2/2]/\u221a(2\u03c0) \u03b4\u03b1_eff  .\n\nThe other contribution to the measurement error $P_{\\rm err}$ for the state $|e\\rangle$ comes\nfrom the qubit energy relaxation with the rate $\\Gamma+T_{1,\\rm\nint}^{-1}$ during the measurement time $t_{\\rm m}$,\nP_err=  P_err^sep + 1/2  t_m (\u0393+T_1,int^-1),\nwhere the factor $1/2$ is because the relaxation moment is distributed practically uniformly within the measurement duration $t_{\\rm m}$.\nSince $P_{\\rm err}^{\\rm sep}$ decreases with time $t_{\\rm m}$\nexponentially, the main limitation for $P_{\\rm err}$ comes from the\nsecond term.\n\nIt is easy to find that $ P_{\\rm err}^{\\rm sep}=10^{-2}$ corresponds\nto $\\delta\\alpha_{\\rm eff}=2.3$, $ P_{\\rm err}^{\\rm sep}=10^{-3}$\ncorresponds to $\\delta\\alpha_{\\rm eff}=3.1$, and $ P_{\\rm err}^{\\rm\nsep}=10^{-4}$ corresponds to $\\delta\\alpha_{\\rm eff}=3.7$. For an\nestimate let us choose $\\delta\\alpha_{\\rm eff}\\agt 3$. Then from\nEq. (<ref>) $t_{\\rm m}\\agt\n9/(\\eta\\kappa\\,\\delta\\alpha^2)$, and therefore even neglecting\nintrinsic relaxation $T_{1,\\rm int}^{-1}$ in Eq. (<ref>), we\nobtain the condition\n\u03931/4 P_err\u03b7\u03ba(\u03b4\u03b1)^2.\nNow using $\\Gamma=\\kappa g^2/\\Delta^2$ and assuming $\\kappa \\agt 2\\, |\\chi |$\nin Eq. (<ref>), so that $\\delta\\alpha \\simeq 4\\chi\n\\sqrt{\\nbar}/\\kappa$,\nwe rewrite this condition as\n\u03ba2 \u221a(P_err\u03b7)   |\u03c7|/|g|  \u22432 \u221a(P_err\u03b7)\n|g\u03b4_q|/|\u0394|,\nwhere for the second expression we used $\\chi \\simeq -g^2\\delta_{\\rm q}/\\Delta^2$.\nSince the measurement time $t_{\\rm m}$ should be at least few times\nlonger than $\\kappa^{-1}$, we obtain\nt_m >4/\u03ba 2/\u221a(P_err\u03b7)   |\u0394|/|g\u03b4_q| =4/\u03b4_q/\u221a(P_err\u03b7)\u221a(/n_crit).\n\nThese estimates show that the Purcell effect requires a sufficiently long measurement time when we desire a small measurement error $P_{\\rm err}$. The limitation is not severe, but it is still inconsistent with a fast accurate measurement needed for quantum error correction. As an example, from Eq. (<ref>) we see that for $\\delta_{\\rm q}/2\\pi\\simeq 200\\, {\\rm MHz}$, $P_{\\rm err}\\simeq 10^{-3}$, $\\eta \\simeq 0.3$ and $\\nbar \\simeq n_{\\rm crit}/4$ we need $t_m >400\\,{\\rm ns}$ (this in turn would require a very long $T_{1, \\rm int}$). Also, the detuning should be sufficiently large,\n|\u0394/g|>\u221a(\u03bat_m/2P_err)>\u221a(2/P_err),\nas directly follows from $\\Gamma =\\kappa (g/\\Delta)^2$ and $\\kappa t_{\\rm m} >4$.\n\nAs a more detailed example, let us choose $g/2\\pi \\simeq 30\\, {\\rm MHz}$, $\\Delta/2\\pi \\simeq -1.35\\, {\\rm GHz}$, $\\delta_{\\rm q}/2\\pi\\simeq 200\\, {\\rm MHz}$, $\\kappa^{-1}\\simeq 100 \\, {\\rm ns}$, $t_{\\rm m}\\simeq 400 \\, {\\rm ns}$, $\\eta\\simeq 0.3$, and $\\nbar\\simeq n_{\\rm crit}/4\\simeq 125$. Then for the excited qubit state the Purcell decay brings the error contribution $t_{\\rm m}\\Gamma /2\\simeq 10^{-3}$; the dispersive coupling is $\\chi /2\\pi \\simeq -0.1 \\, {\\rm MHz}$, so $\\delta \\alpha \\simeq 0.25\\sqrt{\\nbar}\\simeq 2.8$ and $\\delta\\alpha_{\\rm eff}\\simeq 3$, so the separation error is also about $10^{-3}$ [actually slightly larger since $|\\chi|$ decreases with $\\nbar$ for negative $\\Delta$ \u2013 see Eq. (<ref>)].\n\nThus, we see that even with the qubit decay due to the Purcell effect, it is possible to measure a qubit with a low measurement error, but this requires a relatively long time and large resonator-qubit detuning. Note that we also had to assume a large number of photons in the resonator, which can lead to detrimental effects (neglected in our analysis) such as dressed dephasing [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and various imperfections related to nonlinear dynamics. Suppression of the Purcell effect (using a Purcell filter or other means) allows us to significantly increase the ratio $|g/\\Delta|$, thus increasing the coupling $\\chi$ and correspondingly decreasing the measurement time for the same measurement error.\n\n99\n\nN-C-book M.

Superconducting quantum computing technology [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is currently approaching the threshold for quantum error correction. Compared with the recent rapid progress in the increase of single-qubit and two-qubit gate fidelities, qubit measurement shows somewhat slower progress. The development of faster and higher-fidelity qubit readout remains an important task.\n\nIn circuit QED (cQED) [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the qubit state\nis inferred by measuring the state-dependent frequency shift of the\nresonator via homodyne detection. This method introduces an unwanted\ndecay channel [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for the qubit due to the energy\nleakage through the resonator into the transmission line, the\nprocess known as the Purcell effect [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThe Purcell effect is one of the limiting factors for high fidelity\nqubit readout.\n\nIn principle, the Purcell rate can be suppressed by increasing the\nqubit-resonator detuning, decreasing the qubit-resonator coupling,\nor decreasing the resonator bandwidth due to damping. However,\nthese simple methods increase the time needed to measure the qubit.\nThis leads to a trade-off between the qubit relaxation and\nmeasurement time, whereas it is desirable to suppress the Purcell rate\nwithout compromising qubit measurement. Several proposals have been\nput forward for this purpose, which include employing a Purcell\nfilter [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], engineering a Purcell-protected\nqubit [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], or using a tunable coupler that\ndecouples the transmission line from the resonator during the\nqubit-resonator interaction, thereby avoiding the Purcell effect\naltogether [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe general idea of the Purcell filter is to impede the propagation of\nthe photon emitted at the qubit frequency, compared with propagation\nof the microwave field at the resonator frequency, used for the\nqubit measurement. A notch (band-rejection) filter detuned by 1.7\nGHz from the resonator frequency was realized in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nA factor of 50 reduction in the Purcell rate was demonstrated when\nthe qubit frequency was placed in the rejection band of the filter.\nA bandpass filter with the quality factor $Q_{\\rm f}\\simeq 30$ (and\ncorresponding bandwidth of 0.22 GHz) centered near the\nresonator frequency was used in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This\nallowed the qubit measurement within 140 ns with fidelities\n$F_{|1\\rangle}=98.7$ and $F_{|0\\rangle}=99.3$ for the two qubit\nstates. (The bandpass Purcell filter was also used in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]; it\nhad a similar design with a few minor changes.) A major advantage of\nthe bandpass Purcell filter in comparison with the notch filter is\nthe possibility to keep strongly reduced Purcell rate for qubits\nwith practically any frequency (except near the filter frequency),\nthus allowing quantum gates based on tuning the qubit frequency,\nand also allowing multiplexed readout of several qubits by placing\nreadout resonators with different frequencies within the filter\nbandwidth.\n\nIn this work, we analyze the Purcell filter of Ref.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] using both semiclassical and quantum approaches\nand considering both the weak and the strong drive regimes. Our\nsemiclassical analysis uses somewhat different language compared\nto the analysis in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]; however, the results are\nvery similar (they show that with the filter the Purcell rate can be\nsuppressed by two orders of magnitude, while maintaining the same\nmeasurement time). The results of the quantum analysis in the regime\nof a weak measurement drive or no drive (considering the\nsingle-photon subspace) practically coincide with the semiclassical\nresults. In the presence of strong microwave drive, the Purcell rate\nis further suppressed with increasing drive strength. We have found\nthat this suppression is stronger than that obtained without a\nfilter [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn Sec. II we discuss the general idea of the bandpass Purcell\nfilter and analyze its operation semiclassically. Section III is\ndevoted to the quantum calculation of the Purcell rate in the\npresence of the bandpass Purcell filter. In Sec. IV we discuss further\nsuppression of the Purcell rate due to an applied microwave drive.\nSection V is the Conclusion. In the appendix we review the basic theory of a\ntransmon/Xmon qubit measurement, the Purcell decay, and the\ncorresponding measurement error without the Purcell filter.\n\n## Idea of a bandpass Purcell filter and semiclassical analysis\nIn the standard cQED setup of dispersive measurement (Fig.(Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r)) the qubit interaction with the resonator slightly\nchanges the effective resonator frequency depending on the qubit\nstate, so that it is $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}$ when the qubit is\nin the excited state and $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle}$ when the qubit\nis in the ground state. The dispersive coupling $\\chi$ is defined as\n\u03c7\u2261(\u03c9_r^|e\u27e9-\u03c9_r^|g\u27e9)/2 .\nIn the two-level approximation for the qubit, $\\chi=g^2/(\\omega_{\\rm\nq}^{\\rm b}-\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b})$, where $g$ is the\nqubit-resonator coupling and $\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}$ and\n$\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}$ are the bare frequencies of the qubit and\nthe resonator, respectively [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For a transmon or an Xmon qubit,\n$\\chi$ is usually significantly smaller, $\\chi \\approx -g^2\n\\delta_{\\rm q}/[(\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm\nb})(\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-\\delta_{\\rm q}-\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b})]$,\nwhere $\\delta_{\\rm q}$ is the qubit anharmonicity ($\\delta_{\\rm q}>0$); moreover, $\\chi$\nas well as the central frequency $(\\omega_{\\rm\nr}^{|e\\rangle}+\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle})/2$ depend on the number\nof photons $n$ in the resonator (see [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and the Appendix for a more detailed discussion). The resonator frequency change (and thus the qubit state) is sensed by applying the microwave field with amplitude $\\varepsilon$, then amplifying the transmitted or reflected signal, and then mixing it with the applied microwave field to measure its phase and amplitude (Fig. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r)).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency $\\omega_{\\rm r}$ (due to qubit-resonator interaction with strength $g$), and this is sensed by passing the microwave through (or reflecting from) the resonator. The amplified outgoing microwave is combined with the local oscillator at the mixer, whose output is measured to discriminate the qubit states. The energy decay $\\kappa$ of the resonator is mainly due to its coupling with the transmission line.\n\nIn the process of measurement, the qubit decays with the Purcell\nrate [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n\u0393\u2248\u03ba\ng^2/(\u03c9_q-\u03c9_r)^2,\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the resonator energy damping rate (mostly due to leakage into the transmission line \u2013 see Fig. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r)). Note that in this formula we do\nnot distinguish the bare and effective frequencies. In the quantum\nlanguage this can be interpreted as the leakage with the rate\n$\\kappa$ of the qubit \u201ctail\u201d $g^2/(\\omega_{\\rm q}-\\omega_{\\rm\nr})^2$, existing in the form of the resonator photon. However, the\nPurcell decay also has a simple classical interpretation via the resistive damping\n[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], essentially being a linear effect, in contrast to\nthe dispersion (<ref>) \u2013 see Appendix for more\ndetails, including dependence of $\\Gamma$ on $n$ [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe Purcell decay leads to measurement error; therefore, it is\nimportant to reduce the rate $\\Gamma$. This can be done by\ndecreasing the ratio $g/|\\omega_{\\rm q}-\\omega_{\\rm r}|$; however,\nthis decreases $\\chi$ and thus increases the necessary measurement\ntime $t_{\\rm m}$ (see Appendix for more details). Another way to\ndecrease $\\Gamma$ is to use a very small leakage rate $\\kappa$;\nhowever, this also increases the measurement time $t_{\\rm m}$\nbecause the ring-up and ring-down processes give a natural\nlimitation $t_{\\rm m} \\agt 4\\,\\kappa^{-1}$, and in many practical\ncases it is even $t_{\\rm m} \\gg 10 \\,\\kappa^{-1}$.\n\nIt would be good if the rate $\\kappa$ which governs the measurement time were\ndifferent from $\\kappa$ in Eq. (<ref>): specifically if\n$\\kappa$ for the Purcell decay were much smaller than $\\kappa$ for the measurement. This\nis exactly what is achieved by using the bandpass filter of Ref.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. There are other ways to explain how this Purcell\nfilter works [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], but here we interpret the main idea\nof the bandpass Purcell filter as producing different effective\nrates $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ for the measurement and for the Purcell decay (so\nthat the measurement microwave easily passes through the filter,\nwhile the propagation of the photon emitted by the qubit is strongly\nimpeded by the filter).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nQubit measurement schematic with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter  of Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The readout resonator with\nfrequency $\\omega_{\\rm r}$ (which depends on the qubit state) is\ncoupled (coupling $\\mathcal{G}$) with a filter resonator of\nfrequency $\\omega_{\\rm f}$, which decays into the transmission line\nwith the rate $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$. The further processing of the\noutgoing microwave (not shown) is the same as in Fig. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r).\nThe microwave drive can be applied either to the readout\n($\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$) or to the filter ($\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}$)\nresonators. Coupling with the decaying filter resonator produces an\neffective decay rate $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ of the readout resonator,\nwhich depends on the drive frequency. As a result, for the\nmeasurement microwave $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}=\\kappa_{\\rm r}$, while the\nqubit sees a much smaller value $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}=\\kappa_{\\rm q}$,\nthus leading to a suppression of the qubit Purcell decay by a factor $\\kappa_{\\rm q}/\\kappa_{\\rm r}$.\n\nThe schematic of the qubit measurement with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter of Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is shown in Fig. (Figure: Qubit measurement schematic with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter  of Ref. <cit.>).\nBesides the readout resonator with qubit-state-dependent frequency $\\omega_{\\rm\nr}=\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}$ or $\\omega_{\\rm r}=\\omega_{\\rm\nr}^{|g\\rangle}$, there is a second (filter)\nresonator with frequency $\\omega_{\\rm f}$, coupled with the readout\nresonator with the coupling $\\mathcal{G}$. (The coupling\n$\\mathcal{G}$ is inductive, but we draw it as capacitive to keep the figure simple.) The filter resonator leaks the microwave into the\ntransmission line with a relatively large damping rate $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$, so\nthat its $Q$-factor is $Q_{\\rm f}=\\omega_{\\rm f}/\\kappa_{\\rm f}\n\\simeq 30$, while $|\\mathcal{G}|\\ll \\kappa_{\\rm f}$. The leaked\nfield is then amplified and sent to the mixer (not shown) in the\nsame way as in the standard cQED setup. The readout and filter\nresonators are in general detuned from each other, but not much,\n$|\\omega_{\\rm r}-\\omega_{\\rm f}|\\alt \\kappa_{\\rm f}$ (detuning is needed to\nmultiplex readout of several qubits using the same filter resonator\n[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]; for simplicity we consider the measurement of only one qubit). The filter resonator is pumped with the\ndrive frequency $\\omega_{\\rm d}$ (close to $\\omega_{\\rm r}$) and\namplitude $\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}$. However, for us it will be easier\nto first assume instead that the readout resonator is pumped with\namplitude $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$ (Fig. (Figure: Qubit measurement schematic with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter  of Ref. <cit.>)), and then show\nthe correspondence between the drives $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$ and\n$\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}$.\n\nLet us use the rotating wave approximation [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] with the rotating frame $e^{-i\\omega_d t}$ based on the drive\nfrequency $\\omega_{\\rm d}$. Then the evolution of the classical\nfield amplitudes $\\alpha (t)$ and $\\beta (t)$ in the readout and\nfilter resonators, respectively, is given by the equations\n$$\n\n& \\dot {\\alpha} =-i\\Delta_{\\rm rd} \\alpha -i\\mathcal{G}\\beta\n-i\\varepsilon_{\\rm r} ,\n\\label{alpha-dot-1} \\\\\n&  \\dot {\\beta} = -i\\Delta_{\\rm fd}\\beta -i\\mathcal{G}^*\\alpha\n-\\frac{\\kappa_{\\rm f}}{2}\\, \\beta , \\label{beta-dot-1}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are normalized so that $|\\alpha|^2$ and\n$|\\beta|^2$ are the average number of photons in the resonators,\n$\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$ is normalized correspondingly, and\n\u0394_rd = \u03c9_r- \u03c9_d,\n\u0394_fd = \u03c9_f- \u03c9_d\n(recall that $\\omega_{\\rm r}$ depends on the qubit state). If we are\nnot interested in the details of evolution on the fast time scale\n$\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{-1}$, then we can use the quasisteady state for\n$\\beta$ [obtained from Eq. (<ref>) using $\\dot \\beta=0$],\n\u03b2= -i \ud835\udca2^*/\u03ba_f/2 + i \u0394_fd  \u03b1,\nwhich can then be inserted into Eq. (<ref>), giving\n$$\n\n&& \\dot {\\alpha} = -i(\\Delta_{\\rm rd}+\\delta \\omega_{\\rm r}) \\,\n\\alpha -\\frac{\\kappa_{\\rm eff}}{2} \\, \\alpha -i\\varepsilon_{\\rm r},\n\\label{alpha-dot-2}\\\\\n&& \\kappa_{\\rm eff} = \\frac{4 |\\mathcal{G}|^2}{\\kappa_{\\rm f}} \\,\n\\frac{1}{1+(2\\Delta_{\\rm fd}/\\kappa_{\\rm f})^2} ,\n\\label{kappa-eff}\\\\\n&& \\delta\\omega_{\\rm r} = - \\frac{ |\\mathcal{G}|^2  \\Delta_{\\rm\nfd}}{(\\kappa_{\\rm f} /2)^2 +\\Delta_{\\rm fd}^2}=-\\frac{\\Delta_{\\rm\nfd}}{\\kappa_{\\rm f}}\\, \\kappa_{\\rm eff} .\n\\label{delta-omega-r}\n\n$$\nThus we see that the field $\\alpha$ evolves in practically the same\nway as in the standard setup of Fig. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r); however,\ninteraction with the filter resonator shifts the readout resonator\nfrequency by $\\delta\\omega_{\\rm r}$  and introduces the effective\nleakage rate $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ of the readout resonator.\n\nMost importantly, $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ depends on the drive frequency.\nFor measurement we use $\\omega_{\\rm d} \\approx \\omega_{\\rm r}$, so\n$\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ is approximately\n\u03ba_r \u22614 |\ud835\udca2|^2/\u03ba_f\n1/1+[2(\u03c9_r-\u03c9_f)/\u03ba_f]^2 .\nHowever, when the qubit tries to leak its excitation through the\nreadout resonator, this can be considered as a drive at the qubit\nfrequency, $\\omega_{\\rm d}=\\omega_{\\rm q}$, and the corresponding\n$\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ is then\n\u03ba_q \u22614 |\ud835\udca2|^2/\u03ba_f\n1/1+[2(\u03c9_q-\u03c9_f)/\u03ba_f]^2,\nwhich is much smaller than $\\kappa_{\\rm r}$ if the qubit is detuned\naway from the filter linewidth, $|\\omega_{\\rm q}-\\omega_{\\rm f}| \\gg\n\\kappa_{\\rm f}$. This difference is exactly what we wished for  suppressing the\nPurcell rate $\\Gamma$: the measurement is governed by $\\kappa_{\\rm\nr}$, while the qubit sees a much smaller value $\\kappa_{\\rm q}$.\nTherefore, we would expect that the Purcell rate is given by Eq.(<ref>) with $\\kappa=\\kappa_{\\rm q}$ [see Eq. (<ref>) later], while the\n\u201cseparation\u201d measurement error is given by Eqs.(<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) with $\\kappa=\\kappa_{\\rm r}$\n(see Appendix). As a result, compared with the standard setup (Fig.(Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r)) with the same physical parameters for measurement, the\nPurcell rate is suppressed by the factor\nF= \u03ba_q/\u03ba_r =\n1+[2(\u03c9_r-\u03c9_f)/\u03ba_f]^2/1+[2(\u03c9_q-\u03c9_f)/\u03ba_f]^2 \u226a1.\nThis is essentially the main result of this paper, which will\nbe confirmed by the quantum analysis in the next section. (To avoid a possible confusion, we note that $\\kappa_{\\rm q}$ is not the qubit decay rate; it is the resonator decay, as seen by the qubit.)\n\nOur result for the Purcell suppression factor was based on the\nbehavior of the field amplitude in the readout resonator. Let us\nalso check that the field $\\gamma_{\\rm tl}$ propagating in the outgoing\ntransmission line behaves according to the effective model as well.\nThe outgoing field amplitude is $\\gamma_{\\rm tl}=\\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm\nf}}\\, \\beta$ (in the normalization for which $|\\gamma_{\\rm tl}|^2$ is\nthe average number of propagating photons per second). Using Eq.(<ref>), we find\n\u03b3_tl = -i \ud835\udca2^* \u221a(\u03ba_f)/\u03ba_f/2 + i \u0394_fd  \u03b1= e^i \u03c6\n\u221a(\u03ba_eff)   \u03b1,\nso, as expected, the outgoing amplitude behaves as in the standard\nsetup of Fig. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r) with $\\kappa=\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$, up to an\nunimportant phase shift $\\varphi= {\\rm arg} [-i\n\\mathcal{G}^*/(\\kappa_{\\rm f}/2 + i \\Delta_{\\rm fd})]$. Note that to\nshow the equivalence between the dynamics (including transients) of\nthe systems in Figs. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r) and (Figure: Qubit measurement schematic with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter  of Ref. <cit.>) we needed the\nassumption of a sufficiently large $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ in order to use\nthe quasisteady state (<ref>). However, this assumption is\nnot needed if we consider only the steady state (without\ntransients).\n\nSo far we assumed that the measurement is performed by driving the\nreadout resonator with the amplitude $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$. Now let\nus consider the realistic case [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] when the\ndrive $\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}$ is applied to the filter resonator. The evolution equations (<ref>) and (<ref>) for the classical field amplitudes are then replaced by\n$$\n\n& \\dot {\\alpha} =-i\\Delta_{\\rm rd} \\alpha -i\\mathcal{G}\\beta ,\n\\label{alpha-dot-3} \\\\\n&  \\dot {\\beta} = -i\\Delta_{\\rm fd}\\beta -i\\mathcal{G}^*\\alpha\n-\\frac{\\kappa_{\\rm f}}{2}\\, \\beta -i\\varepsilon_{\\rm f} ,\n\\label{beta-dot-3}\n\n$$\nso that the quasisteady state for the filter resonator is\n\u03b2= -i \ud835\udca2^* /\u03ba_f/2 + i \u0394_fd  \u03b1+  -i\u03b5_f/\u03ba_f/2 + i \u0394_fd ,\nand the field evolution in the readout resonator is\n\u03b1\u0307 = -i(\u0394_rd+\u03b4\u03c9_r)\n\u03b1-\u03ba_eff/2   \u03b1-\n\ud835\udca2/\u03ba_f/2 + i \u0394_fd\n\u03b5_f,\n\nwith the same $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ and $\\delta\\omega_{\\rm r}$  given\nby Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>). The only\ndifference between the effective evolution equations\n(<ref>) and (<ref>) is a linear relation,\n\u03b5_r \u2194-i  \u03b5_f\n\ud835\udca2 /(\u03ba_f/2 + i \u0394_fd),\nbetween the\ndrive amplitudes $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}$\nproducing the same effect. Therefore, our results obtained above remain\nunchanged for driving the filter resonator, and the Purcell rate\nsuppression factor is still given by Eq. (<ref>).\n\nNote that in the quasisteady state the separation between the filter\namplitudes $\\beta$ for the two qubit states does not depend on\nwhether the drive is applied to the filter or readout  resonator, as\nlong as we use the correspondence (<ref>) between the drive\namplitudes. The same is true for the separation between the outgoing\nfields $\\gamma_{\\rm tl}$. Similarly, the separation between the\noutgoing fields for the two qubit states is the same (up to  the\nphase $\\varphi$) as in the standard setup of Fig. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r) with\n$\\varepsilon=\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$, $\\kappa =\\kappa_{\\rm r}$, and the\nresonator frequency adjusted by $\\delta\\omega_{\\rm r}$ given by Eq.(<ref>). Therefore, these configurations are\nequivalent to each other from the point of view of quantum\nmeasurement, including interaction between the qubit and readout\nresonator, extraction of quantum information, back-action, etc.\n\nNevertheless, driving the filter resonator produces a different\noutgoing field $\\gamma_{\\rm tl}=\\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm f}}\\, \\beta$,\nwhich now contains an additional term $-i\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}\n\\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm f}} / (\\kappa_{\\rm f}/2 + i \\Delta_{\\rm fd})$ in\ncomparison with Eq. (<ref>), which comes from the second\nterm in Eq. (<ref>). In particular, instead of the\nLorentzian line shape of the transfer function when driving the\nreadout resonator, the transfer function for driving the filter is\n(in the steady state)\n\u03b3_tl^(f)/\u03b5_f=\n\u221a(\u03ba_f)/\u03ba_f/2+i\u0394_fd\n2\u0394_rd/\u03ba_eff/1 +2i (\u0394_rd+\u03b4\u03c9_r)/\u03ba_eff,\nwhere $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ can be replaced with $\\kappa_{\\rm r}$. (Note a non-standard normalization of the transfer function because of different normalizations of $\\gamma_{\\rm tl}^{\\rm (f)}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}$.) This\nline shape for the amplitude $|\\gamma_{\\rm tl}^{\\rm (f)}/\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}|$ shows a dip near $\\omega_{\\rm r}$ (note that $\\gamma_{\\rm\ntl}^{\\rm (f)}/\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}=0$ at $\\omega_{\\rm d}=\\omega_{\\rm\nr}$) and is  significantly asymmetric when $\\delta\\omega_{\\rm r}$ is\ncomparable to $\\kappa_{\\rm r}$; this occurs when the detuning\nbetween the readout and filter resonators is comparable to\n$\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ \u2013 see Eq. (<ref>). In terms of the\nfield $\\alpha$ in the readout resonator, the outgoing field at\nsteady state is\n\u03b3_tl^(f) = - \u221a(\u03ba_f)\n\u0394_rd/\ud835\udca2   \u03b1\ninstead of Eq. (<ref>) for driving the readout resonator.\n\nThe difference between the outgoing fields  $\\gamma_{\\rm tl}^{\\rm (f)}$ and  $\\gamma_{\\rm tl}^{\\rm (r)}$ when driving the filter or readout resonator (for the same $\\alpha$, i.e., the same measurement conditions) may be important for saturation of the microwave amplifier. The ratio of the corresponding outgoing\npowers is\n| \u03b3_tl^(f)|^2/| \u03b3_tl^(r)|^2 = (\u0394_rd/\u03ba_r)^2 4/1+(2\u0394_fd /\u03ba_f)^2  ,\n\nwhere we assumed $|\\Delta_{\\rm rd}|\\ll\n\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ (so that $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}\\approx \\kappa_{\\rm r}$).\nFor example, if the drive frequency is chosen as $\\omega_{\\rm\nd}=(\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle}+\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle})/2$, then\n$\\Delta_{\\rm rd}=\\pm \\chi$; if in this case $|\\chi| \\ll \\kappa_{\\rm\nr}$, then driving the filter resonator is advantageous because it\nproduces less power to be amplified, while driving the readout\nresonator is advantageous if $|\\chi| \\gg \\kappa_{\\rm r}$. However,\nwhen $\\omega_{\\rm d} \\neq (\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle}+\\omega_{\\rm\nr}^{|e\\rangle})/2$, the situation is more complicated.\n\nFigure (Figure: Phase-space transient evolution of qubit-state-dependent\ncoherent states in the filter resonator for driving either the\nreadout resonator (red curves, left) or the filter (blue curves, right), with the\ndrive amplitudes related via Eq. (<ref>) shows the transient phase-space evolution $\\beta\n(t)$ of the field (coherent state) in the filter resonator when a\nstep-function drive is applied to the readout resonator (red curves)\nor to the filter resonator (blue curves), with the drive amplitudes\nrelated via Eq. (<ref>), and for real $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$. The\nsolid curves show the evolution when the qubit is in the excited\nstate, while the dashed curves are for the qubit in the ground\nstate. We have used parameters similar to the experimental\nparameters of Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]: $\\omega_{\\rm\nr}^{|e\\rangle}/2\\pi=6.8$ GHz, $\\omega_{\\rm\nr}^{|g\\rangle}/2\\pi=6.803$ GHz (so that $2\\chi/2\\pi=-3$ MHz),\n$\\omega_{\\rm f}/2\\pi = 6.75$ GHz, $Q_{\\rm f}=30$ (so that\n$\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{-1}= 0.71$ ns), and $\\kappa_{\\rm r}^{-1}=30$ ns (so\nthat $\\mathcal{G}/2\\pi =18.9$ MHz). The field evolution is\ncalculated using either Eqs.(<ref>)\u2013(<ref>) or Eqs.(<ref>)\u2013(<ref>); in simulations we have\nneglected the dependence of $\\chi$ and $(\\omega_{\\rm\nr}^{|e\\rangle}+\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle})/2$ on the average number\nof photons $\\bar n_{\\rm r}=|\\alpha |^2$ in the readout resonator (see Appendix).\nThe black dots indicate the time moments every 10 ns between 0 and\n100 ns, and then every 50 ns. The circles illustrate the coherent\nstate error circles [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] in the steady state. We see that when the drive is applied to\nthe filter resonator (blue curves), the evolution $\\beta (t)$ is\ninitially very fast (governed by $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$), while after the\nquasisteady state is reached, the evolution is governed by a much\nslower $\\kappa_{\\rm r}$, eventually approaching the steady state.\nWhen the drive is applied to the readout resonator (red curves), the\ntransient evolution is always governed by the slower decay\n$\\kappa_{\\rm r}$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nPhase-space transient evolution of qubit-state-dependent\ncoherent states in the filter resonator for driving either the\nreadout resonator (red curves, left) or the filter (blue curves, right), with the\ndrive amplitudes related via Eq.

(<ref>)(a) we choose the drive frequency $\\omega_{\\rm\nd}$ symmetrically from the point of view of the readout resonator\nfield, so that in the steady state $\\bar{n}_{\\rm\nr}^{|g\\rangle}=\\bar{n}_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}=50$, where $\\bar{n}_{\\rm\nr}^{|g\\rangle}$ and $\\bar{n}_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}$ are the average\nphoton numbers for the two qubit states.

Such symmetric choice of the drive frequency provides\nthe largest separation between the two coherent states for a fixed\ndrive amplitude if $2 \\,|\\chi|<\\kappa_{\\rm r}$. While the field in\nthe readout resonator is always symmetric in this case, Fig.(Figure: Phase-space transient evolution of qubit-state-dependent\ncoherent states in the filter resonator for driving either the\nreadout resonator (red curves, left) or the filter (blue curves, right), with the\ndrive amplitudes related via Eq. (<ref>)(a) shows that the field in the filter resonator is\nsymmetric only when driving the readout resonator (red curves,\n$\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|g\\rangle}=\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|e\\rangle}=1.2$),\nwhile it is strongly asymmetric when the filter resonator is driven (blue\ncurves, $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|g\\rangle}=0.01$, $\\bar{n}_{\\rm\nf}^{|e\\rangle}=1.0$; $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|g\\rangle}$ is very small\nbecause for our parameters $\\delta\\omega_{\\rm r}\\approx |\\chi|$ and therefore $\\omega_{\\rm d}\\approx \\omega_{\\rm\nr}^{|g\\rangle}$). The number of photons in the filter is much less\nthan in the readout resonator because $\\kappa_{\\rm f} \\gg\n\\kappa_{\\rm r}$.\n\nIn Fig. (Figure: Phase-space transient evolution of qubit-state-dependent\ncoherent states in the filter resonator for driving either the\nreadout resonator (red curves, left) or the filter (blue curves, right), with the\ndrive amplitudes related via Eq. (<ref>)(b) we choose $\\omega_{\\rm d}$ so that in the\nsteady state $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|g\\rangle}=\\bar{n}_{\\rm\nf}^{|e\\rangle}$ for driving the filter; this is the natural choice\nfor decreasing the microwave power to be amplified. This occurs at\n$\\omega_{\\rm d}/2\\pi =6.80120$, which is close to the expected value\n$(\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle}+\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle})/2$, but not\nequal because of the asymmetry of the line shape (<ref>).\nWe choose the amplitudes to produce $\\bar{n}_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}=50$\n(then $\\bar{n}_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle}=22$). The difference between\n$\\bar{n}_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}$ and $\\bar{n}_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle}$\nleads to different values $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|e\\rangle}=1.2$ and\n$\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|g\\rangle}=0.5$ when driving the readout\nresonator, while for driving the filter the field in the filter is\nsymmetric, $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|e\\rangle}=\\bar{n}_{\\rm\nf}^{|g\\rangle}=0.2$. Compared to the case of Fig.  (Figure: Phase-space transient evolution of qubit-state-dependent\ncoherent states in the filter resonator for driving either the\nreadout resonator (red curves, left) or the filter (blue curves, right), with the\ndrive amplitudes related via Eq. (<ref>)(a),\nthere is 5 times less power to be amplified for the $|e\\rangle$\nstate (when driving the filter); however, the state separation is\n1.3  times smaller (in amplitude) for the same $\\bar{n}_{\\rm\nr}^{|e\\rangle}$. Thus, there is a trade-off between the state\nseparation and amplified power in choosing the drive frequency.\nComparing the red and blue curves in Fig. (Figure: Phase-space transient evolution of qubit-state-dependent\ncoherent states in the filter resonator for driving either the\nreadout resonator (red curves, left) or the filter (blue curves, right), with the\ndrive amplitudes related via Eq. (<ref>)(b), we see that in the steady state $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|g\\rangle}$ and  $\\bar{n}_{\\rm f}^{|e\\rangle}$  are smaller for driving the\nfilter rather than the readout resonator. This is beneficial because\nthere is less power to be amplified; however, the ratio is not very big (as\nexpected for a moderate value $|\\chi|/\\kappa_{\\rm r}=0.28$).\n\nNote that our definition of $\\kappa_{\\rm r}$ in Eq.(<ref>) is not strictly well-defined because the resonator\nfrequency $\\omega_{\\rm r}$ depends on the qubit state, and the\ndrive frequency can be in between $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm |e\\rangle}$\nand $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm |g\\rangle}$. However, this frequency\ndifference is much smaller than $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$, and therefore not\nimportant for practical purposes in the definition of $\\kappa_{\\rm\nr}$. In an experiment $\\kappa_{\\rm r}$ can be measured either via the field decay\n[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] or via the linewidth of the steady-state transfer\nfunction showing the dip of $|\\gamma_{\\rm tl}^{\\rm (f)}/\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}|$ near the resonance $\\omega_{\\rm d}=\\omega_{\\rm r}$  [Eq. (<ref>)], since near the dip $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}\\approx \\kappa_{\\rm r}$.\n\nThus far we assumed that all decay $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ in the filter\nresonator is due to the leakage $\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{\\rm out}$ into the\noutgoing transmission line. If $\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{\\rm out} <\n\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ and the decay $\\kappa_{\\rm f}-\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{\\rm\nout}$ is due to leakage into the line delivering the drive\n$\\varepsilon_{\\rm f}$ or due to another dissipation channel, then\nthe only difference compared to the previous discussion is the extra\nfactor $\\sqrt{\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{\\rm out}/\\kappa_{\\rm f}}$ for the\noutgoing field $\\gamma_{\\rm tl}$. This will lead to multiplication\nof the overall quantum efficiency of the measurement by $\\kappa_{\\rm\nf}^{\\rm out}/\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ and will only slightly affect the\nmeasurement fidelity.  Adding dissipation in the readout resonator with\nrate $\\kappa_{\\rm r,d}$ increases the effective linewidth to\n$\\kappa_{\\rm eff}+\\kappa_{\\rm r,d}$ and multiplies the quantum\nefficiency by $\\kappa_{\\rm r}/(\\kappa_{\\rm r}+\\kappa_{\\rm r,d})$.\nMost importantly, since $\\kappa_{\\rm r,d}$ does not change with\nfrequency, the Purcell suppression factor (<ref>) becomes\n$(\\kappa_{\\rm q}+\\kappa_{\\rm r,d})/(\\kappa_{\\rm r}+\\kappa_{\\rm\nr,d})$, so that the Purcell filter performance deteriorates; we will\ndiscuss this in a little more detail in Sec. III$\\,$C.\n\nNote that our main result (<ref>) for the Purcell suppression\nfactor is slightly different from the result $F=[\\kappa_{\\rm\nf}/2(\\omega_{\\rm q}-\\omega_{\\rm r})]^2 (\\omega_{\\rm q}/\\omega_{\\rm\nr})^2$, which was derived in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] using the\ncircuit theory. The reasons are the following. First, in the\nderivation of [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] it was assumed that the two\nresonators have the same frequency, which makes the numerator in\nEq. (<ref>) equal to 1. Second, the term 1 in the denominator\nin Eq. (<ref>) was essentially neglected in comparison with the\nlarger second term. Finally, the role of the factor $(\\omega_{\\rm\nq}/\\omega_{\\rm r})^2$ is not quite clear. In the derivation of Ref.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] keeping this factor was exceeding the accuracy of\nthe derivation, while in our derivation we essentially use the\nrotating wave approximation, which assumes $\\omega_{\\rm\nq}/\\omega_{\\rm r}\\approx 1$. Aside from these small differences, our\nresult coincides with the result of Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n## Quantum analysis in single-excitation subspace\nIn this section we discuss the quantum derivation of the Purcell rate in the presence of the\nbandpass filter in the regime when the resonators are not driven or\ndriven sufficiently weakly to neglect dependence of the Purcell rate\non the number of photons in the resonator [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. More\nprecisely, we consider the quantum evolution in the\nsingle-excitation (and zero-excitation) subspace. We apply two\nmethods: the wavefunction approach, in which we use a non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian with a decaying wavefunction, and the more traditional\ndensity matrix analysis.\n\nIn the absence of the drive and in the rotating wave approximation, the relevant Hamiltonian of the system\nshown in Fig. (Figure: Qubit measurement schematic with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter  of Ref. <cit.>) (without considering decay $\\kappa_{\\rm\nf}$) is ($\\hbar =1$)\n$$\n\n&& H =  \\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b} \\sigma_+\\sigma_- + \\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b} a^\\dagger a + \\omega_{\\rm f} b^\\dagger b + g (a^\\dagger \\sigma_- + a\\sigma_+)\n\\nonumber \\\\\n&& \\hspace{0.8cm} +\\mathcal{G} a^\\dagger b + \\mathcal{G}^* a b^\\dagger ,\n\\label{Ham-start}\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}$ is the bare qubit frequency, $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}$ is the bare frequency of the readout\nresonator, $\\omega_{\\rm f}$ is the  filter resonator frequency,\nraising/lowering operators $\\sigma_{+}$ and $\\sigma_-$ act on the\nqubit state, $a^\\dagger$ and $a$ are the creation and annihilation\noperators for the readout resonator, $b^\\dagger$ and $b$ are for the\nfilter resonator, $g$ is the qubit-readout resonator coupling, and\n$\\mathcal{G}$ is the resonator-resonator coupling. For simplicity we\nassume a real positive $g$, but $\\mathcal{G}$ can be complex for generality (for the capacitive or inductive coupling between the resonators, $\\mathcal{G}$ is real if the same generalized coordinates are used for both resonators).\n\nNote that in the case without drive it is sufficient to consider only two\nlevels for the qubit because only the single-excitation (and\nzero-excitation) subspace is involved in the evolution, and therefore the amount of qubit nonlinearity due to the Josephson junction is irrelevant. However, in the presence of a drive (considered in the next section) it is formally necessary to take into account several levels in the qubit (as done in the Appendix). Nevertheless, to leading order the Purcell rate is insensitive to this, because the Purcell decay is essentially a classical linear effect (see discussion in the Appendix). Also note that the lab-frame Hamiltonian (<ref>) assumes the rotating wave approximation (as in the standard Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian), since it neglects the \u201ccounter-rotating\u201d terms of the form $a^\\dagger \\sigma_+$, $a\\sigma_-$, $a^\\dagger b^\\dagger$, and $ab$. This requires assumption that $|\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}|$, $|\\omega_{\\rm f}-\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}|$, $g$, and $|\\mathcal{G}|$ are small compared to $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}$.\n\nLet us choose the rotating frame with frequency $\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}$, i.e., $H_0=\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b} (\\sigma_+\\sigma_- + a^\\dagger a+b^\\dagger b)$; then the interaction Hamiltonian $V=H-H_0$ is\n$$\n\\label{h}\nV=\\Delta_{\\rm rq} a^\\dagger a + \\Delta_{\\rm fq} b^{\\dag}b\n+\\textit{g}(a^{\\dag}\\sigma_{-}+a\\sigma_{+})+\\mathcal{G}a^{\\dag}b+ \\mathcal{G}^* ab^{\\dag},\n\n$$\nwhere\n\u0394_rq=\u03c9_r^b-\u03c9_q^b,\n\u0394_fq=\u03c9_f-\u03c9_q^b,\nand the interaction picture is equivalent to the Schr\u00f6dinger picture because $\\exp(iH_0 t) V\\exp(-iH_0 t)=V$, which is because the starting Hamiltonian (<ref>) already assumes the rotating-wave approximation.\nThe master\nequation for the density matrix $\\rho$, which includes the damping $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ of the filter resonator is\n$$\n\\label{ma}\n\\dot \\rho=-i[V,\\rho]+\\kappa_{\\rm f} \\left(b\\rho b^{\\dag}-b^{\\dag}b\\rho/2-\\rho b^{\\dag}b/2\\right) .\n\n$$\n\nIn general, the bare basis is $|jnm\\rangle$, where $j$ represents the qubit states, while $n$ and $m$ represent the readout and filter resonator Fock states,\nrespectively. However, in this section we consider only the single-excitation (and zero-excitation) subspace, so only four bare states are relevant: $|\\textbf{e}\\rangle \\equiv |\\text{e}00\\rangle$, $|\\textbf{r}\\rangle=|\\text{g}10\\rangle$, $|\\textbf{f}\\rangle =|\\text{g}01\\rangle$, and $|\\textbf{g}\\rangle=|\\text{g}00\\rangle$.\n\nNote that the interaction hybridizes the bare states of the qubit and the resonators. (Hybridization of the readout resonator mode is essentially what makes the qubit measurement possible.) Therefore, when discussing the Purcell rate for the qubit energy relaxation, we actually mean decay of the eigenstate, corresponding to the qubit  excited state. This makes perfect sense experimentally, since manipulations of the qubit state usually occur in the eigenbasis (adiabatically, compared with the qubit detuning from the resonator).\n\n### Method I: Decaying wavefunction\nInstead of using the traditional density matrix language for the\ndescription of the Purcell effect [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], it is easier\nto use the language of wavefunctions, even in the presence of the\ndecay $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Physically, the wave functions\ncan still be used because in the single-excitation subspace\nunraveling of the Lindblad equation corresponds to only one \u201cno\nrelaxation\u201d scenario (see, e.g., [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]), and therefore the\nwavefunction evolution is non-stochastic. Another, more formal way\nto introduce this language, is to rewrite the master equation\n(<ref>) as [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] $\\dot \\rho=-i[H_{\\rm\neff},\\rho]+\\kappa_{\\rm f} b\\rho b^{\\dag}$, where $H_{\\rm\neff}=V-i\\kappa_{\\rm f} b^{\\dag}b/2$ is an effective non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian. Next, the term $\\kappa_{\\rm f} b\\rho b^{\\dag}$ can be\nneglected because in the single-excitation subspace it produces only\nan \u201cincoming\u201d contribution  from higher-excitation subspaces,\nwhich are not populated. Therefore, in the single-excitation\nsubspace we can use $\\dot \\rho=-i[H_{\\rm eff},\\rho]$. Equivalently,\n$|\\dot \\psi \\rangle=-iH_{\\rm eff}|\\psi\\rangle$, which describes the\nevolution of the decaying wavefunction\n$|\\psi(t)\\rangle=c_{\\textbf e}(t)|\\textbf{e}\\rangle+c_{\\textbf\nr}(t)|\\textbf{r}\\rangle+c_{\\textbf f}(t)|\\textbf{f}\\rangle$.\nTherefore, the probability amplitudes\n$c_{\\textbf{e},\\textbf{r},\\textbf{f}}$ satisfy the following\nequations:\n$$\n\n% \\nonumber to remove numbering (before each equation)\n&& \\dot c_{\\textbf e} = -i g c_{\\textbf r},\n\\label{c-dot-e}\\\\\n&& \\dot c_{\\textbf r} = -i\\Delta_{\\rm rq}  c_{\\textbf r} -i gc_{\\textbf e} -i\\mathcal{G} c_{\\textbf f},\n\\label{c-dot-r}\\\\\n&& \\dot c_{\\textbf f} = -i \\Delta_{\\rm fq} c_{\\textbf f} -i\\mathcal{G}^*c_{\\textbf r} -(\\kappa_{\\rm f}/2)\\, c_{\\textbf f},\n\\label{c-dot-f}\n$$\nwhile the population $\\rho_{\\textbf{gg}}$ of the zero-excitation\nstate $|\\textbf{g}\\rangle$ evolves as\n$\\dot\\rho_{\\textbf{gg}}=\\kappa_{\\rm f}|c_{\\textbf{ff}}|^2$ or can be\nfound as $\\rho_{\\textbf{gg}}=1-|c_{\\textbf{ee}}|^2\n-|c_{\\textbf{rr}}|^2 -|c_{\\textbf{ff}}|^2$. Note that Eqs.(<ref>) and (<ref>) exactly correspond to the\nclassical equations (<ref>) and (<ref>) with\n$\\Delta_{\\rm rd}$ replaced with $\\Delta_{\\rm rq}$, also $\\Delta_{\\rm\nfd}$ replaced with $\\Delta_{\\rm fq}$, and $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$\nreplaced with $gc_{\\textbf e}$.\n\nFrom the eigenvalues $\\lambda_{\\textbf{e},\\textbf{r},\\textbf{f}}=-i\n\\omega_{\\textbf{e},\\textbf{r},\\textbf{f}}-\\Gamma_{\\textbf{e},\\textbf{r},\\textbf{f}}/2$\nof the matrix representing Eqs. (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>),\none can obtain the  eigenfrequencies\n$\\omega_{\\textbf{e},\\textbf{r},\\textbf{f}}$ and the corresponding\ndecay rates $\\Gamma_{\\textbf{e},\\textbf{r},\\textbf{f}}$. These\neigenvalues can be found from the qubic equation\n$$\n\\label{lambda-eq}\n& \\lambda ^3+ \\lambda^2 (i\\Delta_{\\rm rq} +i\\Delta_{\\rm fq} + \\kappa_{\\rm f}/2)\n+ \\lambda (- \\Delta_{\\rm rq}\\Delta_{\\rm fq} +|\\mathcal{G}|^2 +g^2\n\\notag\\\\\n& \\hspace{0.5cm} + i \\Delta_{\\rm rq} \\kappa_{\\rm f}/2) + g^2 (i \\Delta_{\\rm fq}+ \\kappa_{\\rm f}/2 ) =0 .\n\n$$\nWe are interested in the Purcell rate $\\Gamma=\\Gamma_{\\textbf e}$,\nwhich corresponds to the decay of the eigenstate close to\n$|\\textbf{e}\\rangle$. Since $\\lambda_{\\textbf{e}}$ is close to zero,\nin the first approximation we can neglect the term $\\lambda^3$ in\nEq. (<ref>), thus reducing it to the quadratic equation.\nIf more accuracy is needed, the equation can be solved iteratively,\nreplacing $\\lambda^3$ with the value found in the previous iteration\n(the second iteration is usually sufficient).\n\nBesides finding the Purcell rate $\\Gamma$ exactly or approximately\nfrom Eq. (<ref>), we can find it approximately by using\nquasisteady solutions of Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>),\nto a large extent  following the classical derivation in the\nprevious section. Assuming $\\dot c_{\\textbf f}=0$ in Eq.(<ref>), we find $c_{\\textbf f}=-i\\mathcal{G}^* c_{\\textbf\nr}/(i\\Delta_{\\rm fq}+\\kappa_{\\rm f}/2)$. Inserting this quasisteady\nvalue into Eq. (<ref>) and assuming $\\dot c_{\\textbf r}=0$,\nwe find $c_{\\textbf r}=-igc_{\\textbf e}/[i\\Delta_{\\rm rq} +\n|\\mathcal{G}|^2 /(i\\Delta_{\\rm fq}+\\kappa_{\\rm f}/2)]$. Substituting\nthis quasisteady value into Eq. (<ref>), we obtain\n\u010b_e=- g^2 /i\u0394_rq + |\ud835\udca2|^2 /(i\u0394_fq+\u03ba_f/2)   c_e = \u03bb_e c_e.\nFinally, we obtain the Purcell rate as $\\Gamma =-2{\\rm\nRe}(\\lambda_{\\textbf e})$,\n$$\n\n&& \\Gamma = \\frac{g^2 |\\mathcal{G}|^2\\kappa_{\\rm f}}\n{\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^2 [(\\Delta_{\\rm fq}-|\\mathcal G|^2/\\Delta_{\\rm rq})^2 +(\\kappa_{\\rm f}/2)^2]}\n\\label{Gamma-wf-1}\\\\\n&& \\hspace{0.3cm} \\approx \\frac{g^2 |\\mathcal{G}|^2\\kappa_{\\rm f}}\n{\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^2 [\\Delta_{\\rm fq}^2 +(\\kappa_{\\rm f}/2)^2]} = \\frac{g^2\\kappa_{\\rm q}}{\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^2},\n\\label{Gamma-wf}\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa_{\\rm q}$ is given by Eq. (<ref>) and we\nassumed  $|\\mathcal{G}|^2 \\ll  \\Delta_{\\rm fq}\\Delta_{\\rm rq}$ to transform Eq. (<ref>) into Eq. (<ref>).\n\nThe Purcell rate given by Eq. (<ref>) is exactly what we\nexpected from the classical analysis in Sec. II: in the usual\nformula (<ref>) we simply need to substitute $\\kappa$\nwith the readout resonator decay rate $\\kappa_{\\rm q}$ seen by the qubit.\nSince the measurement is governed by a different decay rate\n$\\kappa_{\\rm r}$, the effective Purcell rate suppression factor is\ngiven by Eq. (<ref>), as was expected. This confirms the\nresults of the classical analysis in Sec. II.\n\n### Method II: Density matrix analysis\nWe can also find the Purcell rate in a more traditional way by writing\nthe master equation (<ref>) explicitly in the single-excitation subspace:\n$$\n\n% \\nonumber to remove numbering (before each equation)\n&& \\dot \\rho_{\\textbf{ee}} = i\\textit{g}(\\rho_{\\textbf{er}}-\\rho_{\\textbf{re}}), \\label{r11} \\\\\n&& \\dot \\rho_{\\textbf{er}} = -i\\Delta_{\\rm qr} \\rho_{\\textbf{er}}-i\\textit{g}(\\rho_{\\textbf{rr}}-\\rho_{\\textbf{ee}})\n+i\\mathcal{G}^*\\rho_{\\textbf{ef}},\n\\label{r12} \\\\\n&& \\dot \\rho_{\\textbf{ef}} = -\\frac{\\kappa_{\\rm f}}{2}\\rho_{\\textbf{ef}}-i\\Delta_{\\rm qf}\\rho_{\\textbf{ef}}+i\\mathcal{G}\\rho_{\\textbf{er}} -ig \\rho_{\\textbf{rf}},\n\\label{r13} \\\\\n&& \\dot \\rho_{\\textbf{rr}} =-i\\textit{g}(\\rho_{\\textbf{er}}-\\rho_{\\textbf{re}})-i\\mathcal{G}\n\\rho_{\\textbf{fr}}+i\\mathcal{G}^*\\rho_{\\textbf{rf}},\n\\label{6}\\\\\n&& \\dot\\rho_{\\textbf{rf}}=-\\frac{\\kappa_{\\rm f}}{2}\\rho_{\\textbf{rf}}+i\\Delta_{\\rm fr}\\rho_{\\textbf{rf}}-i\\mathcal{G}\\rho_{\\textbf{ff}}+i \\mathcal{G}^* \\rho_{\\textbf{rr}}\n-ig \\rho_{\\textbf{ef}}, \\qquad \\label{7}\\\\\n&&  \\dot \\rho_{\\textbf{ff}} = -\\kappa_{\\rm f} \\rho_{\\textbf{ff}} -i\\mathcal{G}^*\\rho_{\\textbf{rf}}+i \\mathcal{G}\\rho_{\\textbf{fr}}.\n\\label{8}\n\n$$\nNote that $\\dot \\rho_{\\textbf{gg}} = \\kappa_{\\rm f}\n\\rho_{\\textbf{ff}}$ and\n$\\rho_{\\textbf{ee}}+\\rho_{\\textbf{rr}}+\\rho_{\\textbf{ff}}+\\rho_{\\textbf{gg}}=1$ (however, we do not use these two equations for the derivation of the\nPurcell rate).\n\nUsing the quasisteady solutions of Eqs. (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>),\ni.e. assuming $\\dot \\rho_{\\textbf{er}}=\\dot \\rho_{\\textbf{ef}}=\\dot\n\\rho_{\\textbf{rr}}=\\dot \\rho_{\\textbf{rf}}=\\dot\n\\rho_{\\textbf{ff}}=0$, we can obtain a lengthy equation for\n$\\rho_{\\textbf{er}}$, which is proportional to $\\rho_{\\textbf{ee}}$.\nIf we use the first-order expansion of this equation in the coupling\n$g$ and neglect $g^3$ terms (there is no $g^2$ contribution), then\n\u03c1_er = ig/i\u0394_rq+|\ud835\udca2|^2/(i\u0394_fq+\u03ba_f/2)   \u03c1_ee,\nwhich has the form similar to Eq. (<ref>). Substituting\nthis $\\rho_{\\textbf{er}}$ into Eq. (<ref>), we obtain the\nevolution equation $\\dot\\rho_{\\textbf{ee}}=-\\Gamma\n\\rho_{\\textbf{ee}}$ with $\\Gamma$ given exactly by Eq.(<ref>). If we do not use the above-mentioned\napproximation for the quasisteady $\\rho_{\\textbf{er}}$, then the\nresult for the Purcell rate is slightly different and much\nlengthier,\n$$\n\n&&    \\Gamma = g^2 |\\mathcal{G}|^2\\kappa_{\\rm f}  \\big[\n(\\Delta_{\\rm rq} \\Delta_{\\rm fq} -|\\mathcal G|^2)^2\n+ (\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^2 +g^2)(\\kappa_{\\rm f}/2)^2\n\\nonumber \\\\\n&& \\hspace{0.5cm}\n+g^2 (\\Delta_{\\rm fq}^2 +2\\Delta_{\\rm fq}\\Delta_{\\rm rq}\n- |\\mathcal G|^2 ) + g^4 \\big]^{-1} .\n\\label{Gamma-dm}\n$$\nThus the derivations based on the wavefunction and density matrix\nlanguages using the quasisteady-state approximation both lead to practically\nthe same result for the Purcell rate $\\Gamma$. The most physically\ntransparent result is given by Eq. (<ref>), which\ncorresponds to the semiclassical analysis in Sec. II and simply\nreplaces $\\kappa$ in Eq. (<ref>) with $\\kappa_{\\rm q}$\nseen by the qubit, in contrast to the measurement process, which is\ngoverned by $\\kappa_{\\rm r}$.\n\nAs an example, let us use the parameters similar to that in\nRef. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]: $\\omega_{\\rm q}/2\\pi = 5.9$ GHz,\n$\\omega_{\\rm r}/2\\pi = 6.8$ GHz, $\\omega_{\\rm f}/2\\pi = 6.75$ GHz,\n$Q_{\\rm f}=30$ (so that $\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{-1}= 0.71$ ns), $g/2\\pi=90$\nMHz, and $\\kappa_{\\rm r}^{-1}=30$ ns (so that $\\mathcal{G}/2\\pi\n=18.9$ MHz). In this case the resonator decay [Eq. (<ref>)]\nseen by the qubit is $\\kappa_{\\rm q}^{-1}=1.45\\, \\mu$s, the Purcell\nrate [Eq. (<ref>)] is $\\Gamma =1/(145\\, \\mu{\\rm s})$, and\nthe Purcell rate suppression factor [Eq. (<ref>)] is\n$F=30\\,{\\rm ns}/1.45\\, \\mu{\\rm s}=(1+0.44^2)/(1+7.6^2)=0.021$.\n\nThus, for typical parameters the bandpass Purcell filter suppresses\nthe Purcell decay by a factor of $\\sim$50. It is easy to increase\nthis factor to 100 by using $\\omega_{\\rm q}/2\\pi = 5.5$ GHz in the\nabove example; however, further decrease of the Purcell rate is not\nneeded for practical purposes, while increased resonator-qubit\ndetuning decreases the dispersive shift $2\\chi$ (in the above\nexample $2\\chi/2\\pi \\approx -3$ MHz for the qubit anharmonicity of\n180 MHz, while for $\\omega_{\\rm q}/2\\pi = 5.5$ GHz the dispersive\nshift becomes twice less).\n\nNote that for the parameters in the above example, Eq.(<ref>) overestimates the exact solution for $\\Gamma$ via\nEq. (<ref>) by 5\n(<ref>), and Eq. (<ref>) overestimates the\nPurcell rate by 2\nquadratic equation neglecting $\\lambda^3$ gives $\\Gamma$, which\noverestimates the exact solution by 22\nis practically exact ($-0.01\\%$). The inaccuracies grow for smaller\nresonator-qubit detuning (crudely as $\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^{-2}$), but\nremain reasonably small in a sufficiently wide range; for example,\nEq. (<ref>) overestimates the Purcell rate by $50\\%$ for\n$\\omega_{\\rm q}/2\\pi=6.5$ GHz, i.e. detuning of 0.3 GHz.\n\n### Nonzero readout resonator damping\nIn the quantum evolution model (<ref>) we have considered only\nthe damping of the filter resonator with the rate $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$.\nIf there is also an additional energy dissipation in the readout\nresonator with the rate $\\kappa_{\\rm r,d}$ (e.g., due to coupling\nwith the transmission line delivering the drive $\\varepsilon_{\\rm\nr}$ in Fig. (Figure: Qubit measurement schematic with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter  of Ref. <cit.>)), then the master equation (<ref>) should\nbe replaced with\n$$\n\\label{maN}\n\\dot \\rho=&-i[V,\\rho]+\\kappa_{\\rm f} \\left(b\\rho b^{\\dag}-b^{\\dag}b\\rho/2-\\rho b^{\\dag}b/2\\right)\\notag\\\\\n&+\\kappa_{\\rm r,d}(a\\rho a^{\\dag}-a^{\\dag}a\\rho/2-\\rho a^{\\dag}a/2).\n\n$$\nIn the wavefunction-language derivation this leads to the extra term\n$-\\kappa_{\\rm r,d}c_{\\textbf r}/2$ in Eq. (<ref>) for $\\dot\nc_{\\textbf r}$. This does not change the quasisteady value for\n$c_{\\textbf f}$ but changes the quasisteady value $c_{\\textbf\nr}=-igc_{\\textbf e}/[i\\Delta_{\\rm rq} + |\\mathcal{G}|^2\n/(i\\Delta_{\\rm fq}+\\kappa_{\\rm f}/2)+\\kappa_{\\rm r,d}/2]$, so that\nthe Purcell rate is\n$$\n\n&&    \\Gamma =2 \\, {\\rm Re} \\left[ \\frac{ g^2 } {i\\Delta_{\\rm rq} +\n|\\mathcal{G}|^2 /(i\\Delta_{\\rm fq}+\\kappa_{\\rm f}/2) +\\kappa_{\\rm\nr,d}/2} \\right] \\qquad\n\\\\\n&& \\hspace{0.5cm} \\approx \\frac{g^2(\\kappa_{\\rm q}\n+\\kappa_{\\rm r,d})}{\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^2}\n\n$$\ninstead of Eq. (<ref>). Practically the same result can be obtained\nusing the derivation via the density matrix evolution (assuming $\\kappa_{\\rm r, d}\\ll \\kappa_{\\rm f}$). As expected,\nthe dissipation $\\kappa_{\\rm r,d}$ simply adds to the rate\n$\\kappa_{\\rm q}$ seen by the qubit. Since $\\kappa_{\\rm r,d}$ is not\naffected by the filter, it adds in the same way to the bandwidth\n$\\kappa_{\\rm r}$ governing the qubit measurement process and thus\ndeteriorates the Purcell rate suppression (<ref>), replacing it\nwith $F=(\\kappa_{\\rm q}+\\kappa_{\\rm r,d})/(\\kappa_{\\rm r}\n+\\kappa_{\\rm r,d})$.\n\n## Purcell rate with microwave drive and bandpass filter\nThe Purcell rate may decrease when the measurement microwave drive is added [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. A simple physical reason is the ac Stark shift, which in the typical setup increases the absolute value of detuning between the qubit and readout resonator with increasing number of photons in the resonator, thus reducing the Purcell rate. However, this explanation may not necessarily work well quantitatively.\n\nThe Purcell rate suppression due to the microwave drive was analyzed\nin Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for the case without the Purcell filter and\nusing the two-level approximation for the qubit. It was shown that\nin this case the suppression factor $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})/\\Gamma (0)$ is\napproximately $[(1+\\bar{n}/n_{\\rm crit})^{-1/2}+(1+\\bar{n}/n_{\\rm\ncrit})^{-1}]^2$ instead of the factor $(1+\\bar{n}/n_{\\rm\ncrit})^{-1}$ expected from the ac Stark shift, where $\\bar{n}$ is\nthe mean number of photons in the resonator and $n_{\\rm crit}\\equiv\n(\\Delta_{\\rm rq}/2g)^2$. This difference results in the ratio $3/2$\nbetween the corresponding slopes of $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})$ at small\n$\\bar{n}$, with the ac Stark shift model underestimating the Purcell\nrate suppression (see the blue lines in Fig. (Figure: Purcell relaxation time versus qubit-resonator detuning  for g/2\u03c0=86MHz)). However, when the third level of the qubit is taken into account, then the ac Stark shift model describes correctly the slope of $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})$ at small $\\bar{n}$  when the qubit anharmonicity is relatively small, $|\\delta_{\\rm q}/\\Delta_{\\rm rq}| \\ll 1$ (see Appendix). In this case the ac Stark shift model predicts $\\Gamma\n(\\bar{n})/\\Gamma (0)=1+4 \\bar{n}\\chi (0) /\\Delta_{\\rm rq}$ at\n$\\bar{n}\\ll n_{\\rm crit}$, where $\\chi (0)$ is the value of $\\chi$ at $\\bar{n}=0$; note that $|\\chi (0)| \\ll |g^2/\\Delta_{\\rm rq}|$ and $\\chi (0) <0$ when\n$\\Delta_{\\rm rq}> 0$.\n\nWith the filter resonator, we also expect that the ac Stark shift\nmodel for the Purcell rate suppression should work reasonably well,\nso that from Eq. (<ref>) we expect\n\u0393(n\u0305) \u2248g^2 |\ud835\udca2|^2\u03ba_f/[\u03c9_r-\u03c9_q,eff (n\u0305)]^2\n{[\u03c9_f-\u03c9_q,eff (n\u0305)]^2 +(\u03ba_f/2)^2} ,\nwhere $\\omega_{\\rm q,eff} (\\bar{n})$ is the effective qubit frequency, $\\omega_{\\rm q,eff} (\\bar{n})=\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}+2\\chi (0) \\bar{n}$ if\nwe neglect dependence of $\\chi$ on $\\bar{n}$ and the \u201cLamb shift\u201d.\nTherefore, in a typical situation when $|\\omega_{\\rm f} - \\omega_{\\rm r}| \\ll |\\omega_{\\rm r} - \\omega_{\\rm q}|$ and $\\kappa_{\\rm f} \\ll |\\omega_{\\rm r} - \\omega_{\\rm q}|$, we expect the suppression ratio\n\u0393(n\u0305)/\u0393(0) \u2248[\u03c9_r-\u03c9_q^b/\u03c9_r-\u03c9_q,eff (n\u0305) ]^4 .\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nThe Purcell relaxation rate $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})$ with a microwave drive,\nnormalized by the no-drive rate $\\Gamma(0)$, with the filter (red solid curve) and without the filter (blue solid curve), as functions of the mean number of photons $\\bar n$ in the readout resonator. The numerical simulations used the two-level approximation for the qubit, for which $\\bar{n}/|\\Delta_{\\rm rq}/\\chi (0)|=\\bar{n}/4n_{\\rm crit}$. The dashed lines show the values expected from the model based on the ac Stark shift: $\\Gamma ({\\bar n})/\\Gamma (0)=(1+{\\bar n}/n_{\\rm crit})^{-2}$ with the filter and $(1+{\\bar n}/n_{\\rm crit})^{-1}$ without the filter. The parameters used in the simulations are given in the text.\n\nTo check the accuracy of this formula numerically, we need to add into the Hamiltonian (<ref>) the terms describing the drive and higher levels in the qubit (see Appendix). However, the resulting Hilbert space was too large for our numerical simulations, so we numerically calculated $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})$ using only the two-level approximation for the qubit. Using the rotating frame based on the drive frequency $\\omega_{\\rm d}$ [i.e., $H_0=\\omega_{\\rm d}(\\sigma_+\\sigma_- +a^\\dagger a+ b^\\dagger b)$], we then obtain the interaction Hamiltonian\n$$\n\\label{h}\nV_{\\rm d}&=\\Delta_{\\rm rd}a^{\\dag}a+\\Delta_{\\rm fd}b^{\\dag}b+ \\Delta_{\\rm qd} \\sigma_+\\sigma_- +\\textit{g}(a^{\\dag}\\sigma_{-}+a\\sigma_{+})\\notag\\\\\n&+\\mathcal{G}a^{\\dag}b+ \\mathcal{G}^*ab^{\\dag} +\\varepsilon_{\\rm r} a^{\\dag}\n+ \\varepsilon_{\\rm r}^* a,\n\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_{\\rm rd}=\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}-\\omega_{\\rm d}$,  $\\Delta_{\\rm fd}=\\omega_{\\rm f}-\\omega_{\\rm d}$, $\\Delta_{\\rm qd}=\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-\\omega_{\\rm d}$, and for simplicity we assumed that the drive $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$\nis applied to the readout resonator. (For the rotating wave approximation we also need to assume that $|\\Delta_{\\rm rd}|$, $|\\Delta_{\\rm fd}|$, $|\\Delta_{\\rm qd}|$, $|g|$, $|\\mathcal{G}|$, and $|\\dot{\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}}/\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}|$ are all small compared with $\\omega_{\\rm d}$.) Note that in the two-level\napproximation $[\\omega_{\\rm r}-\\omega_{\\rm q,eff} (\\bar{n}) ]^2\n=\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^2+4g^2\\bar{n}=\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^2 (1+\\bar{n}/n_{\\rm\ncrit})$.\n\nWe have numerically solved the full master equation with the\nHamiltonian (<ref>), including the decay $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ of the\nfilter resonator. As the initial state we use the excited state for\nthe qubit and vacuum for the two resonators, $|\\psi\\rangle_{\\rm\nin}=|e00\\rangle$. The Purcell rate is extracted from the numerical\nsolution of $\\rho_{ee}(t)$ by fitting $-\\ln[\\rho_{ee}(t)]$ with a\nlinear function in the long time limit (still requiring $1-\\rho_{ee}(t)\\ll 1$). In the simulations we pump\nthe readout resonator with the frequency $\\omega_{\\rm d}=\\omega_{\\rm\nr}^{|e\\rangle}$ and control $\\bar{n}$ by\nchoosing the corresponding value of $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$. The value of $\\bar{n}$ is calculated numerically; it is close to what is expected from the solution of the classical field equations when the $n$-dependence of $\\chi$ and $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}$ is taken into account: in the two-level approximation $\\chi({\\bar n})=-g^2/[\\Delta_{\\rm rq}\\sqrt{1+4g^2{\\bar n}/\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^2}]$ and $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}=\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}+\\chi ({\\bar n})$. Since $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}$ changes with $\\bar n$, we change $\\omega_{\\rm d}$ accordingly.\n\nThe red solid line in Fig.  (Figure: Purcell relaxation time versus qubit-resonator detuning  for g/2\u03c0=86MHz) shows the numerical results for the Purcell rate suppression factor $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})/\\Gamma (0)$ as a function of $\\bar n=\\bar{n}^{|e\\rangle}$, normalized by $|\\Delta_{\\rm rq}/\\chi(0)|$. Note that in the two-level approximation (which we used in the simulations) ${\\bar n}/|\\Delta_{\\rm rq}/\\chi(0)|={\\bar n}/4n_{\\rm crit}$. In the simulations we have used $g/2\\pi=100\\,$MHz, $\\kappa_{\\rm r}^{-1}=36\\,$ns, $\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{-1}=0.71\\,$ns, $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}/2\\pi=\\omega_{\\rm f}/2\\pi=6.8\\,$GHz,\nand $\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}/2\\pi=6\\,$GHz. The blue solid line shows the numerical suppression factor for the standard setup [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (without the filter resonator), also in the two-level approximation for the qubit. We see a larger suppression for the case with the filter, as expected from\nthe ac Stark shift interpretation and the fact that $\\Gamma \\propto \\Delta_{\\rm rq}^{-4}$ with the filter, while $\\Gamma \\propto \\Delta_{\\rm rq}^{-2}$ in the standard setup.\nHowever, comparison with the prediction of the ac Stark shift model (dashed lines) does not show a quantitative agreement. There is about 10\n\nNote that the numerical calculations have been made using only the two-level model for the qubit. It is possible that the agreement between the ac Stark shift model and the numerical results is much better if three or more levels in the qubit are taken into account. This is an interesting question for further research.\n\nAlso note that in experiments, increase of the drive power often leads to decrease of the qubit lifetime, instead of the increase, predicted by our analysis (both with and without the filter). The reason for this effect is not quite clear and may be related to various technical issues. Therefore, either suppression or enhancement of the qubit relaxation with the drive power may be observed in actual experiments.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn this paper we have discussed the theory of the bandpass Purcell filter used in Refs. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for measurement of superconducting qubits. An additional wide-bandwidth filter resonator (Fig. (Figure: Qubit measurement schematic with the bandpass Purcell\nfilter  of Ref. <cit.>)) coupled to the readout resonator easily passes the microwave field used for the qubit measurement, but strongly impedes the propagation of a photon at the qubit frequency, which is far outside of the filter bandwidth. A simple way to quantitatively describe the operation of the filter is by noticing that the effective decay rate $\\kappa_{\\rm eff}$ of the readout resonator [Eq. (<ref>)] depends on frequency. Therefore, the measurement is governed by a relatively large value $\\kappa_{\\rm r}$ [Eq. (<ref>)], which permits a fast measurement, while the Purcell relaxation is determined by a much smaller value $\\kappa_{\\rm q}$ seen by the qubit [Eq. (<ref>)]. The ratio of these effective decay rates of the readout resonator gives the suppression factor for the qubit relaxation [Eq. (<ref>)]. The result for the suppression factor is similar to the result obtained in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] using circuit theory (with a few minor differences).\n\nWe have first analyzed the operation of the Purcell filter quasiclassically, and then confirmed the results using the quantum approach. In the quantum analysis we have used two approaches: based on decaying wavefunction and density matrix evolutions. While the Purcell effect is traditionally described using density matrices, it is actually simpler to use the approach based on wavefunctions. The results of our semiclassical and two quantum approaches are very close to each other; however, they are not identical because the approaches use slightly different approximations. A simple and most physically transparent result for the Purcell rate is given by Eq. (<ref>).\n\nThe Purcell rate of the qubit decay is further suppressed when a microwave drive is applied for measurement. The effect is similar to what was discussed in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for the standard setup without the filter, and can be crudely understood as being due to the ac Stark shift of the qubit frequency, which increases the resonator-qubit detuning $\\Delta_{\\rm rq}$. Since the Purcell rate with the filter scales with $\\Delta_{\\rm rq}$ crudely as $\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^{-4}$   [Eq. (<ref>)] instead of $\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^{-2}$ in the standard setup, the Purcell rate suppression due to microwaves is stronger in the case with the filter. Numerical results for the suppression due to microwaves using the two-level approximation for the qubit show that the explanation based on ac Stark shift works well, but underestimates the effect by about 10\n\nThe bandpass Purcell filter decreases the qubit decay due to the Purcell effect by a factor of $\\sim$50 for typical parameters, for the same measurement conditions as in the standard setup without the filter. This allows much faster and more accurate measurement of superconducting qubits, compared to the case without the filter.

In the standard setup\n[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (Fig. (Figure: Schematic of a standard circuit QED qubit readout setup. The qubit state slightly changes the resonator frequency \u03c9_ r)) the qubit is\ndispersively coupled with the resonator, so that the qubit state\nslightly changes the resonator frequency. This change causes a phase\nshift (and in general an amplitude change) of a microwave field\ntransmitted through or reflected from the resonator. The transmitted\nor reflected microwave is then amplified and sent to a mixer, so\nthat the phase shift (and amplitude change) can be discriminated,\nthus distinguishing the states $|g\\rangle$ and $|e\\rangle$ of the\nqubit.\n\n### Basic theory\nFor the basic analysis of measurement [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], it is\nsufficient to consider three energy levels of the qubit: the ground\nstate $|g\\rangle$, the first excited state $|e\\rangle$, and the\nsecond excited state $|f\\rangle$, so that the Hamiltonian is\n($\\hbar=1$)\n$$\n\nH & =  \\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b} |e\\rangle \\langle e| +\n(2\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-\\delta_{\\rm q}) |f\\rangle \\langle f| +\n\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b} a^{\\dag}a\n\\nonumber \\\\\n& + g a^{\\dag}|g\\rangle\\langle e| +g^* a |g\\rangle\\langle e|\n+ \\tilde{g} a^{\\dag}|e\\rangle\\langle f| +\n\\tilde{g}^* a |f\\rangle\\langle e|\n\\notag\\\\\n&+\\varepsilon_{\\rm r} a^\\dagger e^{-i\\omega_{\\rm d}t}+\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}^*\na e^{i\\omega_{\\rm d}t}+H_{\\kappa}+H_{\\gamma},\n\\label{H-standadr-init}\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}$ is the bare qubit frequency,\n$\\delta_{\\rm q}$ is its ahnarmononicity ($\\delta_{\\rm q}>0$,\n$\\delta_{\\rm q}/ \\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b} \\sim 0.2\\, {\\rm GHz}/6\\,\n{\\rm GHz}\\ll 1$), $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}$ is the bare resonator\nfrequency, $a$ is the annihilation operator for the resonator, $g$\nis the coupling between the qubit and the resonator,\n$\\tilde{g}\\approx \\sqrt{2}\\,g$ is the similar coupling involving\nlevels $|e\\rangle$ and $|f\\rangle$, and $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$ is the\nnormalized amplitude of the microwave drive with frequency\n$\\omega_{\\rm d}$. For brevity $H_{\\kappa}$ describes the coupling of\nthe resonator with the transmission line, which causes resonator\nenergy damping with the rate $\\kappa$, while $H_\\gamma$ describes\nthe intrinsic qubit relaxation (excluding the Purcell effect) with\nthe rate $T_{1,\\rm int}^{-1}$. Note that in the Hamiltonian\n(<ref>) we neglected the coupling terms creating or\nannihilating the double excitations in the qubit and the resonator.\nFor simplicity we assume a real coupling: $g^*=g$ and\n$\\tilde{g}^*=\\tilde{g}$.\n\nFor a simple analysis of the measurement process, let us first\nneglect $H_\\kappa$, $H_\\gamma$, and the drive $\\varepsilon_r$, and\nconsider the three Jaynes-Cummings ladders of states\n$|g,n\\rangle$, $|e,n\\rangle$, and $|f,n\\rangle$, where $n$ denotes\nthe number of photons in the resonator. The coupling $g$ provides\nthe level repulsion between $|g,n+1\\rangle$ and $|e,n\\rangle$\n(effective coupling is $\\sqrt{n+1}\\, g$), while $\\tilde{g}$ provides\nthe level repulsion between $|e,n+1\\rangle$ and $|f,n\\rangle$ (with\ncoupling $\\sqrt{n+1}\\, \\tilde{g}$). Assuming sufficiently large level\nseparation, $|\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b} |\\gg\n\\sqrt{n} \\, |g|$ and $|\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-\\delta_{\\rm q}\n-\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}| \\gg \\sqrt{n} \\, |\\tilde{g}|$, we can treat\nthe level repulsion to lowest order; then the energies of the\neigenstates $\\overline{|g,n\\rangle}$ and $\\overline{|e,n\\rangle}$\nare\n$$\n\n&    E_{\\overline{|g,n\\rangle}}= n\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b} -  \\,\n\\frac{n g^2}{\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}},\n\\label{eigenenergy-g}\\\\\n& E_{\\overline{|e,n\\rangle}}=\n\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b }+ n\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b} + \\, \\frac{(n+1)\\,\ng^2}{\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}} -\n\\frac{n\\tilde{g}^2}{\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b} -\\delta_{\\rm\nq}-\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}}.\n\\label{eigenenergy-e}\n$$\nTherefore the effective resonator frequency $\\omega_{\\rm\nr}^{|g\\rangle}$ when the qubit in the ground state is\n\u03c9_r^|g\u27e9 = E_|g,n+1\u27e9 - E_|g,n\u27e9\n= \u03c9_r^b - g^2/\u0394,\nwhere\n\u0394=\u0394_qr=\u03c9_q^b-\u03c9_r^b,\nwhile for the qubit state $|e\\rangle$ the effective resonator\nfrequency is\n\u03c9_r^|e\u27e9 = E_|e,n+1\u27e9   -\nE_|e,n\u27e9\n= \u03c9_r^b + g^2/\u0394 -\ng\u0303^2/\u0394- \u03b4_q.\nDenoting the frequency difference by $2\\chi$, we obtain\n$$\n\n&& \\hspace{2cm}  \\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}-  \\omega_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle} = 2\\chi,\n\\,\\,\\,\n\\label{chi-def}\\\\\n&&  \\chi = \\frac{g^2}{\\Delta} -\n\\frac{\\tilde{g}^2/2}{\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q}} =-\\frac{g^2\\delta_{\\rm q}}{\\Delta (\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q})} + \\frac{g^2-\\tilde{g}^2/2}{\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q}}. \\qquad\n\\label{chi-res}\n$$\nThe corresponding effective qubit frequency is\n\u03c9_q^eff  = E_|e,n\u27e9 -\nE_|g,n\u27e9\n= \u03c9_q^b\n+   g^2/\u0394 +2n\u03c7,\nwhich includes the \u201cLamb shift\u201d $g^2/\\Delta$ and the \u201cac Stark\nshift\u201d $2n\\chi$.\n\nTherefore, in this case the first two lines of the Hamiltonian\n(<ref>) can be approximated as\nH = \u03c9_q/2   \u03c3_z + \u03c9_r a^\u2020a +\n\u03c7a^\u2020a   \u03c3_z,\nwhere\n\u03c9_q=\u03c9_q^b+g^2/\u0394,\n\u03c9_r= \u03c9_r^b- 1/2\ng\u0303^2/\u0394- \u03b4_q,\n$\\sigma_z=|e\\rangle\\langle e|-|g\\rangle\\langle g|$, we shifted the\nenergy by $-\\omega_{\\rm q}/2$, and we no longer need the qubit state\n$|f\\rangle$.\n\nNote that the dispersive coupling $\\chi$ given by Eq.(<ref>) is much smaller [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] than the value\n$g^2/\\Delta$ expected in the two-level case. This is because the\ntransmon and Xmon qubits are only slightly different from a linear\noscillator, for which $\\tilde{g}=\\sqrt{2}\\, g$ and $\\delta_{\\rm\nq}=0$, thus leading to $\\chi=0$. The effect of nonzero anharmonicity $\\delta_{\\rm\nq}$ in Eq. (<ref>) is more important than the effect of nonzero\n$\\tilde{g}-\\sqrt{2}\\, g$ because\ng\u0303^2/2-g^2 \u2248- g^2 \u03b4_q/\u03c9_q^b\nand $|\\Delta|\\ll\n\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}$. Therefore $\\chi$ can be approximated as\n\u03c7\u2248-g^2\u03b4_q/\u0394(\u0394-\u03b4_q) \u2248- g^2 \u03b4_q/\u0394^2,\nwhere the last formula also assumes $|\\Delta| \\gg \\delta_{\\rm q}$.\n\nThe dispersive approximation (<ref>) is based on the\napproximate formulas (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>)\nfor the eigenenergies, and therefore requires a limited number of\nphotons $n$ in the resonator,\nn \u226amin(n_crit, \u00f1_crit),\nn_crit =\u0394^2/4g^2,\n\u00f1_crit =(\u0394-\u03b4_q)^2/4g\u0303^2,\nwhere the factor 4 in the definitions of the critical photon numbers\n$n_{\\rm crit}$ and $\\tilde{n}_{\\rm crit}$ is a usual convention. For\n$n$ beyond this range it is still possible (at least to some extent)\nto use the dispersive approximation (<ref>) if the spread of\n$n$ is relatively small; however $\\omega_{\\rm q}$, $\\omega_{\\rm r}$,\nand $\\chi$ should be redefined. For that we need to use similar\nsteps as in Eqs. (<ref>)\u2013(<ref>), but\nstarting with more accurate formulas than (<ref>) and\n(<ref>). In particular, in the two-level approximation\nfor the qubit ($\\tilde{g}=0$ or $\\delta_{\\rm q}=\\infty$) we would\nobtain $\\chi \\approx g^2/\\sqrt{\\Delta^2+4\\bar{n}g^2}$ with $\\bar{n}$\nbeing the average (typical) number of photons; however,\nthe generalization of the realistic case (<ref>) is not so\nsimple (see below).\n\nThe dispersive approximation (<ref>) cannot reproduce the\nPurcell effect [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] after including the last line of the\nHamiltonian (<ref>), so it should be added\nseparately. Without the microwave drive ($\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}=0$)\nonly levels $|e,0\\rangle$, $|g,1\\rangle$ and $|g,0\\rangle$ are\ninvolved into the evolution described by Eq.(<ref>), and for sufficiently small resonator\nbandwidth, $\\kappa \\ll \\sqrt{\\Delta^2+4g^2}$, the qubit relaxation\nrate due to Purcell effect is\n\u0393\u2248\u03ba/2 ( 1-\n|\u0394|/\u221a(\u0394^2+4g^2) ) \u2248g^2 \u03ba/\u0394^2.\nNote that this rate does not depend on the qubit anharmonicity\n$\\delta_{\\rm q}$, in contrast to the dispersive coupling $\\chi$,\nwhich vanishes at $\\delta_{\\rm q} \\rightarrow 0$. This is because\nthe Purcell effect is essentially a linear effect (energy decay via\ndecay of a coupled system), in contrast to $\\chi$, which is based on\nqubit nonlinearity. This linearity is the reason why the Purcell\nrate $\\Gamma$ does not change (in the first approximation) when the\nmicrowave drive $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$ creates a significant photon\npopulation in the resonator, $1\\ll n \\ll \\min (n_{\\rm crit},\n\\tilde{n}_{\\rm crit})$. (Someone might naively expect that $\\Gamma$\nscales with $n$ because of effective coupling $\\sqrt{n}\\, g$.)\nHowever, in the next approximation $\\Gamma$ depends on $n$\n[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and can be calculated as\n\u0393(n) = \u03ba  |\u27e8g, n| a\n|e,n\u27e9|^2,\nwith subsequent replacement of $n$ with the average photon number\n$\\bar{n}$ if the spread of $n$ is relatively small.\n\nUsing the third-order (in $g$ and/or $\\tilde{g}$) eigenstates,\n$$\n\n&    \\overline{|g,n\\rangle } = \\left( 1-\\frac{n\ng^2}{2\\Delta^2}\\right) |g,n\\rangle +\\frac{\\sqrt{n(n-1)}\\, g\n\\tilde{g}}{\\Delta(2\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q})} \\, |f,n-2\\rangle\n\\nonumber \\\\\n& \\hspace{0.5cm}   -\\frac{\\sqrt{n}\\, g}{\\Delta} \\left( 1-\\frac{3n g^2}{2\\Delta^2} + \\frac{(n-1)\\tilde{g}^2}{\\Delta(2\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q})}\\right)  |e,n-1\\rangle ,\n\\label{g,n-eigen}\\\\\n& \\overline{|e,n\\rangle } \\approx \\left( 1-\\frac{(n+1) g^2}{2\\Delta^2}\n-\\frac{n \\tilde{g}^2}{2(\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q})^2}\\right) |e,n\\rangle\n\\nonumber \\\\\n& \\hspace{0.5cm} + \\frac{\\sqrt{n+1}\\, g}{\\Delta} \\left( 1- \\frac{3(n+1) g^2}{2\\Delta^2} +\\frac{n\\tilde{g}^2 (\\Delta-2\\delta_{\\rm q})}{2\\Delta (\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q})^2} \\right)\n\\nonumber \\\\\n& \\hspace{0.5cm} \\times  |g,n+1\\rangle\n-  \\frac{\\sqrt{n}\\, \\tilde{g}}{\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q}} \\,\n|f,n-1\\rangle ,\n\\label{e,n-eigen}\n$$\nwhere the last term in Eq.

This result\ncoincides with the result of Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] when $\\tilde{g}=0$.\nApproximating $\\tilde{g}=\\sqrt{2}\\, g$ [see Eq.(<ref>)], we obtain\n\u0393(n) \u2248\u03bag^2/\u0394^2 (\n1- 3g^2/\u0394^2\n+ n   2g^2 \u03b4_q (2\u0394-3\u03b4_q)/\u0394^2 (\u0394-\u03b4_q)^2 ) .\nIt is interesting to note that while in the two-level approximation\n($\\tilde{g}=0$) the Purcell rate is always suppressed with increasing\n$n$ [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], Eq. (<ref>) shows the suppression only\nwhen $\\Delta < (3/2)\\delta_{\\rm q}$ (which is the usual experimental\ncase, since $\\Delta$ is usually negative). Numerical results using\nEq. (<ref>) show that even when $\\Gamma(n)$ initially\nincreases with $n$, it is still suppressed at larger $n$. Note that the result (<ref>) requires\nassumption (<ref>) of a sufficiently small nonlinearity.\nComparing Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>), we see\nthat in the case of large detuning, $|\\Delta|\\gg \\delta_{\\rm q}$,\nthe dependence of the Purcell rate on $n$ is consistent with the\nexplanation based on the ac Stark shift, $\\Gamma (n)\\approx \\kappa\ng^2/ (\\Delta +2n \\chi)^2$. (This is in contrast to the two-level\napproximation, in which this explanation leads to a discrepancy\nin the slope [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] by a factor of $3/2$.) We have checked that taking into account the fourth level in the qubit does not change Eqs.

This result predicts a quite strong $n$-dependence of $\\chi$, which is, however, not correct. The reason is that it is not sufficient to consider three qubit levels for $\\chi(n)$. When the\nfourth level of the qubit is taken into account (with energy $3\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-3\\delta_{\\rm q}$ and coupling $\\tilde{\\tilde g}$), this does not change Eq.

In the usual case when $\\Delta <0$, the absolute value of $\\chi(n)$ decreases with increasing $n$.\n\nNote that in Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>) we used ${\\tilde g}= \\sqrt{2}\\, g$ and $\\tilde{\\tilde g}= \\sqrt{3}\\, g$. If a better approximation is used,\ng\u0303\u2248\u221a(2)  g   (1-\u03b4_q /2\u03c9_q^b),\ng\u0303\u0303\u0303\u2248\u221a(3)  g   (1-\u03b4_q /\u03c9_q^b),\nthen correction to the $\\tilde g^2$-term in Eq. (<ref>) creates an additional contribution $g^2\\delta_{\\rm q}/[\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}(\\Delta-\\delta_{\\rm q})]$ to $\\chi$, which for typical parameters is much larger than the second terms in Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>). The correction (<ref>) also yields an additional $n$-dependent contribution of\napproximately $2g^4\\delta_{\\rm q}n/(\\Delta^3\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b})$ (assuming $\\delta_{\\rm q}\\ll |\\Delta |$) to both $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|g\\rangle}(n)$ and $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}(n)$. These additional slopes are comparable to the slope of $\\chi(n)$ in Eq. (<ref>) because $\\Delta^2/(\\delta_{\\rm q}\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b})$ is on the order of 1 for typical experimental parameters. However, the contribution to $\\chi(n)$ from the correction (<ref>) is only $9 g^4\\delta_{\\rm q}^2n/(\\Delta^4 \\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b})$ (assuming $\\delta_{\\rm q}\\ll |\\Delta |$), which is smaller than the last term in Eq. (<ref>) because $|\\Delta |\\ll\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}$. Therefore, the slope of $\\chi(n)$ in Eq. (<ref>) is practically not affected by the correction (<ref>). Similarly, inaccuracy of our approximation of the fourth qubit level energy by $3\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-3\\delta_{\\rm q}$ produces only a small correction to the slope of $\\chi(n)$: the correction to the fourth-level energy is on the order of $\\delta_{\\rm q}^2/\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}$, and therefore the correction to $\\chi (n)$ [via Eq. (<ref>)] is on the order of $g^4\\delta_{\\rm q}^2n/(\\Delta^4 \\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b})$ for $\\delta_{\\rm q}\\ll |\\Delta |$.\n\nThus, we see that for a transmon or Xmon qubit, calculation of $\\chi (0)$ requires at least three qubit levels to be taken into account, while the first correction due to $\\chi (n)$ dependence ($n\\ll n_{\\rm crit}$) requires at least four qubit levels to be considered. In contrast, calculation of the Purcell rate $\\Gamma (0)$ requires two qubit levels, while the first correction due to $\\Gamma (n)$ dependence requires three qubit levels.\n\n### Measurement error\nNow let us discuss the qubit measurement error caused by the qubit\nrelaxation due to Purcell effect.  To describe measurement, we will\nuse the dispersive approximation (<ref>) with\n$\\chi=-g^2\\delta_{\\rm q}/\\Delta^2$ [Eq. (<ref>)] and\nneglect the small difference between $\\Delta$ defined in Eq.(<ref>) and $\\omega_{\\rm q}-\\omega_{\\rm r}$ defined via\nEq. (<ref>). For the Purcell rate we will use the\nsimplest form $\\Gamma = g^2\\kappa/\\Delta^2$. Both approximations\nassume a sufficiently small number of photons, Eq.(<ref>).\n\nAssuming that the qubit is either in the state $|g\\rangle$ or\n$|e\\rangle$ (non-evolving), from Eq. (<ref>) we see that the\neffective resonator frequency is constant in time, $\\omega_{\\rm\nr}\\pm \\chi$, where the upper sign is for the state $|e\\rangle$ and\nthe lower sign is for $|g\\rangle$. The corresponding resonator state\nis a coherent state $|\\alpha_{\\pm}\\rangle$, characterized by an\namplitude $\\alpha_{\\pm}(t)$ in the rotating frame based on the drive\nfrequency $\\omega_{\\rm d}$ [in the lab frame the resonator wave\nfunction is $e^{-|\\alpha_\\pm|^2/2}\\sum_n (\\alpha_\\pm e^{-i\\omega_d\nt})^n n^{-1/2} |n\\rangle$ up to an overall phase]. The evolution of\nthe amplitude is\n\n\u03b1\u0307_\u00b1= -i (\u0394_rd \u00b1\u03c7)  \u03b1_\u00b1\n-\u03ba/2  \u03b1_\u00b1 -i\u03b5_r,\n\nwhere the upper sign everywhere is for the state $|e\\rangle$,\n\u0394_rd = \u03c9_r-\u03c9_d,\nand complex $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r} (t)$ can in general depend on time to\ndescribe a drive with changing amplitude and frequency. (Note a difference in notation compared with the main text: now $\\Delta_{\\rm rd}$ does not depend on the qubit state and the frequency shift $\\pm \\chi$ is added explicitly.) The steady\nstate for a steady drive, $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}= {\\rm const}$, is\n\u03b1_\u00b1= -i\u03b5_r/\u03ba/2+i(\u0394_rd \u00b1\u03c7),\nso that the two coherent states are separated by\n\u03b1_+ -\u03b1_- = -2\u03b5_r\u03c7/(\u03ba/2+i\u0394_rd)^2+\u03c7^2,\nand this is the difference, which can be sensed by the homodyne\ndetection (it does not matter whether the microwave is transmitted or reflected from the resonator when we discuss the measurement in terms of $\\alpha_{\\pm}$).\n\nIn the case when $\\Delta_{\\rm rd}=0$ (so that $\\omega_{\\rm\nd}=\\omega_{\\rm r}$), both states have the same average number of\nphotons, $\\bar{n}=|\\alpha_+|^2=|\\alpha_-|^2=|\\varepsilon_{\\rm\nr}|^2/(\\kappa^2/4+\\chi^2)$, and the absolute value of the state\nseparation is\n\u03b4\u03b1\u2261| \u03b1_+ -\u03b1_-|= 2 \u221a(n\u0305)/\u221a((\u03ba/2\u03c7)^2+1).\n\nTheoretically, the distinguishability of two coherent states separated by\n$\\delta\\alpha$ is the same as the distinguishability of two Gaussians\nwith width (standard deviation) of 1/2 each, separated by\n$\\delta\\alpha$. However, a measurement for the duration $t_{\\rm m}$\nincreases the effective separation by a factor of $\\sqrt{\\kappa\nt_{\\rm m}}$, while imperfect quantum efficiency $\\eta$ of the\nmeasurement (mainly due to the amplifier noise) increases the\nGaussian width by $\\eta^{-1/2}$ or, equivalently, decreases the\neffective separation by $\\eta^{-1/2}$. Therefore, we may think about the\ndistinguishability of two Gaussians with width 1/2 each, separated\nby\n\u03b4\u03b1_eff = \u221a(\u03b7\u03bat_m)\n\u03b4\u03b1,\nwhich gives the error probability due to state separation\nP_err^sep=1-Erf(\u03b4\u03b1_eff/\u221a(2))/2 \u2248exp[-(\u03b4\u03b1_eff)^2/2]/\u221a(2\u03c0) \u03b4\u03b1_eff  .\n\nThe other contribution to the measurement error $P_{\\rm err}$ for the state $|e\\rangle$ comes\nfrom the qubit energy relaxation with the rate $\\Gamma+T_{1,\\rm\nint}^{-1}$ during the measurement time $t_{\\rm m}$,\nP_err=  P_err^sep + 1/2  t_m (\u0393+T_1,int^-1),\nwhere the factor $1/2$ is because the relaxation moment is distributed practically uniformly within the measurement duration $t_{\\rm m}$.\nSince $P_{\\rm err}^{\\rm sep}$ decreases with time $t_{\\rm m}$\nexponentially, the main limitation for $P_{\\rm err}$ comes from the\nsecond term.\n\nIt is easy to find that $ P_{\\rm err}^{\\rm sep}=10^{-2}$ corresponds\nto $\\delta\\alpha_{\\rm eff}=2.3$, $ P_{\\rm err}^{\\rm sep}=10^{-3}$\ncorresponds to $\\delta\\alpha_{\\rm eff}=3.1$, and $ P_{\\rm err}^{\\rm\nsep}=10^{-4}$ corresponds to $\\delta\\alpha_{\\rm eff}=3.7$. For an\nestimate let us choose $\\delta\\alpha_{\\rm eff}\\agt 3$. Then from\nEq. (<ref>) $t_{\\rm m}\\agt\n9/(\\eta\\kappa\\,\\delta\\alpha^2)$, and therefore even neglecting\nintrinsic relaxation $T_{1,\\rm int}^{-1}$ in Eq. (<ref>), we\nobtain the condition\n\u03931/4 P_err\u03b7\u03ba(\u03b4\u03b1)^2.\nNow using $\\Gamma=\\kappa g^2/\\Delta^2$ and assuming $\\kappa \\agt 2\\, |\\chi |$\nin Eq. (<ref>), so that $\\delta\\alpha \\simeq 4\\chi\n\\sqrt{\\nbar}/\\kappa$,\nwe rewrite this condition as\n\u03ba2 \u221a(P_err\u03b7)   |\u03c7|/|g|  \u22432 \u221a(P_err\u03b7)\n|g\u03b4_q|/|\u0394|,\nwhere for the second expression we used $\\chi \\simeq -g^2\\delta_{\\rm q}/\\Delta^2$.\nSince the measurement time $t_{\\rm m}$ should be at least few times\nlonger than $\\kappa^{-1}$, we obtain\nt_m >4/\u03ba 2/\u221a(P_err\u03b7)   |\u0394|/|g\u03b4_q| =4/\u03b4_q/\u221a(P_err\u03b7)\u221a(/n_crit).\n\nThese estimates show that the Purcell effect requires a sufficiently long measurement time when we desire a small measurement error $P_{\\rm err}$. The limitation is not severe, but it is still inconsistent with a fast accurate measurement needed for quantum error correction. As an example, from Eq. (<ref>) we see that for $\\delta_{\\rm q}/2\\pi\\simeq 200\\, {\\rm MHz}$, $P_{\\rm err}\\simeq 10^{-3}$, $\\eta \\simeq 0.3$ and $\\nbar \\simeq n_{\\rm crit}/4$ we need $t_m >400\\,{\\rm ns}$ (this in turn would require a very long $T_{1, \\rm int}$). Also, the detuning should be sufficiently large,\n|\u0394/g|>\u221a(\u03bat_m/2P_err)>\u221a(2/P_err),\nas directly follows from $\\Gamma =\\kappa (g/\\Delta)^2$ and $\\kappa t_{\\rm m} >4$.\n\nAs a more detailed example, let us choose $g/2\\pi \\simeq 30\\, {\\rm MHz}$, $\\Delta/2\\pi \\simeq -1.35\\, {\\rm GHz}$, $\\delta_{\\rm q}/2\\pi\\simeq 200\\, {\\rm MHz}$, $\\kappa^{-1}\\simeq 100 \\, {\\rm ns}$, $t_{\\rm m}\\simeq 400 \\, {\\rm ns}$, $\\eta\\simeq 0.3$, and $\\nbar\\simeq n_{\\rm crit}/4\\simeq 125$. Then for the excited qubit state the Purcell decay brings the error contribution $t_{\\rm m}\\Gamma /2\\simeq 10^{-3}$; the dispersive coupling is $\\chi /2\\pi \\simeq -0.1 \\, {\\rm MHz}$, so $\\delta \\alpha \\simeq 0.25\\sqrt{\\nbar}\\simeq 2.8$ and $\\delta\\alpha_{\\rm eff}\\simeq 3$, so the separation error is also about $10^{-3}$ [actually slightly larger since $|\\chi|$ decreases with $\\nbar$ for negative $\\Delta$ \u2013 see Eq. (<ref>)].\n\nThus, we see that even with the qubit decay due to the Purcell effect, it is possible to measure a qubit with a low measurement error, but this requires a relatively long time and large resonator-qubit detuning. Note that we also had to assume a large number of photons in the resonator, which can lead to detrimental effects (neglected in our analysis) such as dressed dephasing [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and various imperfections related to nonlinear dynamics. Suppression of the Purcell effect (using a Purcell filter or other means) allows us to significantly increase the ratio $|g/\\Delta|$, thus increasing the coupling $\\chi$ and correspondingly decreasing the measurement time for the same measurement error.\n\n99\n\nN-C-book M.

Dissipated power at the temperature stages of the DR when applying a microwave tone at 5 GHz and a power of 16 dBm, corresponding to a signal level of -52.5 dBm at MXC. Shown are measured data (blue rectangles, solid line) and results of calculations (red triangles, dashed line).\n\nTo experimentally test loads due to signal dissipation we apply a RF signal at one of the drive lines, and measure the corresponding temperature increases on the stages in the dilution refrigerator. In particular, we attempt to evaluate whether the power dissipated in an attenuator predominantly flows to the stage on which the attenuator is thermalized, or whether part of that heat flows to the next lower stage. This is important because the signal levels at stages with attenuators differ by 20 dB in the selected attenuator configuration of C3={0, 20, 0, 20, 20} dB. In other words, the power dissipated in an attenuator at the 4K (CP) stage is by a factor 100 larger than the power dissipated in the attenuator at the CP (MXC) stage. Hence, if only a small fraction of heat dissipated in an attenuator at a given stage flows towards the lower temperature stages, this can significantly increase the heat load on these stages.\n\nWe first apply a power of 10 dBm at a frequency of 10 MHz, at which dissipation in the RF cables themselves is negligible. This allows for a simple comparison with the expected loads of 10 mW on the 4K stage, 100 $\\mu$W on CP, and 1 $\\mu$W on MXC. Using our reference measurements, we extract an active load of $11.5(1.6)\\,$mW on the 4K stage, 95(9) $\\mu$W on CP, 1.1(1) $\\mu$W on MXC, in agreement with the predicted values and showing that there is no significant extra load on these stages due to signal dissipation on higher stages. However, we measured a non-zero active load of 48(6) $\\mu$W on the Still stage, which we attribute to a small fraction of the dissipated power at 4K (about 0.4\n\nWe next apply a signal at 5 GHz with a power of 16 dBm such that the resulting temperature increases on the lower stages are well measurable. To calculate the power level at MXC, we have to take into account the attenuation in the cables [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], see Appendix <ref>.\n\nThe total attenuation in the cables sums up to about 8.5 dB, and with the 60 dB of discrete attenuation yields a signal level at MXC of about -52.5 dBm, much larger than the average value of -78 dBm required in a drive line, see Section <ref>. To predict an active load per drive line the extracted pure active loads shown as blue rectangles in Fig. (Figure fig:dissipation-driveline) need to be scaled down accordingly. On the stages with attenuators the data agrees well with the estimated active loads (red triangles). In our calculations we attribute one half of the dissipated power in a cable section itself (excluding the attenuators) to the stage above and the other half to the stage below. On the Still stage the measured load is by a factor two larger than estimated, which is consistent with the above observation made at a signal frequency of 10 MHz.\n\nThe active load per TWPA pump line is found to be comparable to the active load per drive line, with a dominating contribution of 0.23 $\\mu$W on the CP stage. This is a result of a pump power of about -65 dB required at the input of the TWPA and the pump line having 10 dB less attenuation than the drive lines.\n\nSummarizing, we have experimentally verified the predicted active loads for the selected attenuator configuration in the drive lines as presented in Fig. (Figure fig:signal-dissipation) b. Since this configuration has been chosen to keep the active load significantly below the available cooling powers, the active load due to execution of single-qubit gates has a negligible influence on the temperature of the quantum processor. Whether the thermal photon number is as low as predicted needs to be measured [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and would provide information about the effective temperatures at which the attenuators emit blackbody radiation."}
{"prompt": "Explain the 'Leakage transitions' section of the paper.", "completion": "Driving a single transition in a system of uncoupled qubits is generally equivalent to a single-qubit rotation of some kind. For our CZ gate, such a transition is only entangling provided no other transitions from other initial states are also being driven. This is only possible when coupling terms adjust the energy levels involved in these transitions. To map out the landscape of the relevant higher-level transitions, we performed two-tone spectroscopy as a function of the coupler flux, heralding different initial states:\u00a0$\\ket{000}$, $\\ket{100}$, $\\ket{001}$, and\u00a0$\\ket{101}$ [fig:sup_sidebands]. As demonstrated in the main text, any transition in fig:sup_sidebandsd could be used to perform the CZ gate, provided it is sufficiently detuned from any transitions involving the other initial states. Equivalently, though not explored in this work, a CZ gate could be performed by driving selective transitions from a different initial state and then performing appropriate\u00a0$Z$ rotations to transfer the\u00a0$180^\\circ$ conditional phase shift onto the\u00a0$\\ket{11}$ state.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nTwo-tone spectroscopy of the higher energy levels of the FTF system.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Resonator Coupling' section of the paper.", "completion": "A resonator is coupled to a feedline by creating a capacitive or inductive link. The fraction of the resonator's total capacitance or inductance respectively that is used for this circuit element should be carefully tuned to ensure a close match between $Q_i$ and $Q_c$ at the temperature and power of interest in order to measure the resonator's loss accurately. For $Q_c \\ll Q_i$, $Q_c$ dominates the signal vs.\u00a0frequency lineshape and the accuracy of measured $Q_i$ is decreased. For $Q_c \\gg Q_i$, the resonator becomes difficult to measure due to reduced signal <cit.>. Thus, in order to be able to accurately measure resonator $Q_i$, we must either first estimate the order of magnitude of $Q_i$ or measure a series of resonators with varied $Q_c$ values and use the data from the resonator with the closest match between $Q_i$ and $Q_c$.\n\nTheoretically, if an accurate equivalent circuit model of a resonator measurement setup is known, the coupling loss can be calculated by $1/Q_c=\\mathrm{Re}[Y(\\omega_0)]Z_r$, where $Y(\\omega_0)$ is the total admittance to ground through the coupling components at resonance frequency and $Z_r=\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{C}}$ is the characteristic impedance of the resonator <cit.>. Performing microwave simulations of the design with lossless materials (i.e., $Q = Q_c$) and estimating the total $Q$ by measuring the bandwidth of the resonance dip or peak is a standard way to determine $Q_c$ for a given design prior to fabrication and measurement. Other simulation methods have also been developed that greatly improve the speed of measurement by examining the impedance of a virtual internal port <cit.>.

{"prompt": "Explain the 'S-parameters of RF lines' section of the paper.", "completion": "Typical S-parameter response curves of the installed drive lines and flux lines are shown in Fig. (Figure fig:S_parameters) a. Each line has been measured from the port on the vacuum flange (Port 1) to the port at the MXC flange (Port 2), using a vector network analyzer (VNA). The drive lines typically achieve reflection parameters below -20dB from 0 to 12 GHz, and below -25dB in the range of 4-8 GHz, which is most relevant for the applied microwave pulses. For lines with an Eccosorb filter we choose to position it before the attenuator at MXC such that the line is well impedance matched also at Port 2 even if the Eccosorb filter itself is not perfectly impedance matched.\n\nThe transmission coefficients confirm that the signal loss at DC frequencies is set by the installed attenuators (3x 20dB). For higher frequencies, the transmission coefficients decrease as expected due to the frequency dependent signal loss in the cables and Eccosorb filter.\n\nThe transmission spectrum of the flux line starts at -10 dB, corresponding to the 10 dB attenuator installed at the 4K stage, and sharply drops at $2\\,$GHz due to a low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 1.3 GHz, see Fig. (Figure fig:S_parameters) b. The continuous drop between 0 and 2 GHz is due to a combination of frequency dependent loss in cable and Eccosorb filter. The reflection S22 from the sample side towards the Eccosorb filter is below -20 dB in the range of 0-500 MHz.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Drive lines' section of the paper.", "completion": "< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDissipation in drive lines. Dissipated power at the temperature stages of the DR when applying a microwave tone at 5 GHz and a power of 16 dBm, corresponding to a signal level of -52.5 dBm at MXC. Shown are measured data (blue rectangles, solid line) and results of calculations (red triangles, dashed line).\n\nTo experimentally test loads due to signal dissipation we apply a RF signal at one of the drive lines, and measure the corresponding temperature increases on the stages in the dilution refrigerator. In particular, we attempt to evaluate whether the power dissipated in an attenuator predominantly flows to the stage on which the attenuator is thermalized, or whether part of that heat flows to the next lower stage. This is important because the signal levels at stages with attenuators differ by 20 dB in the selected attenuator configuration of C3={0, 20, 0, 20, 20} dB. In other words, the power dissipated in an attenuator at the 4K (CP) stage is by a factor 100 larger than the power dissipated in the attenuator at the CP (MXC) stage. Hence, if only a small fraction of heat dissipated in an attenuator at a given stage flows towards the lower temperature stages, this can significantly increase the heat load on these stages.\n\nWe first apply a power of 10 dBm at a frequency of 10 MHz, at which dissipation in the RF cables themselves is negligible. This allows for a simple comparison with the expected loads of 10 mW on the 4K stage, 100 $\\mu$W on CP, and 1 $\\mu$W on MXC. Using our reference measurements, we extract an active load of $11.5(1.6)\\,$mW on the 4K stage, 95(9) $\\mu$W on CP, 1.1(1) $\\mu$W on MXC, in agreement with the predicted values and showing that there is no significant extra load on these stages due to signal dissipation on higher stages. However, we measured a non-zero active load of 48(6) $\\mu$W on the Still stage, which we attribute to a small fraction of the dissipated power at 4K (about 0.4\n\nWe next apply a signal at 5 GHz with a power of 16 dBm such that the resulting temperature increases on the lower stages are well measurable. To calculate the power level at MXC, we have to take into account the attenuation in the cables [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], see Appendix <ref>.\n\nThe total attenuation in the cables sums up to about 8.5 dB, and with the 60 dB of discrete attenuation yields a signal level at MXC of about -52.5 dBm, much larger than the average value of -78 dBm required in a drive line, see Section <ref>. To predict an active load per drive line the extracted pure active loads shown as blue rectangles in Fig. (Figure fig:dissipation-driveline) need to be scaled down accordingly. On the stages with attenuators the data agrees well with the estimated active loads (red triangles). In our calculations we attribute one half of the dissipated power in a cable section itself (excluding the attenuators) to the stage above and the other half to the stage below. On the Still stage the measured load is by a factor two larger than estimated, which is consistent with the above observation made at a signal frequency of 10 MHz.\n\nThe active load per TWPA pump line is found to be comparable to the active load per drive line, with a dominating contribution of 0.23 $\\mu$W on the CP stage. This is a result of a pump power of about -65 dB required at the input of the TWPA and the pump line having 10 dB less attenuation than the drive lines.\n\nSummarizing, we have experimentally verified the predicted active loads for the selected attenuator configuration in the drive lines as presented in Fig. (Figure fig:signal-dissipation) b. Since this configuration has been chosen to keep the active load significantly below the available cooling powers, the active load due to execution of single-qubit gates has a negligible influence on the temperature of the quantum processor. Whether the thermal photon number is as low as predicted needs to be measured [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and would provide information about the effective temperatures at which the attenuators emit blackbody radiation."}

On the path to quantum error correction (QEC) and fault tolerance\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], recent experiments have used repetitive parity measurements to stabilize two-qubit entanglement\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and to perform surface-code quantum error detection in a 7-transmon processor\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. These developments have relied on two-qubit controlled-phase (CP) gates realized by dynamical flux control of transmon frequency, harnessing the transverse coupling $\\Jtwo$ between a computational state $\\ket{11}$ and a non-computational state such as $\\ket{02}$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Compared to other implementations, e.g., cross-resonance using microwave-frequency pulses \u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and parametric radio-frequency pulsing\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], baseband flux pulses achieve the fastest controlled-$Z$ (CZ) gates (a special case of CP), operating near the speed limit $\\tlim=\\pi/\\Jtwo$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nOver the last decade, baseband flux pulsing for two-qubit gating has evolved in a continuous effort to increase gate fidelity and to reduce leakage and residual $ZZ$ coupling. In particular, leakage has become a main focus for its negative impact on QEC, adding complexity to error-decoder design\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and requiring hardware and operational overhead to seep\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nTo reduce leakage from linear-dynamical distortion in flux-control lines and limited time resolution in arbitrary waveform generators (AWGs), unipolar square pulses\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] have been superseded by softened unipolar pulses\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] based on fast-adiabatic theory\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In parallel, coupling strengths have reduced roughly fourfold (to $\\Jtwo/2\\pi \\sim 10\\mathrm{-}20~\\MHz$) to reduce residual $ZZ$ coupling, which affects single-qubit gates and idling at bias points, and produces crosstalk from spectator qubits\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Many groups are actively developing tunable coupling schemes to suppress residual coupling without incurring slowdown\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nA main limitation to the fidelity of flux-based CP gates is dephasing from flux noise, as one qubit is displaced $0.5\\mathrm{-}1~\\GHz$ below its flux-symmetry point (i.e., sweetspot\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]) to reach the $\\ket{11}$-$\\ket{02}$ resonance. To address this limitation, Ref.\u00a0Rol19 recently introduced a bipolar variant [termed Net Zero (NZ)] of the fast-adiabatic scheme, which provides a built-in echo reducing the impact of low-frequency flux noise. The double use of the transverse interaction also reduces leakage by destructive interference, as understood by analogy with a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). Finally, the zero-average characteristic avoids the buildup of long-timescale distortions remaining in flux-control lines after compensation, significantly improving gate repeatability. NZ pulsing has been successfully used in several recent experiments\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], elevating the state of the art for CZ gate fidelity in a multi-transmon processor to $99.72\\pm0.35\\%$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, NZ suffers from complicated tuneup, owing to the complex dependence of conditional phase and leakage on fast-adiabatic pulse parameters. This complication limits the use of NZ for two-qubit gating as quantum processors grow in qubit count.\n\nIn this Letter, we introduce the sudden variant (SNZ) of the Net Zero scheme implementing CZ gates using baseband flux pulsing.\nSNZ offers two key advantages while preserving the built-in echo, destructive leakage interference, and repeatability characteristic of conventional NZ.\nFirst, SNZ operates at the speed limit of transverse coupling by maximizing intermediate leakage to the non-computational state.\nThe second and main advantage is greatly simplified tuneup: the landscapes of conditional phase and leakage as a function of two pulse parameters have very regular structure and interrelation, easily understood by exact analogy to the MZI.\nWe realize SNZ CZ gates among four pairs of nearest neighbors in a seven-transmon processor and characterize their performance using two-qubit interleaved randomized benchmarking (2QIRB) with\nmodifications to quantify leakage\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The highest performance achieved has $99.93\\pm 0.24\\%$ fidelity with $0.10 \\pm 0.02\\%$ corresponding leakage.\nUsing numerical simulation with experimental input parameters, we dissect an error budget finding SNZ to slightly outperform conventional NZ.\nSNZ CZ gates are fully compatible with scalable approaches to QEC\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThe generalization of SNZ to arbitrary CP gates is straightforward and useful for optimization\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], quantum simulation\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and other noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) applications\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nA flux pulse harnessing the $\\ket{11}$-$\\ket{02}$ interaction implements the unitary\n\n= [              1              0              0              0              0;              0            e^i              0              0              0;              0              0            e^i              0              0;              0              0              0      \u221a(1-4)e^i  \u221a(4)e^\u03d5_02,11;              0              0              0 \u221a(4)e^i\u03d5_11,02     \u221a(1-4) e^i;                ]\n\nin the $\\{ \\ket{00},\\ket{01},\\ket{10}, \\ket{11}, \\ket{02}\\}$ subspace, neglecting decoherence and residual interaction between far off-resonant levels.\nHere, $\\phizo$ and $\\phioz$ are the single-qubit phases, and $\\phioo=\\phizo+\\phioz+\\phitwoq$, where $\\phitwoq$ is the conditional phase.\nFinally, $\\Lone$ is the leakage parameter.\n\nIn a rotating frame which absorbs the single-qubit phases, the system Hamiltonian is\n\nH =   (t) |02\u27e9\u27e802|+ ( |02\u27e9\u27e811|+ |11\u27e9\u27e802|),\n\nwhere $\\Dzt(t)$ is the dynamical detuning between $\\ket{02}$ and $\\ket{11}$.\nEach half of the bipolar NZ pulse implements the unitary\n\n==[ \u03b1 e^i \u03b2 e^i; \u03b2 e^i \u03b1 e^i;       ],\n\nin the $\\{ \\ket{11}, \\ket{02} \\}$ subspace, where $\\alpha,\\beta \\in \\left[0,1\\right]$ satisfy $\\alpha^2+\\beta^2=1$ and $\\phia+\\phid=\\phib+\\phic+\\pi~(\\modulo~2\\pi)$.\nIn the MZI analogy, this unitary is the action of each (ideally identical) beamsplitter.\n\nIn SNZ, each half pulse is a square pulse with amplitude $\\pm A$ and duration $\\tp/2=\\tlim/2$.\nSNZ intentionally adds an idling period $\\ttwoq$ between the half pulses to perfect the analogy to the MZI (Fig.\u00a01 inset), allowing accrual of relative phase $\\phi$ in between the beamsplitters.\nThe unitary action of this idling is\n\n= [    1    0;    0 e^i\u03d5;      ].\n\nAn ideal CZ gate, our target here, achieves $\\phizo=\\phioz=0~(\\modulo~2\\pi)$, $\\phitwoq=\\pi~(\\modulo~2\\pi)$ (phase condition PC), and $\\Lone=0$ (leakage condition LC), with arbitrary $\\phizt$.

(a) The flux pulse has $\\tp=\\tlim$ and variable $A$ and $\\ttwoq$. Amplitude $A$ is normalized to the $\\ket{11}$-$\\ket{02}$ resonance. (b, c) Landscapes of conditional phase $\\phitwoq$ (b) and leakage $\\Lone$ (c) as a function of $A$ and $\\ttwoq$. Dashed curves are contours of $\\phitwoq=180\\degrees$. In (c), the vertical valley at $A=1$ is due to LC3: each half pulse fully transmits $\\ket{11}$ to $\\ket{02}$, and vice versa. The other two vertical valleys are due to LC1: each half pulse implements a complete (off-resonant) oscillation and thus perfectly reflects.\nThe diagonal valleys are due to LC2.\nNote the simultaneous overlap of $\\phitwoq=180\\degrees$ contours with the crossing of LC3 and LC2 valleys.\nThese crossing points occur at $A=1$ and $\\ttwoq$ satisfying $\\Dzt\\ttwoq=0~(\\modulo~2\\pi)$.\n\nThe key advantage of SNZ over conventional NZ is the very straightforward procedure to simultaneously meet PC and LC3.\nTo appreciate this, consider first the ideal scenario where the pulses can have infinite time resolution. For, $\\tp=\\tlim$, $\\ttwoq=0$ ($\\phi=0$), and $A=1$ ($\\Dzt=0$) each half pulse implements an iSWAP gate between $\\ket{11}$ and $\\ket{02}$. Thus, $\\alpha=0$ (meeting LC3) and $\\phib=\\phic=-\\pi/2$ (meeting PC). In the MZI analogy, the first beamsplitter fully transmits $\\ket{11}$ to $-i\\!\\ket{02}$ (producing maximal intermediate leakage), and the second fully transmits $-i\\!\\ket{02}$ to $-\\!\\ket{11}$.\n\nConsider now the effect of non-zero $\\ttwoq$. The idealized two-qutrit numerical simulation with infinite time resolution and no decoherence in Fig.\u00a01 shows that the landscapes of $\\phitwoq$ and  $\\Lone$ as a function of $A$ and $\\ttwoq$ have a clear structure and link to each other. Evidently, $\\UmA\\UB\\UA$ is $2\\pi$-periodic in $\\phi$, so both landscapes are vertically periodic.\nThe  $\\Lone(A,\\ttwoq)$ landscape shows a vertical leakage valley at $A=1$, where LC3 is met.\nLC2 gives rise to additional, diagonally running valleys. Juxtaposing the contour of $\\phitwoq=180\\degrees$ shows that PC is met at the crossing points between these valleys.\nIn this way, this regular leakage landscape provides useful crosshairs for simultaneously meeting PC.\nWe note that along the LC3 vertical valley, $\\phitwoq$ changes monotonically as a function of $\\ttwoq$, allowing the realization of CP gates with any desired $\\phitwoq$.\nWe leave this useful generalization for future work, focusing here on CZ gates.\n\nWhile in this idealized scenario the idling period is not needed, there are practical reasons to include $\\ttwoq$ in experiment: any flux-pulse distortion remaining from the first half pulse during the second (e.g., due to finite pulse rise time) will break the symmetry $\\UmA\\!=\\!\\UA$. Due to the time resolution $\\ts$ of the AWG used for flux control, $\\phi$ can only increment in steps of $-\\Dzt\\ts$, where $\\Dzt$ is the detuning at the bias point. As typically $\\Dzt/2\\pi=0.5\\mathrm{-}1~\\GHz$ and $\\ts\\sim 1~\\ns$, one may only use the number of intermediate sampling points for very coarse control. For fine control, we propose to use the amplitude $\\pm B$ of the first and last sampling points during $\\ttwoq$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nWith these considerations, we turn to the experimental realization of SNZ CZ gates between the nearest-neighbor pairs among four transmons in a 7-transmon processor. High- and low-frequency transmons ($\\QH$ and $\\QL$, respectively) connect to two mid-frequency transmons ($\\QMone$ and $\\QMtwo$) using bus resonators dedicated to each pair. Each transmon has a flux-control line for two-qubit gating, a microwave-drive line for single-qubit gating, and a dispersively coupled resonator with Purcell filter for readout\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. All transmons can be measured simultaneously by frequency multiplexing using a common feedline. See\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for device details and a summary of measured transmon parameters, single-qubit-gate and readout performance. Each transmon is biased at its sweetspot using static flux bias to counter residual offsets. Flux pulsing is performed using a Zurich Instruments HDAWG-8 $(\\ts=1/2.4~\\ns)$. Following prior work\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ],  we measure the linear-dynamical distortions in the flux-control lines using the Cryoscope technique and correct them using real-time filters built into the AWG.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nCalibration of the SNZ pulse for pair $\\QL$-$\\QMtwo$ and comparison to simulation.\n(a) $\\ket{2}$-state population of $\\QMtwo$ as a function of the amplitude and duration of a unipolar square pulse making $\\ket{11}$ interact with $\\ket{02}$.\nThe characteristic chevron pattern is used to identify $\\tlim$ and the amplitude bringing $\\ket{11}$ and $\\ket{02}$ on resonance. (b,c) Landscapes of conditional phase $\\phitwoq$ and leakage estimate $\\Loneexp$ as a function of SNZ pulse amplitudes $A$ and $B$, with $\\tp=\\tlimp$ and $\\ttwoq=1.67~\\ns$. Note that the juxtaposed $\\phitwoq=180\\degrees$ contour runs along the opposite diagonal compared to Figs.\u00a01(b,c) because increasing $B$ (which decreases $\\Dzt$) changes $\\phi$ in the opposite direction from $\\ttwoq$. Data points marked with dots are measured with extra averaging for detailed examination in Fig.\u00a03.\n(d) Numerical simulation of leakage $\\Lone$ landscape and $\\phitwoq=180\\degrees$ contour. The simulation uses pulse and transmon parameters from experiment (neglecting decoherence), and includes the measured final flux-pulse distortion.\nAll landscapes are sampled using an adaptive algorithm based on\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nWe exemplify the tuneup of SNZ pulses using pair $\\QL$-$\\QMtwo$ (Fig.\u00a02). We first identify $\\tlim$ for the $\\ket{11}$-$\\ket{02}$ interaction and the amplitude $A$ bringing the two levels on resonance.\n(The rightmost index indicates the excitation level of the fluxed transmon, here $\\QMtwo$). These parameters are extracted from the characteristic chevron pattern of $\\ket{2}$-population in $\\QMtwo$  as a function of the amplitude and duration of a unipolar square flux pulse acting on $\\ket{11}$ [Fig.\u00a02(a)]. The chevron symmetry axis corresponds to $A=1$ and the oscillation period along this axis gives $\\tlim$. We set $\\tp=\\tlimp \\equiv 2n\\ts$, where $n$ is the smallest integer satisfying $2n\\ts \\geq \\tlim$. Next, we measure the landscapes of $\\phitwoq$ and leakage estimate\u00a0$\\Loneexp$ in the range $A\\in\\left[0.9, 1.1\\right]$, $B\\in\\left[0,A\\right]$. These quantities are extracted from the conditional-oscillation experiments described in\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. As expected, the landscape of $\\Loneexp$ [Fig.\u00a02(c)] reveals  a vertical valley at $A=1$ and a diagonal valley. Juxtaposing the $\\phitwoq=180\\degrees$ contour extracted from the $\\phitwoq$ landscape [Fig.\u00a02(b)], we observe the matching of PC at the crossing of these valleys. These experimental observations are in excellent agreement with a numerical two-qutrit simulation [Fig.\u00a02(d)].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nLandscapes of the leakage estimate $\\Loneexp$ for (a) intentionally short $(\\tp=\\tlimp-6 \\ts)$ and (b) intentionally long $(\\tp=\\tlimp+6\\ts)$ flux pulses on $\\QMtwo$.\nThese landscapes are sampled using an adaptive algorithm based on\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n(c) Extracted $\\Loneexp$ along the $\\phitwoq=180\\degrees$ contours from (a), (b), and Fig.\u00a02(c). For $\\tp<\\tlim$, a single minimum is observed, but at a higher value than the minimum for $\\tp=\\tlimp$. For $\\tp>\\tlim$, two leakage minima are found, matching the single minimum for $\\tp=\\tlimp$.\n\nExperimentally, it is nearly impossible to precisely match $\\tp=\\tlim$ due to the discrete $\\ts$. To understand the possible consequences of $\\tp$ mismatch, we examine the $\\phitwoq$ and $\\Loneexp$ landscapes for SNZ pulses with intentionally set $\\tp = \\tlimp \\pm 6 \\ts$ (Fig.\u00a03). We find that the PC contour remains roughly unchanged in both cases. However, there are significant effects on $\\Loneexp$. In both cases, we observe that $\\Loneexp$ lifts at the prior crossing of LC2 and LC3 valleys where $\\phitwoq=180\\degrees$. For too-short pulses [Fig.\u00a03(a)], there remain two valleys of minimal $\\Loneexp$, but these are now curved and do not cross the $\\phitwoq=180\\degrees$ contour. For too-long pulses [Fig.\u00a03(b)], there are also two curved valleys. Crucially, these cross the $\\phitwoq=180\\degrees$ contour, and it remains possible to achieve PC and minimize leakage at two $(A,B)$ settings. Extracting $\\Loneexp$ along the $\\phitwoq=180\\degrees$ contours  [Fig.\u00a03(c)] confirms that the minimal leakage obtainable for $\\tp = \\tlimp + 6\\ts$ matches that for $\\tp=\\tlimp$.  The observed impossibility to achieve minimal leakage at $\\phitwoq=180\\degrees$ for $\\tp<\\tlim$ is a clear manifestation of the speed limit set by $\\Jtwo$. In turn, the demonstrated possibility to do so for $\\tp>\\tlim$ (even when overshooting by several sampling points) is an important proof of the viability of the SNZ pulse in practice.\n\nWith these insights, we proceed to tuning SNZ CZ gates for the four transmon pairs, following similar procedures.\nNamely, we use final weak bipolar pulses of total duration $\\toneq=10~\\ns$ to null the single-qubit phases in the frame of microwave drives. Also, since our codeword-based control electronics has a $20~\\ns$ timing grid, and\n$40~\\ns<\\ttotal=\\tp+\\ttwoq+\\toneq<60~\\ns$ for all pairs,  we allocate $60~\\ns$ to every CZ gate. However, some  pair-specific details must be noted.  Owing to the overlap of qubit frequencies between mid-frequency qubits, implementing CZ between $\\QH$ and $\\QMone$ $(\\QMtwo)$ requires parking of $\\QMtwo$ $(\\QMone)$ during the SNZ pulse on $\\QH$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The parking flux pulse is also bipolar, with each half a square pulse lasting $(\\tp+\\ttwoq)/2$. Its amplitude is chosen to downshift the parked qubit by $\\sim 300~\\MHz$, and fine tuned to null its single-qubit phase. For most pairs, we employ the $\\ket{11}$-$\\ket{02}$ interaction, which requires the smallest flux amplitude (reducing the impact of dephasing from flux noise) and does not require crossing any other interaction on the way to and from it. However, for pair $\\QL$-$\\QMone$, we cannot reliably use this interaction as there is a flickering two-level system (TLS) aligned with the $\\QMone$ qubit transition at this amplitude (See\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for chevron measurements showing the flickering nature of this TLS). For this pair, we therefore employ the $\\ket{11}$-$\\ket{20}$ interaction. Using square pulses is a side benefit of SNZ in this case: it minimizes exchange between $\\ket{01}$ and the TLS, $\\ket{11}$ and $\\ket{20}$, and  $\\ket{01}$ and $\\ket{10}$ as their resonances are crossed as suddenly as possible.\n\nParameter     $\\QMone$-$\\QH$      $\\QMtwo$-$\\QH$        $\\QL$-$\\QMone$        $\\QL$-$\\QMtwo$\n\n$\\tlim~(\\ns)$      $32.20$     $29.00$     $40.60$     $35.40$\n\n$\\tp~(\\ns)$      $32.50$     $29.16$     $40.83$     $35.83$\n\n$\\ttwoq~(\\ns)$      2.92     3.75     1.25     1.67\n\n$(\\tp+\\ttwoq)/\\tlim$     $1.10$     $1.13$     $1.04$     $1.06$\n\n$\\ttotal~(\\ns)$     $45.42$     $42.91$     $52.08$     $47.50$\n\nInteraction     $\\ket{11}$-$\\ket{02}$     $\\ket{11}$-$\\ket{02}$     $\\ket{11}$-$\\ket{20}$     $\\ket{11}$-$\\ket{02}$\n\nParked\u00a0qubit     $\\QMtwo$      $\\QMone$     \u2013     \u2013\n\nAvg.\u00a0$\\Fid$ $(\\%)$     $98.89\\pm0.35$     $99.54\\pm0.27$     $93.72\\pm 2.10$     $97.14\\pm 0.72$\n\nAvg.\u00a0$\\Lone$ $(\\%)$     $0.13\\pm0.02$     $0.18\\pm0.04$     $0.78\\pm0.32$     $0.63\\pm0.11$\n\nMax.\u00a0$\\Fid$ $(\\%)$     $99.77\\pm0.23$      $99.93\\pm0.24$      $99.15\\pm1.20$      $98.56\\pm0.70$\n\nMin.\u00a0$\\Lone$ $(\\%)$     $0.07\\pm0.04$     $0.10\\pm0.02$     $0.04\\pm0.08$     $0.41\\pm0.10$\n\nSummary of SNZ CZ pulse parameters and achieved performance for the four transmon pairs. All SNZ CZ gates null single-qubit phases with weak bipolar square pulse of duration $\\toneq=10~\\ns$ immediately following the strong pulse. We allocate $60~\\ns$ to every CZ gate to conform to the $20~\\ns$ timing grid of our control electronics. Gate fidelities and leakage are obtained from 2QIRB keeping the other two qubits in $\\ket{0}$. Statistics (average and standard deviation) are taken from repeated 2QIRB runs (see\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for technical details). The maximum $\\Fid$ and minimum $\\Lone$ quoted are not necessarily from the same run.\n\nTable\u00a01 summarizes the timing parameters and performance attained for the four SNZ CZ gates. The CZ gate fidelity $\\Fid$ and leakage $\\Lone$ are extracted using a 2QIRB protocol modified to quantify leakage\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nFor each pair, we report the best, average and standard deviation of both values based on at least 10 repetitions of the protocol spanning more than $8~\\hours$\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nSeveral observations can be drawn. First, CZ gates involving $\\QH$ perform better on average than those involving $\\QL$. This is likely due to the shorter $\\tlim$ and correspondingly longer time $60~\\ns-\\tp$ spent near the sweetspot. Another possible reason is that the frequency downshifting required of $\\QH$ to interact with $\\QMone$ and $\\QMtwo$  is roughly half that required of the latter to interact with $\\QL$. This reduces the impact of dephasing from flux noise during the pulse. Not surprisingly, performance is worst for the pair $\\QL$-$\\QMone$. Here, the pulse must downshift $\\QMone$ the most in order to reach the distant $\\ket{11}$-$\\ket{20}$ interaction, increasing dephasing from flux noise. Also, there may be residual exchange with the identified TLS and as the $\\ket{11}$-$\\ket{02}$ and $\\ket{01}$-$\\ket{10}$ resonances are crossed. Overall, there is significant variation in the performance metrics during repeated 2QIRB characterization. We believe this reflects the underlying variability of qubit relaxation and dephasing times, which however were not tracked simultaneously. In addition to having the best average performance, pair $\\QMtwo$-$\\QH$ also displays the hero performance based on a single 2QIRB run (Fig.\u00a04). Peaking at $\\Fid=99.93\\pm0.24\\%$, we believe this is the highest CZ fidelity extracted from 2QIRB characterization in a multi-transmon processor.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nBest SNZ CZ gate performance achieved from a single run of 2QIRB.\n(a) Reference and CZ-interleaved return probability $M_0$ to $\\ket{00}$ and (b) population in the computational space $\\chi_1$ as a function of the number of two-qubit Cliffords in the reference curve.\nErrors bars in $\\Fid$ and $\\Lone$ are obtained from the uncertainty of exponential-decay fits.\n\nIn an effort to identify the dominant sources of infidelity $\\Infid=1-\\Fid$ and leakage for SNZ CZ gates, we perform a two-qutrit numerical simulation for pair $\\QMtwo$-$\\QH$ with an error model taking parameters from experiment [Fig.\u00a05]. As in our previous work on conventional NZ\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the simulation incrementally adds: (A) no noise; (B) energy relaxation; (C) Markovian dephasing; (D) dephasing from low-frequency flux noise; and (E) flux-pulse distortion. The experimental inputs for models B, C and D combine measured qubit relaxation time $\\Tone$ at the bias point, and measured echo and Ramsey dephasing times ($\\Ttwoecho$ and $\\Ttwostar$) as a function of qubit frequency. The input to E consists of a final Cryoscope measurement of the flux step response using all real-time filters. The simulation suggests that the main source of $\\Infid$ is Markovian dephasing (as in\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]), while the dominant contribution to $\\Lone$ is low-frequency flux noise. The latter contrasts with Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where simulation identified flux-pulse distortion as the dominant leakage source. We identify two possible reasons for this difference: in the current experiment, the $1/f$ low-frequency flux noise is $\\sim\\!4$ times larger (in units of $\\Phio/\\sqrt{\\Hz}$) and the achieved flux step response is noticeably sharper. Finally, we use the simulation to compare performance of SNZ to conventional NZ CZ. For the latter, we fix $\\ttwoq=0$, $\\toneq=60~\\ns-\\tp$, and use the fast-adiabatic pulse shape and $\\tp=45.83~\\ns$ optimized by simulation. Overall, the error sources contribute very similarly to the error budget for both cases. The marginally higher overall performance found for SNZ is likely due to the increased time spent at the sweetspot during the $60~\\ns$ allocated for each CZ.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nError budgets for infidelity $\\Infid$ (a) and leakage $\\Lone$ (b) obtained by a numerical simulation (as in [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]) of the $\\QMtwo$-$\\QH$ SNZ CZ gate with parameters in Fig.\u00a04 and for a conventional NZ gate with optimized parameters (see text for details). The simulation incrementally adds errors using experimental input parameters for this pair: (A) no noise; (B) relaxation; (C) Markovian dephasing; (D) dephasing from quasistatic flux noise; and (E) flux-pulse distortion.\n\nIn summary, we have proposed and implemented the sudden variant of the NZ pulsing scheme\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] realizing flux-based CZ gates by exploiting transverse coupling between computational and non-computation states.\nSNZ operates at the speed limit of transverse coupling by maximizing the intermediate leakage to the non-computational state.\nThe key advantage of SNZ over conventional NZ is ease of tuneup, owing to the simple structure of error landscapes as a function of pulse parameters.\nWe have demonstrated high-fidelity CZ gates between four transmon pairs in a patch of our 7-transmon processor.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the best fidelity extracted from 2QIRB extends the state of the art.\nControl architectures without a timing grid will additionally benefit from the increased speed of SNZ over conventional NZ by reducing the total gate time and thus the impact of decoherence.\nTaking advantage of the tuning simplicity, we already employ SNZ CZ gates in the Starmon-5 quantum processor publicly available via the QuTech Quantum Inspire platform\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nMoving forwards, the full compatibility of SNZ with our proposed\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] scalable scheme for surface coding makes SNZ our choice for CZ gates as we pursue quantum error correction.\nFinally, the noted straightforward extension of SNZ to arbitrary conditional-phase gates will find immediate application in NISQ applications.\n\nWe thank L.\u00a0Janssen, M.\u00a0Rol, M.\u00a0Sarsby, T.\u00a0Stavenga, and B.\u00a0Tarasinski for experimental assistance, C.\u00a0Eichler and B.\u00a0Terhal for discussions, and G.\u00a0Calusine and W.\u00a0Oliver for providing the travelling-wave parametric amplifier used in the readout amplification chain.

Typically, $/\u223c1.1-1.6$. The strong half pulses are formally parametrized as in~\\cite{Martinis14}. For the purposes of illustration, here we can loosely lump this parametrization as affecting the amplitude ($\u00b1A$) and curvature ($A'$) of the strong half pulses. Immediately following the strong pulse, weak bipolar pulses of duration $$ are applied on both the higher- and lower-frequency transmons with amplitudes $\u00b1C$ and $\u00b1D$, respectively, in order to null the single-qubit phases acquired by each. Typically, $=10\u00a0$.\nIn conventional NZ there is no intermediate idling period between the strong half pulses, so the analogy to the MZI is not exact [Fig.~S1(c)].\nDuring tuneup, one searches the $(A,A')$ space to achieve $=(=\u03c0)$ by only affecting the unitary action of the two beamsplitters.\nBecause for typical $$ conventional NZ produces significant leakage at the first strong pulse, achieving minimal leakage relies on meeting LC2.\nThe structure of the $(A,A')$ and $(A,A')$  landscapes and especially their interrelation are not straightforward, so the search for an $(A,A')$ setting satisfying both PC and LC2 is not easily guided.\nWe point the interested reader to~\\cite{Rol19} for examples.\n\nThe SNZ pulses introduced here [Fig.~S1(b)] differ in two key ways. First, the strong half pulses are replaced by square half pulses each with duration $/2$ as close as possible to $/2$ (as allowed by the AWG sampling period) but not shorter. Second, an intermediate idling period $$ is added to accrue relative phase $\u03d5$ between $|02\u27e9$ and $|11\u27e9$, perfecting the analogy to the MZI [Fig.~S1(d)]. We use the amplitude $\u00b1B$ of the first and last sampling points in $$ and the number of intermediate zero-amplitude points to achieve fine and coarse control of $\u03d5$, respectively. As in conventional NZ, we use weak bipolar pulses on both transmons (also with $=10\u00a0$) to null the single-qubit phases. During tuneup, we search the $(A,B)$ space to achieve $=(=\u03c0)$. As shown in the main text, the SNZ pulse design gives a very simple structure to the $(A,B)$ and $(A,B)$ landscapes. Crucially, the crossing point of leakage valleys satisfying LC2 and LC3 matches $=180$. This simplicity of tuneup is the key advantage of SNZ over conventional NZ.\n\nAnother advantage of SNZ over conventional CZ is the reduced total time $=++$ required to achieve a CZ gate. However, due to the $20\u00a0$ timing grid of our control electronics and the transverse coupling strengths\nin our device, this speedup is insufficient to reduce the total time allocated per CZ gate from $60$ to $40\u00a0$. Nonetheless, in SNZ, the fluxed transmon spends more time at its sweetspot, which reduces the dephasing due to flux noise.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\columnwidth]{FigureS1}\n\\caption{\nComparison of conventional NZ and SNZ pulses for CZ gates.\n(a) Conventional NZ CZ pulses consist of two back-to-back strong half pulses of duration $/2$ each, followed by two weak back-to-back half pulses of duration $/2$ each on the higher-frequency qubit. The amplitude ($\u00b1A$) and curvature ($A'$) of the strong pulses are jointly tuned to set the conditional phasse $$ at minimal leakage $$ , while the amplitude $\u00b1C$ of the weak pulses is used to null the single-qubit phase on the higher-frequency transmon. Weak pulses (amplitude $\u00b1D$) on the lower-frequency qubit (not shown here) are also used to null its single-qubit phase.\n(b) In SNZ, the strong pulses are replaced by square pulses with $$ as close as possible to $$ but not shorter. Also, an intermediate idling period $$ is added to accrue relative phase $\u03d5$ between $|02\u27e9$ and $|11\u27e9$. The amplitude $\u00b1B$ of the first and last sampling points in $$ and the number of intermediate zero-amplitude points provide fine and coarse control of this relative phase, respectively. SNZ CZ gates also use weak bipolar pulses (now square) of total duration $$ to null single-qubit phases.\n(c) The MZI analogy for conventional NZ pulses is incomplete. Each strong half pulse implements a beamsplitter (ideally identical) with scattering parameters affected by $A$ and $A'$. However, there is no possibility to independently control the relative phase in the two arms between the beamsplitters.\n(d) The MZI analogy is exact for SNZ pulse. The scattering at the beamsplitters is controlled by $A$ and the relative phase $\u03d5$ is controlled finely using $B$ and coarsely using $$.\n}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Device and transmon parameters}\n\\label{sec:two}\nOur experimental study focuses on four transmons in a patch of our 7-qubit processor.\nAn optical image of the device, zoomed in to these four transmons, is shown in Fig.~S2.\nTransmons $$ and $$ both connect to $$ and $$ with a dedicated coupling bus resonator for each connection.\nEvery transmon has a dedicated microwave-drive line for single-qubit gating, a flux-control line used for CZ gating, and a dispersively-coupled readout resonator with dedicated Purcell filter~\\cite{Heinsoo18, Bultink20} for readout.\nReadout is performed by frequency multiplexed measurement of a common feedline capacitively connected to all four Purcell filters. Table~S1 provides a summary of measured parameters for the four transmons.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.7\\columnwidth]{FigureS2}\n\\caption{\nOptical image of the device, zoomed in to the four transmons used in this study and with added false color to help identify circuit elements.\nTransmons $$ (red) and $$ (pink) each connect to $$ (green) and $$ (cyan) using dedicated coupling bus resonators for each pair (light orange).\nEach transmon has a flux-control line for two-qubit gating (yellow), a microwave-drive line for single-qubit gating (dark orange), and dispersively-coupled resonator with Purcell filter for readout (purple)~\\cite{Heinsoo18, Bultink20}.

{"prompt": "Explain the 'Introduction' section of the paper.", "completion": "Implementing high-fidelity quantum operations is a central problem in the field of experimental quantum information processing (QIP). Building a universal fault-tolerant quantum computer requires the ability to perform a high-fidelity two quantum-bit (qubit) entangling gate and, while many proposals have been put forth for implementing two-qubit gates, few experimental demonstrations have achieved fidelities near those determined by fault-tolerant analyses\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The cross-resonance (CR) gate\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] has recently been utilized in superconducting circuit systems\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] to achieve a two-qubit CNOT gate with high fidelity exceeding 0.99\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and has been used in small-scale multi-qubit demonstrations of fault-tolerant protocols\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Here we provide a theoretical analysis of the CR gate and outline effective Hamiltonian methods that can be used to obtain a description of the gate dynamics. The techniques developed are directly applicable in realistic systems as shown by the improved experimental calibration and high two-qubit gate fidelity of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nBroadly speaking, the goal of effective Hamiltonian theory is to model some set of complex dynamics on a large system via a more compact Hamiltonian on a set of smaller subsystems or subspaces. Effective Hamiltonian methods have been utilized in various areas of physics and chemistry including nuclear, atomic-molecular, optical, and condensed matter systems. In particular, techniques for the adiabatic elimination of higher energy levels in a system have been widely studied, common examples including the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and Born-Oppenheimer approximation\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Here we restrict attention to effective Hamiltonian constructions based on unitary (canonical) operations that transform the Hamiltonian $H$ on the full Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ into a block-diagonal Hamiltonian $\\Heff$ with the two-block case corresponding to the standard Schrieffer-Wolff transformation.\n\nWe outline the perturbative construction of an effective Hamiltonian where the desired block-diagonal form is enforced at each order. The advantage of the perturbative construction lies in obtaining analytical expressions for components of $\\Heff$ that hold in the weak perturbation limit. The second construction is based on an exact multi-block-diagonalization technique\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] which finds the block-diagonal Hamiltonian that is closest to the true Hamiltonian under the principle of least action. This method has the advantage of being valid in the strong drive regime however it is not possible to compute general analytic expressions for the Hamiltonian components except in simple cases such as the basic two-qubit model. These methods are applied to obtain an effective model for the CR gate Hamiltonian in the two-qubit model as well as when higher levels are included. As a concrete example we use the parameters of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and find good agreement between the perturbative and exact multi-block diagonalization approaches in the weak-drive limit with higher levels included. However a discrepancy is found between the theory and experiment since Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] finds the presence of extra unwanted terms in the Hamiltonian. We propose classical cross-talk between the two transmons from the CR drive as a potential source for this discrepancy and extend the analysis to include this effect. After doing so we find very good agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental results of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. First in Sec.\u00a0<ref> we describe the starting Hamiltonian for the analysis which consists of two transmons dispersively coupled to a resonator. We outline a method to find an effective block-diagonal Hamiltonian for the two transmon-resonator system which when projected onto the zero-excitation subspace of the resonator provides an effective Hamiltonian for the two transmon system alone. Next in Sec.\u00a0<ref> we model the transmons as ideal qubits and find an analytic expression for the effective CR Hamiltonian under the principle of least action. In Sec.\u00a0<ref> we model the transmons as Duffing oscillators and find perturbative expressions that hold in the weak-drive limit. We also perform a numerical analysis of the exact block-diagonalization technique using the parameters of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In Sec.\u00a0<ref> we analyze classical cross-talk occurring from the CR drive to model the results of Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For clarity of the presentation the mathematical methods and details of effective Hamiltonian theory are contained in the appendix (Sec.\u00a0<ref>) with the main text focused mainly on discussion of the application of the methods to the CR gate."}
{"prompt": "Explain the 'Two-qubit gate calibration' section of the paper.", "completion": "Prior to a fine calibration of our CZ gate, we would first calibrate single-qubit gates (appendix:single_qubit) and the relative drive parameters (appendix:microwave_crosstalk). Specifically, when calibrating the CZ gate, we increased the pulse width of the single-qubit gates to 50ns, trading off single-qubit gate fidelities so that coherent errors would not skew our tomography pulses. We also increased the padding between pulses to 10ns because computational state lifetimes have only a secondary effect on our CZ gate fidelities.\n\nFor a given pulse width and gate transition, the remaining four parameters to be calibrated are the drive frequency, overall drive amplitude, and the single-qubit phase accumulations during our gate interaction. After performing spectroscopy of the transition in interest, we iteratively fine-tuned the drive amplitude and frequency. The drive amplitude was calibrated by performing a simple Rabi oscillation and minimizing the leakage [fig:sup_2qb_cala, d]. According to our error budget outlined in appendix:error, a single CZ pulse yields a sufficiently precise calibration. The drive frequency was calibrated by performing a Ramsey-like measurement on qubit 1 to measure its phase accrual after a pulse-train of CZ gates, depending on whether or not qubit 2 started in\u00a0$\\ket{0}$ or\u00a0$\\ket{1}$ [fig:sup_2qb_calb, e]. The difference in this phase accrual was tuned to be\u00a0$180^\\circ$, though we note that controlled-phase gates of variable angles could also be achieved. Since adjusting the drive frequency slightly changes the amplitude corresponding to a single period and vice-versa, we alternately performed these two calibrations three times in total. In practice, we found this was sufficiently accurate and much faster than performing a two-dimensional calibration for both parameters simultaneously. Finally, once the CZ interaction was properly tuned, we measured the single-qubit phase accumulation during the CZ interaction using the same Ramsey-like measurement [fig:sup_2qb_calc, f]. These\u00a0$Z$-rotations were corrected for in software through virtual-$Z$ gates. We illustrate the complete flowchart of this calibration in fig:sup_2qb_calg.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nCZ Gate calibration procedure. a-c Pulse sequences for d-f respectively.

When recalibrating the system for small flux drifts or periodic check-ins, we found it unnecessary to recalibrate the relative drive amplitude or phase.\n\nTo benchmark our CZ gate, we performed two-qubit interleaved randomized benchmarking, in which Clifford gates were sampled from the two-qubit Clifford group, generated by\u00a0${\\{I,\\, \\pm X,\\, \\pm Y,\\, \\pm X_{\\pi/2},\\, \\pm Y_{\\pi/2},\\, \\text{CZ}\\}}$. Our specific decomposition results in 8.25 single-qubit gates and 1.5 CZ gates per Clifford.\n\nInterleaved randomized benchmarking consists of two steps: (1) performing standard randomized benchmarking, in which we extract the depolarizing parameter by measuring sequence fidelity with initial state\u00a0$\\ket{00}$ and fitting to the decay\u00a0${p_{00} = A p^m + B}$. (2) Performing the same standard randomization benchmarking sequence, except an additional CZ gate is inserted between each pair of Cliffords, and the final recovery gate is modified accordingly. Fitting this decay gives\u00a0$p_\\text{int}$, the interleaved depolarizing parameter. By comparing the relative decays between the two steps, the average CZ gate fidelity is extracted as\n$$\n\nF_\\text{CZ} = 1 - (d - 1)(1 - p_\\text{int}/p)/d,\n\n$$\nand its uncertainty is once again represented as a standard error, following the procedure of appendix:single_qubit."}

Early demonstrations of quantum algorithms in superconducting circuits focused on small, non-QEC versions of well-known quantum algorithms such as Deutsch-Jozsa [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and Shor [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], as well as demonstrations of surface code primitives (discussed in Sec.\u00a0<ref>).\n\nNISQ algorithms may be thought of as `hardware-informed' quantum algorithms, i.e. the algorithms can be developed for a specific qubit connectivity to avoid certain low-fidelity qubits in the processor or hard-to-implement quantum gates. NISQ algorithms do not rely on the full support of quantum error correction, but instead optimize the algorithm fidelity based on an expectation of a lossy quantum system.  In particular, the most promising NISQ algorithms take hybrid classical-quantum approaches: they rely on classical computers and algorithms to implement the bulk of the necessary calculations, and tap the quantum processor only for the portions of the algorithm that cannot be performed efficiently on a classical processor. By delegating work to a classical processor, these algorithms reduce the circuit depth[]\nCircuit depthThe number of time-steps required to run a given quantum algorithm.

The form of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) can be understood by noting that $S_{21}$ is real when $\\omega=\\delta \\omega+\\omega_0$ (to within a phase rotation of $1+\\hat{\\epsilon}$).\n\nHere we stress that Eqs.\u00a0(<ref>-<ref>) are equivalent representations of the asymmetric line shape, each highlighting a different interpretation of the asymmetry. In Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) the asymmetry is quantified by $\\mathbf{Im}\\left\\{\\hat{Q}_e^{-1} \\right\\}$ and one can think of the asymmetry as coming from a complex loading of the resonator. In Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) the asymmetry is quantified by $\\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the rotation angle of the resonance circle around the off-resonance point (see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)). And finally in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) the asymmetry is quantified by $\\delta \\omega$, where $\\delta\\omega=\\omega_1-\\omega_0$ is the frequency shift of the in-phase point on the resonance circle from $\\omega_0$ to $\\omega_1$ (see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)). There of course exists a simple one-to-one mapping between the three notations:\n$$\n\n\\phi=\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{Im}\\{\\hat{Q}_e^{-1}\\}}{\\mathbf{Re}\\{\\hat{Q}_e^{-1}\\}}\\right)=\\arctan\\left(2Q\\frac{\\delta\\omega}{\\omega_0}\\right).\n\\label{eq:mapping}\n\n$$\n\nOne method that has been used [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] to extract internal quality factors simply accounts for the asymmetry by adding an empirical $\\phi$ rotation and incorrectly substitutes $\\left|\\hat{Q}_e^{-1}\\right|$ for $Q_e^{-1}$ by defining\n$$\n\n\\frac{1}{Q_{i,\\ \\phi RM}}=\\frac{1}{Q}-\\left|\\frac1{\\hat{Q}_e}\\right|.\n\\label{eq:Qi_wrong}\n\n$$\nThis method accounts for the asymmetric line shape phenomenologically by adding the rotation, $\\phi$, without accounting for its origin and its impact on the interpretation of $Q_i$. It corresponds to rotating the resonance circle back an angle $\\phi$, thereby putting $\\omega_0$ on the in-phase axis. This is the $\\phi$ rotation method ($\\phi$RM), and the rotation of the $\\phi$RM can best be seen by examining the difference between Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(a) and Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(b)($\\bigtriangleup$). However, simply rotating the resonance circle by angle $\\phi$ does not take into account the fact that the asymmetry has also caused the circle to grow by a factor of $1/\\cos(\\phi)$, assuming the circle has been normalized to full transmission off resonance $(S_{21}(\\omega<<\\omega_0)=S_{21}(\\omega>>\\omega_0)=1)$. We have shown here that instead one has\n$$\n\n\\frac{1}{Q_{i,\\ DCM}}=\\frac{1}{Q}-\\frac{1}{Q_e}.\n\\label{eq:Qi_right}\n\n$$\nWe call this the Diameter Correction Method (DCM) because in addition to rotating the circle by the asymmetry angle, $\\phi$, it also corrects the diameter by accounting for the complex $Q_e$. This can be seen by examining the difference between Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(a) and Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle)(b)($\\square$). Another interpretation of this result is that the quantity that remains constant in the asymmetry transformation is not the diameter of the resonance circle, as the $\\phi$RM assumes, but rather the distance between the in-phase axis intercepts, shown in bold in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:circle). That invariant length is the diameter of the circle for a symmetric resonance and becomes a chord of the circle as asymmetry is added, but remains equal to $Q/Q_e$, while the diameter grows as $Q/|\\hat{Q}_e|$.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Cross-entropy benchmarking' section of the paper.", "completion": "The final protocol we discuss in this tutorial is XEB [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nXEB gained importance recently:\nit was used in order to experimentally collect evidence that a quantum computer can perform a task that basically no existing classical computer can solve in a reasonable amount of time [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] XEB is performed in two distinct variants:\none variant aims at extracting fidelity measures averaged over random sequences of individual gates.\nThis protocol can be regarded as a special case of the character randomized benchmarking protocol [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\nthat we have touched upon in Section\u00a0<ref>.\nThe second variant aims at certifying the correct sampling from the measurement output distribution of a single specific circuit.\nThis second variant of XEB is the focus of this section.\nIt can be seen as an instance of a certification protocol on the application layer of a digital quantum computer.\nIn consequence, it is commonly also referred to as a verification protocol for sampling tasks.\nBut the application, sampling from a distribution encoded in a quantum circuit,\nis deliberately chosen very close to the physical layer.\n\nXEB was proposed as a protocol in the context of demonstrating quantum supremacy.\nExperimentally demonstrating that a quantum computer can outperform current classical computers in some task is regarded as one of the\nmayor milestones in developing quantum computing technologies.\nThe accuracy of the quantum operations and numbers of qubits of today's\ndevices do not permit instances of interesting quantum algorithms\nthat solve problems without known efficient algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm for integer factorization,\nat least not problem instances that come even close to being troublesome for a classical computer [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThis motivated the proposal of demonstrating quantum supremacy in\nthe task of generating samples from a probability distribution that is specified as the measurement distribution of a quantum circuit.\nThis is a task that a quantum computer solves very naturally even though it might not be of any practical use [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nAt the same time one can prove that certain random ensembles of quantum circuits yield probability distributions that can not be efficiently sampled from on a classical computer [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nBesides establishing evidence for the hardness of solving the sampling task on a classical computer,\na crucial ingredient in demonstrating\nquantum supremacy\nis a certification protocol that\nguarantees that one has implemented the correct distribution.\n\nThe approach taken in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is to\nbuild trust in the correct functioning of the device for\ncircuits that are still amenable to calculating a couple of outcome probabilities on a classical super-computer.\nTo this end, the XEB protocol was used.\nThe measures that XEB tries to estimate are the cross-entropy difference and its variant the cross-entropy fidelity.\n\nCross-entropy and cross-entropy fidelity\n\nIn the context of certifying a sampling task it is natural to directly consider\nmeasures of quality that compare two probability densities describing the measurement outcomes.\nWhile the measures we have studied in this tutorial so far are concerned with the physical layer,\nmeasures directly comparing two probabilities can be regarded as measures on the application layer.\n\nFor a quantum circuit $U$ acting on $n$ qubits, we denote its measurement probability mass function in a basis $\\{\\ket x\\}_{x \\in [d]}$ after preparing a fixed initial state $\\ket \\psi$ by $p_U: [d] \\to [0,1]$ with\n$$\n\\label{eq:def:measdist}\np_U(x) = \\left|\\sandwich x U \\psi \\right|^2.\n\n$$\n\nA well-known statistical measure [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] to relate two\nprobability mass functions $q, p: [d] \\to [0,1]$ is the cross-entropy\n$$\n\nH_X(q,p) = -

1 ).\n\n$$\n\nBefore discussing the XEB protocol to estimate $H_X$ and $F_X$ let us illuminate the\nmotivation of $F_X$ in the context of certifying sampling tasks.\n\nFirst, the cross-entropy fidelity can be regarded as a linear proxy to the cross-entropy difference\nand, as such, as a simpler version of it.\nThe shift of minus one in the definition of $F_X$ is chosen such that\n$F_X(p_\\text{uni}, p) = 0$ for $p_\\text{uni}$ the uniform density and any probability density $p$.\nIf $p_U$ is assumed to be of Porter-Thomas shape\none can calculate that $F_X(p_U, p_U) = 1$.\nThis motivates the expectation that performing high in cross-entropy fidelity indicates successfully\nsolving the sampling task for typical random circuits $U$.\n\nNote that if $U$ is drawn at random from a unitary $2$-design $\\mu$,\nwe can reproduce the Porter-Thomas value of $F_X(p_U, p_U)$ in expectation over $U$ using Lemma\u00a0<ref>:\nwe first calculate\n$$\n\\nonumber\n\\EE_{U\\sim \\mu}\\left[p^2_U(x) \\right] %\n&= \\EE_{U\\sim \\mu}\\myleft[ |\\sandwich x U \\psi|^4\\myright]\n\\\\\\nonumber\n&= {\\bra x}^{\\otimes 2} \\,\n\\EE_{U\\sim \\mu}\n\\myleft[ (U \\ketbra\\psi\\psi U^\\dagger)^{\\otimes 2} \\myright]\n{\\ket x}^{\\otimes 2}\n\\\\\\nonumber\n&= \\frac{{\\bra x}^{\\otimes 2} P_{\\sym^2} {\\ket x}^{\\otimes 2}}{\\Tr(P_{\\sym^2})} \\\\\n&= \\frac2{d(d+1)}\n\\label{eq:xeb:fx:exp}\n\n$$\nande hence find that\n$$\n%\n\\begin{split}%\n\\EE_{U\\sim \\mu} [F_X(p_U, p_U) ]\n&= \\sum_{x \\in [d]} d\\, \\EE_{U\\sim \\mu}\\myleft[p^2_U(x)\\myright] -

1$ for the cross-entropy fidelity and $f(p) = f_H(p) = -\\ln(p)$ for the cross-entropy.\nThis observation suggests a simple protocol, akin to importance sampling (Section\u00a0<ref>), for empirically estimating both quantities if we have access to samples of one of the distributions.\n\n[label=protocol:xeb]XEB [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\nLet $U$ be a description of a quantum circuit, $\\ket{\\psi} \\in \\CC^d$ be an initial states and $\\mathcal B = \\{\\ket x\\}_{x \\in [d]}$ an orthonormal basis of $\\CC^d$.\n\n*  Prepare $U\\ket{\\psi}$ on a quantum computer and measure in the basis $\\mathcal B$ a number of $m$ times to collect the measurement outcomes $\\mathcal O = (\\tilde x_1,\\ldots, \\tilde x_m) \\in [d]^m$.\n\n*  Calculate on a classical computer for each $\\tilde x \\in \\mathcal O$ the value of $p_U(\\tilde x)$.\n\n*  Return the estimator\n$$\n\n\\hat E_f = \\frac1{|\\mathcal O|}\\sum_{\\tilde x \\in \\mathcal O} f(p_U(\\tilde x)),\n\n$$\nwhere $f$ is $f_F$ or $f_H$ for estimating the cross-entropy fidelity or cross-entropy, respectively.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that step\u00a0<ref>\nrequires that a classical computer can compute individual probabilities of the circuit.\nFor this reason, XEB cannot be used directly for circuits that are not classically simulable.\nInstead, one can investigate the performance on restricted subclasses of circuits that are still tractable on a\npowerful classical computer and from these results extrapolate the performance in the regime where one expects quantum\nsupremacy.\n\nIf we assume that the target distribution $p_U$ is defined using a Haar-randomly drawn unitary $U$, we can derive a guarantee for Protocol\u00a0<ref> for\nthe linear cross-entropy using the techniques that we presented in this tutorial.\nSuch a guarantee was derived by Hangleiter\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n[label=thm:XEBsampling]Linear XEB sampling complexity [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\nLet $U \\in \\U(d)$ be a Haar random unitary, $\\ket{\\psi}\\in \\CC^d$ and $\\mathcal B = \\{\\ket x\\}_{x=1}^d \\subset \\CC^d$ an orthonormal basis.

The estimator $\\hat E_f$ is the sum of $m$ i.i.d. random variables $f(p_U(\\tilde x))$.\nBy the form (<ref>) it is clear that $\\hat E_f$ is an unbiased estimator for $E_f$.\nThe estimator $\\hat E_f$ is the sum  of $m$ i.i.d. random variables $f(p_U(\\tilde x))$.\nUsing Lemma\u00a0<ref> $p_U(x) \\leq b \\coloneqq \\frac \\e d \\ln\\myleft(\\frac{2d}{\\delta}\\myright)$  with probability $1 - \\delta / 2$.\nThus, with the same probability, the random variable $f(p_U(\\tilde x))$, with $f = f_F$ as defined below (<ref>), is bounded by $db - 1 = \\e \\ln(2d /\\delta)$.\nNow Hoeffding's inequality (<ref>), with failure probability $\\delta / 2$ yields the statement.\n\nFollowing the same strategy, one can also derive a sampling complexity in\n$\\LandauO\\bigl(\\epsilon^{-2}\\ln^2(d)\\ln(1/\\delta)\\bigr)$\nfor estimating the cross-entropy $H_X(\\tilde p_U, p_U)$ by Protocol\u00a0<ref> [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nSince the cross-entropy $f(p_U(\\tilde x))$ involves the logarithm, the\nupper bound on the range of $p_U$ of Lemma\u00a0<ref> is no longer sufficient to ensure boundedness of the random variables that enter the estimator.\nIn addition, one needs a lower bound on the range of $p_U$.\nThis is not possible with our bounds on the moments.\nInstead, one has to explicitly calculate the tail distribution (<ref>).\n\nFrom an estimate of the cross-entropy one can calculate an estimate of the cross-entropy difference by shifting with $H_X(p_\\text{uni}, p_U)$.\nIf the ideal circuit is sufficiently close to a Haar-random unitary, one can analytically calculate $H_X(p_\\text{uni}, p_U)$.\nAlternatively, taking the average of the values calculated in step\u00a0<ref> provides a numerical estimate for $H_X(p_\\mathrm{uni}, p_U)$.\n\nUltimately, theoretical results for the hardness of sampling tasks require closeness of the probability mass functions\nin TV distance or TV norm\n$$\n\n\\norm{q -

A refined notion of the heavy outcome generation test is the BOG test proposed in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nNote that these protocols still require an efficient simulation of the quantum circuit on another computing device.\nOne approach to overcome this bottleneck is to run the quantum circuit as part of a larger circuit that includes so-called traps, subcircuits that can be efficiently simulated [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nNaturally, approaches for quantum state and processes certification can also be used to verify a sampling task under a various assumptions.\n\nIt is an ongoing endeavor to develop classical strategies for spoofing verification protocols for quantum supremacy with successes reported e.g. in Refs.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and for collecting evidence for the hardness of classical spoofing [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nAn extensive, recent overview over verification and certification methods in the context of quantum supremacy can be found in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nOur present work builds on countless insightful discussions\non the topic of quantum system characterization and beyond\nwith many friends and colleagues over the last years.\n\nAmong those are a couple that we explicitly thank for valuable support while drafting this tutorial.\nWe thank Raphael Brieger for comments on the presentation of the lecture notes preceding this tutorial.\nWe are grateful to Dominik Hangleiter for countless exciting and enlightening discussions on\nvarious topics of the tutorial, especially on the anatomy of certification protocols, DFE and cross-entropy benchmarking.\nWe are grateful to him for graciously providing a draft of his thesis \u2014a valuable resource on the certification of quantum supremacy\u2014 and helpful comments on the tutorial.\nWe thank Richard Kueng for explanations and discussions on SFE and quantum channels as well as valuable feedback on the tutorial.\nI.R. thanks Jonas Helsen, Emilio Onorati, Albert Werner, and Jens Eisert for valuable and insightful discussions on RB,\nJonas Haferkamp, Markus Heinrich, Felipe Montealegre-Mora and David Gross for discussions on\nSchur-Weyl duality, Yi-Kai Liu for discussions on DFE and RB.\nFurthermore, the section on the anatomy of certification protocols\nbuilds on many enjoyable conversations with Nathan Walk.\nWe are grateful to Susane Calegari for contribution to the illustrations and valuable feedback on the draft.\nThe work of I.R. has been funded by the DFG (EI 519/9-1, EI 519/14-1, and CRC 183).\nThe work by M.K. is supported by\nthe Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) via the Emmy Noether grant 441423094.\n\nACRONYMS\n[POVM].5NISQnoisy and intermediate scale quantumPOVMpositive operator valued measurePVMprojector-valued measureCPcompletely positiveCPTcompletely positive and trace preservingDFEdirect fidelity estimationMUBsmutually unbiased basesSICsymmetric, informationally completeSFEshadow fidelity estimationRBrandomized benchmarkingXEBcross-entropy benchmarkingSPAMstate preparation and measurementTVtotal variationHOGheavy outcome generationBOGbinned outcome generation./myapsrev4-2"}

[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nFor $\\X \\in \\M(\\H)$ the unitarity is defined as\n$$\n\nu(\\X) = \\frac d{d-1} \\agf(\\X', \\X'),\n\n$$\nwhere $d = \\dim \\H$ and $\\X' \\in \\M(\\H)$ is defined by\n$$\n\n\\X'(A) = \\X(A) - \\Tr[\\X(A)] \\1/\\sqrt{d}\\, .\n\n$$\nOne can straightforwardly check that $u(\\mc U) = 1$ for every unitary channel $\\mc U$.\nOn the other hand, in Refs.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] a lower-bound on $u$ in terms of the infidelity $r$ was derived\nfor trace-decreasing maps.\nFor $\\X \\in \\M(\\H)$, $d \\coloneqq \\dim(\\H)$, and $\\Tr(\\X(\\1)) \\leq \\Tr(\\1)$ it holds that\n$$\n\\label{eq:def:umin}\nu(\\X) \\geq u_\\text{min} =\\left(1 - \\frac{d}{d-1}\\, r(\\X) \\right)^2 \\, .\n\n$$\n\nKueng et al.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] established that quantum channels saturating this lower bound exhibit a\nlinear scaling of the diamond norm distance in terms of the infidelity.\n\n[label=thm:RiKbound]Worst-case bound for incoherent channels [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\nLet $\\X \\in \\CPT(\\H)$ be unital.\nThen\n$\\dnorm{\\id - \\X} \\in \\LandauO(r(\\X))$ if $u(\\X) = u_\\text{min} + \\LandauO(r^2(\\X))$ with $u_\\text{min}$ defined in (<ref>).\n\nThe result implies that the infidelity is indeed particularly sensitive to depolarizing noise.\nWe leave it with this qualitative statement and refer to Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for a quantitative\nstatement.

Fabrication of this sample includes three main steps: (1) aluminum deposition onto a $c$-plane sapphire substrate followed by photolithography and inductively coupled-plasma etching to define all the base wiring and resonators; (2) two photolithography processes, aluminum deposition, and wet etching to construct airbridges\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]; (3) e-beam lithography with two layer e-beam resists and double-angle aluminum deposition to make Josephson junctions. Airbridges are mainly used to connect segments of ground planes in order to reduce parasitic slotline modes. We also apply flux trapping holes (square holes of side length of 2\u00a0$\\mu$m) to reduce magnetic vortices loss\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic electrical circuit of the device.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nMeasurement setup. Our measurement circuit contains three AWGs (two Tek5014C and one Tek70002A), three signal generators, and other microwave components. The XY control pulses are generated from a signal generator modulated by the AWG. Flux pulses are generated directly from Tek5014C (for $Q_1$) and Tek70002A (for $Q_2$ and the coupler). Readout signal is amplified by a JPA at the base, a high-electron-mobility-transistor (HEMT) amplifier at 4K and two room-temperature amplifiers, and finally down-converted and digitized by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC).\n\nThe full parameters of the qubits and the coupler are shown in Table\u00a0<ref> with the coupling capacitances defined in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:DeviceSchematic). Our sample is measured in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature about 20\u00a0mK, and the details of our measurement circuit are shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:experimentsetup). We use two XY control lines to manipulate the qubit states, three flux lines to modify the qubit and the coupler frequencies, and one input-output line to readout both qubits simultaneously. The XY control pulses are generated from a signal generator modulated by a four-channel arbitrary waveform generator (AWG), while flux pulses are directly generated from AWGs. Finally, a broadband Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA)\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is used for high-fidelity simultaneous single-shot readout.\n\nDerivative removal adiabatic gate (DRAG)\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] pulse is used for single qubit rotation to reduce the leakage to higher qubit levels. Due to thermal population of the qubits and the coupler, and nonperfect separation of the ground and excited states for each qubit, the qubit readout results are reconstructed by using Bayes' rule with a calibration matrix:\n\n${\\rm M}_{{\\rm B}j}$=\n$\\left(\\begin{tabular}{cc}\n$F_gj$ & $1-F_ej$\\\\\n$1-F_gj$ & $F_ej$\\\\\n\\end{tabular}\\right)$\n,\n\nwhere ${\\rm F}_{{\\rm g}j}$ and ${\\rm F}_{{\\rm e}j}$ are the readout fidelity for the $j$-th ($j=1,2$) qubit in the initial steady state without and with a following $\\pi$ rotation respectively.

A secondary device (Device B) with slightly different Hamiltonian parameters supports the reliability of our architecture. Points with fidelity below 98.9\n\nGate driving\nWe activated the gate interaction associated with each transition by simultaneously applying a charge drive to each fluxonium [fig:map_specb inset].\nThese drives were chosen to have equal amplitude, with a relative phase between them to maximize constructive interference at the intended transition.\nWe found that using two constructive drives was a convenient method for reducing the total applied power for a given Rabi rate, resulting in a reduced ac-Stark shift from off-resonant transitions.\nIn severe cases, a large ac-Stark shift could prevent the realization of a 180$^\\circ$ conditional phase and increase leakage into non-computational states.\nAn alternative approach exists to tune the relative phase and amplitude of the two drives to result in complete destructive interference of the nearest leakage transition (see appendix:microwave_crosstalk).\nWhile theoretically we expect the relative phase and amplitude to be important for reducing leakage, we found that as long as a\u00a0$180^\\circ$ conditional phase was attainable, the CZ gate fidelity was relatively insensitive to these two parameters.\nfig:map_specb shows the familiar Rabi chevrons when the transition was driven as a function of frequency; in experimental practice, our two-qubit gate is quite similar to driving single-qubit Rabi oscillations.\n\nGate calibration and characterization\nFor a given transition and pulse duration, there are four critical parameters associated with the CZ gate to calibrate: (1) the overall drive amplitude of the two phase-locked drives to ensure a single-period oscillation, (2) the drive frequency to ensure a\u00a0$180^\\circ$ conditional phase accumulation, and (3-4) the single-qubit phases accumulated on each fluxonium during the gate.\nThese single-qubit phase corrections can be conveniently implemented through virtual-Z gates by adjusting the phases of subsequent single-qubit gates\u00a0[McKay, David C, Wood, Christopher J, Sheldon, Sarah, Chow, Jerry M, Gambetta, Jay M, \"Efficient Z gates for quantum computing\", 2017].\nAfter calibration, we extract the gate fidelity by performing Clifford interleaved randomized benchmarking, averaging over 20 different randomizations\u00a0[C\u00f3rcoles, Antonio D, Gambetta, Jay M, Chow, Jerry M, Smolin, John A, Ware, Matthew, Strand, Joel, Plourde, Britton LT, Steffen, Matthias, \"Process verification of two-qubit quantum gates by randomized benchmarking\", 2013] [Magesan, Easwar, Gambetta, Jay M, Johnson, Blake R, Ryan, Colm A, Chow, Jerry M, Merkel, Seth T, Da Silva, Marcus P, Keefe, George A, Rothwell, Mary B, Ohki, Thomas A, others, \"Efficient measurement of quantum gate error by interleaved randomized benchmarking\", 2012] [Barends, Rami, Kelly, Julian, Megrant, Anthony, Veitia, Andrzej, Sank, Daniel, Jeffrey, Evan, White, Ted C, Mutus, Josh, Fowler, Austin G, Campbell, Brooks, others, \"Superconducting quantum circuits at the surface code threshold for fault tolerance\", 2014].\nSimilar to our single-qubit Clifford decomposition, we generated the two-qubit Clifford group with the gate set\n${\\{I,\\, \\pm X,\\, \\pm Y,\\, \\pm X_{\\pi/2},\\, \\pm Y_{\\pi/2},\\, \\text{CZ}\\}}$, yielding an average of 8.25 single-qubit gates and 1.5 CZ gates per Clifford.\nA more detailed gate calibration and characterization description can be found in appendix:two_qubit.\n\nGate vs. Flux\nThe FTF approach offers a potential solution to frequency-crowding by allowing for an adjustable gate operation frequency.\nTo demonstrate this frequency-flexibility in our device, we linearly sampled the coupler flux\u00a0$\\Phi_\\text{ext,c}$ at 21 values between\u00a0$\\SI{0.5}{\\Phi_0}$ and\u00a0$\\SI{1}{\\Phi_0}$ and calibrated a CZ gate across all three transitions in fig:map_speca while maintaining a constant 100ns pulse length [fig:map_specc].\nEach data point in fig:map_specc represents a fully automated re-calibration of all single- and two-qubit gate parameters without manual fine-tuning.\nMissing points indicate either failed calibrations or fidelities lower than\u00a0$98.9\\%$, which may be caused by TLS or nearly resonant unwanted transitions (see appendix:rb_vs_flux for further details).\nWhile these fidelities remain unoptimized over the pulse width, they indicate the ease and robustness of the tuneup, as well as the accessibility of state-of-the-art gate fidelities at a variety of drive frequencies.\nWe further emphasize this by including fidelities from Device B, a second fully characterized device with similar performance. While designed to be nominally identical, the non-computational states in Device B differ by up to 300MHz from Device A, with no significant detriment to the gate fidelities (see appendix:other_device for additional characterization of Device B).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nOptimizing the CZ gate fidelity via reinforcement learning. a Gate fidelities as a function of the width of the cosine pulse envelope, averaged over 20 randomizations.

The purple circle at 28 Cliffords indicates the sequence length used for learning. All uncertainties in this figure correspond to the standard error of the mean.\n\nRB vs pulse width\nTo investigate the trade-off between coherent and incoherent error, we characterized the gate fidelity as a function of the pulse width.\nIn general, all fidelities in fig:map_specc may be improved by optimizing over this pulse width, with our highest fidelity gates using the\u00a0${\\ket{101}\\leftrightarrow \\ket{102}}$ transition at\u00a0$\\Phi_\\text{ext,c} = 0.575 \\Phi_0$ [fig:fidelitiesa].\nAt the observed optimal gate time of 85ns for this transition, we benchmarked a CZ fidelity of\u00a0${99.89\\%\\pm0.02\\%}$.\nFor longer gate durations, the gate error is dominated by the lifetime of the driven non-computational state, measured to be around 10s at this transition and, in general, varied from\u00a0$5-\\SI{20}{\\micro s}$ across all transitions in fig:map_speca.\nThe coherence times of the computational states also reduce the fidelity, but for our devices this error is negligible compared to the\u00a0$T_1$ of the non-computational state (see appendix:error for an analytic error model of this gate process).\nAt shorter gate lengths, coherent leakage into non-computational levels dominates the error, but due to the extreme degree of hybridization of the non-computational states and their subpar readout, we were not able to experimentally measure the location of the leaked population.\n\nReinforcement Learning\nTo further improve the gate fidelity, we deployed a model-free reinforcement learning agent\u00a0[John Schulman and\nFilip Wolski and\nPrafulla Dhariwal and\nAlec Radford and\nOleg Klimov, \"Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms\", 2017] [An, Zheng, Zhou, DL, \"Deep reinforcement learning for quantum gate control\", 2019] [Niu, Murphy Yuezhen, Boixo, Sergio, Smelyanskiy, Vadim N, Neven, Hartmut, \"Universal quantum control through deep reinforcement learning\", 2019] [Wang, Zhikang T., Ashida, Yuto, Ueda, Masahito, \"Deep Reinforcement Learning Control of Quantum Cartpoles\", 2020], closely following the protocol described by Sivak et al.\u00a0[Sivak, V. V., Eickbusch, A., Liu, H., Royer, B., Tsioutsios, I., Devoret, M. H., \"Model-Free Quantum Control with Reinforcement Learning\", 2022].\nWhile reinforcement learning could not mitigate the incoherent errors dominating the gate at longer pulse widths, at shorter gate times ($<$70ns) we found that it did offer an improvement via fine adjustments of the pulse parameters.\nTo train the agent, we first seeded it with a physics-based pulse calibration with a pulse width of 60ns; our physics-based calibration failed at gate times less than this.\nThen, with a fixed CZ pulse width of 50ns, the agent was trained to maximize the sequence fidelity of interleaved randomized benchmarking at 28 Cliffords with a fixed random seed by optimizing the pulse shape and virtual-Z gates\u00a0[fig:fidelitiesb].\nAfter each round of training, the optimized pulse was repeatedly evaluated by\nperforming interleaved randomized benchmarking over 70 total Clifford sequences\u00a0[fig:fidelitiesc].\nTraining was then repeated using the optimized pulse shape from the previous training round as the seed for the next.\nFor the training run shown in\u00a0fig:fidelitiesc, the fidelity peaked after the second round of training (orange points), with a time-averaged value of $99.922\\pm0.009\\%$.\nA Wilcoxon signed-rank test gives 97\nAs the run progressed, the average fidelity was observed to degrade.\nWe hypothesize that this was due to system drifts beyond what the agent was able to mitigate.\n\nIn the data shown in fig:fidelitiesb-e, the agent was given full control of the $I$ and $Q$ quadratures of the pulse envelope as well as the single-qubit virtual-Z rotation angles.\n$I(t)$ and $Q(t)$ were discretized into six points equally spaced in time [fig:fidelitiesd] with a cubic interpolation determining the remaining points.\nPerhaps the most distinctive feature of the learned pulse is the shape of $Q(t)$: while the agent was seeded with $Q(t) = 0$, the learned pulse shape displays a distinct oscillation in $Q(t)$.\nAlthough we do not fully understand the origin of this oscillation, some intuition may be gained by examining the Fourier transform of the pulse shape [fig:fidelitiesd inset].\nIn the frequency domain, the oscillation in $Q(t)$ results in a distinct asymmetry of the pulse shape: at positive detunings from the carrier frequency, the spectral weight is suppressed, and vice versa for negative detunings.\nWe hypothesize that this learned pulse asymmetry mitigates the effects of the nearest undesired transition, which is detuned by $\\sim$+65MHz at this bias point.\nHowever, we also note that attempts to mitigate the effects of this undesired transition using more established pulse shaping techniques did not improve the gate fidelity\u00a0[Motzoi, F., Gambetta, J.

cavities\nwith capacitive and inductive coupling\n\nkamigait@riken.jp\nRIKEN Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science\n\n2-1 Hirosawa, Wako-shi, Saitama 351-0198, Japan\n\nThe external-Q factor of a resonant mode of a cavity represents the strength of the\nelectromagnetic coupling between this resonant mode and the transmission mode of a waveguide coupled to the cavity.\nIn this paper, we derive formulas to explicitly give the external Q of the cavities coupled with the waveguide\nthrough capacitive and inductive coupling.\nThe derivation is based on the classical method that uses the reflection coefficient to estimate the coupling strength.\nAlthough the external Q is evaluated via three-dimensional computer simulations currently,\nthese formulas may be useful for making speculations in the initial stages of cavity design.\n\n## Introduction\nThe external-Q factor is a fundamental parameter of the cavity resonator; it determines the electromagnetic power\nradiated from the cavity to the waveguide.\nIn the case of superconducting cavities, the external Q is especially important because\nthe internal loss of rf power is negligible in comparison to the radiated power,\nand the bandwidth of the rf system is determined by the external Q.\nTherefore, it is essential to estimate the external Q while designing the cavity and rf system.\n\nThe standard method to evaluate the external Q is described in reference [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThis method uses the rf power radiated to the waveguide in addition to the cavity parameters\nto evaluate the external Q and coupling coefficient.\nIt also provides an equivalent circuit of the cavity coupled with the waveguide.\nThis treatment is widely used for the analysis of the cavity voltage because\nit precisely describes the electromagnetic field in the cavity.\n\nHowever, the aforementioned method has the following two problems.\nFirst, this method only yields an equivalent circuit coupled with an ideal transformer.\nTherefore, the properties of the actual circuit, such as the input impedance and reflection coefficient,\nare not correctly represented.\nSecond, the external Q can be obtained if only the input impedance, observed from the waveguide, is known[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nIn other words, the radiation power is not required to obtain the external Q.\n\nA general method to calculate the external Q using the input impedance is given in reference [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], which,\nhowever, requires numerical calculation.\nTherefore, in this paper, we derive an explicit formulas to determine the external Q by another approach based on the reflection coefficient.\nWe will see that the external Q are expressed in terms of the cavity parameters,\nthrough calculations of the refection coefficient for the two commonly used coupling schemes,\ni.e., capacitive and inductive coupling.\n\n## Reflection coefficient and external Q\n< g r a p h i c s

by\n$\\left|\\Gamma_0 \\right|$ and $\\left|\\Gamma_1 \\right|$, respectively.\n\nLet us suppose a general condition where a resonant cavity is coupled with a waveguide.\nThe reflection coefficient $\\Gamma$ represents a circle in the Smith chart around the resonance frequency,\nas shown in Fig. (Figure fig:gammageneral).\nWe use this circle to obtain the coupling coefficient $\\beta$, which is defined\nby the ratio of the unloaded Q to the external Q, i.e.,\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:betadef}\n\\beta\\coloneqq\\frac{Q_0}{Q_{\\mbox {\\tiny ext}}}.\n\n$$\n\nTo this end, let the minimum and maximum absolute values of the reflection coefficient be $\\left|\\Gamma_0 \\right|$\nand $\\left|\\Gamma_1 \\right|$, respectively, as shown in Fig. (Figure fig:gammageneral).\nNote that the points corresponding to the minimum and maximum reflection coefficients are at opposite positions\nacross the origin of the complex plane because $\\Gamma$ is a circle.\nThen, the voltage standing wave ratios corresponding to the minimum and maximum values of $\\left| \\Gamma \\right|$ are\ngiven by\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:sigma0}\n\\sigma_0=\\frac{1+\\left|\\Gamma_0 \\right|}{1-\\left|\\Gamma_0 \\right|}\n\n$$\nand\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:sigma1}\n\\sigma_1=\\frac{1+\\left|\\Gamma_1 \\right|}{1-\\left|\\Gamma_1 \\right|},\n\n$$\nrespectively.\nAccording to reference [Unknown Author, \"Unknown

Typically, these parameters are found through a series of bootstrapped calibration experiments which successively acquire more accurate information about a physical qubit. However, optimal parameters are typically different between devices and can also drift in time, which begets the need for an efficient calibration strategy. Here, we introduce a framework to understand the relationship between calibrations as a directed graph. With this approach, calibration is reduced to a graph traversal problem that is automatable and extensible.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nComputation on a quantum computer is realized by analog manipulations of large numbers of physical quantum bits (qubits). These control waveforms must be finely tuned as deviations from the ideal cause imperfect amplitudes and phases, inducing error. This presents a significant challenge as today's control hardware and qubit systems cannot be operated identically; each qubit's control must be calibrated individually, and ideal control parameters can drift in time. Furthermore, each qubit typically requires a host of different high fidelity operations, such as single-qubit rotations, multi-qubit gates, measurement, and reset for a digital quantum computer\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The field of quantum optimal control \u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] lies at the center of this challenge, where precise control over quantum systems has been demonstrated in state transfer\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], high-fidelity logic operations\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], combating control parameter drift\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and macroscopic quantum systems\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, quantum optimal control is typically applied to a single operation, such as calibrating a particular logic gate or quantum state. In this work, we focus on a broader challenge: how do we navigate the full suite of tasks required for a quantum computer, from initial device bring-up to logic operation calibration to algorithmic control?\n\nTypically, control parameters for a device are determined by following a carefully chosen sequence of calibration experiments, where the result of one experiment generally feeds into the next. The simplest strategy is to sequence through these experiments from start to end, in order. However, this breaks down with the introduction of parameter drift, the need for debugging, or the desire to reconfigure the system on-the-fly. Re-starting the sequence from the beginning repeatedly is non-ideal given the considerable time expense of the calibration sequence. Simply put, there is a need to move fluidly both forwards and backwards through a sequence of experiments, and for a way to represent the relationship between calibration experiments.\n\nFor small systems, complex calibrations and parameter drift can be handled by careful, manual tuning. Here, an adept user can navigate forwards and backwards through experiments for a handful of qubits, as they have learned the relationships between experiments through experience. It is this experience that provides inspiration for our work.\n\nNaturally, manual control is not scalable, so a fully autonomous solution is desireable to operate systems with more than a few dozen qubits. Our goal for this paper is to provide a high-level description of the interplay between calibration experiments, and how this can be used to identify and maintain control parameters for a quantum computer.\n\nTHE CALIBRATION PROBLEM\n\nWe define the calibration problem as follows:  What is the optimal way to identify and maintain control parameters for a system of physical qubits given incomplete system information? To begin, we define the following terms:\n\nParameter A qubit control parameter, such as the driving duration of a pi-pulse.\n\nExperiment A collection of static control waveforms and measurements where no parameters are varied. This may correspond to, for example, a gate sequence and measurement to determine the output probability distribution or a gate sequence and tomography to interrogate the state of the qubit(s). Typically each experiment is repeated a number of times to gather statistics.\n\nScan A collection of experiments where one or more parameters are varied. For example, a rabi driving scan where the length of the drive pulse is changed for each individual experiment. Scans can also be more complex, e.g. multi-parameter optimizations.\n\nFigure of merit A number measured using a scan or experiment used to quantify how well a qubit is operating.\n\nTolerance A threshold on a figure of merit for determining whether the control parameters are determined well enough. For example, we may specify that a pi pulse should be within $10^{-4}$ radians of a $\\pi$ rotation.\n\nSpec A figure of merit is either within tolerance (in spec) or not (out of spec).\n\nCalibrations (Cals)\n\nWe define a calibration (cal) as a procedure used to determine a new value for one or more parameters. A cal consists of the following components:\n\n* A set of parameters that are targets of cal.\n\n* A scan used to generate experimental data relevant to the parameters.\n\n* Functions used to analyze the experimental data to determine figures of merit. The figures of merit are used to determine if the parameters are in spec, and what the optimal parameter values are.\n\nThe Calibration loop\n\nCals share a generic structure, as follows:\n\n* Run scan.\n\n* Analyze data to determine optimal parameter values.\n\n* Update parameters.\n\nIn fully calibrating a system of qubits, this procedure is followed through a collection of different cal procedures across all of the qubits.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nAn example of a rabi driving cal. (1) The rabi driving scan is performed, consisting of a collection of experiments, where each experiment has a single drive length, and the average probability of the $\\ket{0}$ state is measured. (2) The data is analyzed, and the optimal drive length is determined. (3) The qubit parameter for the driving length of an X pulse is updated to the optimal value.\n\nDependencies\n\nMuch of the complexity in determining control parameters arises because calibration experiments can depend on one another. The process of calibrating a qubit uses bootstrapping, where parameters discovered from simple cals are fed into more sophisticated cals which enhance the control capabilities of a qubit beyond what could be done initially. In the rabi driving example (Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:rabi)), this scan can only be performed once we know the frequency at which to drive the qubit. In turn the qubit frequency cal can only be performed once we know how to measure the state of the qubit. In general, a cal can depend on parameters derived from other cals, which can themselves depend on other cals. This is especially tricky in the presence of drift: a parameter that drifts from its calibrated value during subsequent cals can poison the data.\n\nOPTIMUS\n\nOur goal is to build a system to solve the calibration problem with the following properties:\n\n* Calibrates a qubit system automatically from scratch (from its unknown initial state).\n\n* Chooses the sequence of calibrations to perform.\n\n* Takes a minimal amount of wall clock time.\n\n* Handles parameter drift, i.e. has a strategy for detecting drift and revisiting calibrations that may have drifted.\n\n* Detects if a calibration is working improperly via self-diagnosis.\n\nThe calibration graph\n\nWe introduce our approach to the calibration problem, named Optimus, which satisfies these properties. The essential insight of Optimus is to formulate the dependency relationships between calibrations as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each cal is represented by a node in the graph, and each dependence between cals is a directed edge. The direction of the edge denotes which cal depends on the other. For example, in Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:graph) we see that cal B depends on cal A, while cal 1 depends on cals D and F. Cal A is a root cal; it does not depend on any other cals and so can be run on a qubit system in an otherwise unknown state.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nCalibrations in a directed acyclic graph. As an example, we have an algorithm that we would like to run that depends on high fidelity single-qubit gates (1), two-qubit gates (2) and measurement (M). In turn, these cals have a graph of dependencies which extend back to the root.\n\nWhere does system knowledge live?\n\nSo far, we have only outlined a generic control system, and have not touched on where specific system information should live. Any person who has spent extensive time working with qubits has built up significant system specific knowledge, such as roughly what calibrations should be run in what order to bring up a qubit, what data for various experiments should look like, and what typical operation parameters are. So where does this information live?\n\nThe Optimus framework allows one to codify all of that lab experience explicitly into the graph in a useful way. The dependency structure of the graph, which experiments are used on each node, the tolerances for those experiments, analysis functions, etc all represent our knowledge of how the system works. We expect that these specifics will be different from a superconducting qubit system to that of ion traps or quantum dots, or even a different design of superconducting qubit. Even among one particular system there is some freedom in how the graph is constructed, and this is a good thing. We may use different graphs for different purposes, such as standard characterization vs high fidelity algorithm operation.\n\nBy putting all of this system knowledge into the calibration graph, multiple users can contribute to the collective knowledge of the best operating procedure. In manual operation, it takes time for new users to become familiar with all of the elements of system calibration, and users of different experience levels typically handle the system differently. Now, the graph represents the communal best working knowledge of how to solve the calibration problem. If one user finds a better way to write a node or structure the graph, they can systematically improve the calibration routine and distribute that to other users as the nodes are modular. The graph is also useful as a pedagogical tool, as it explicitly describes the relationships between calibrations, analysis functions, and thresholds.\n\nThe calibration problem on a DAG\n\nIn addition to the graph structure, we also introduce the state, which represents all current knowledge of the system based on previously acquired data. This knowledge is similar to an experimentalists lab notes: it contains information on which cals are working and when they were last run, for example. Each cal can be in a different state: \u201cin spec\u201d denoting that the figures of merit associated with the cal are in spec, or \u201cout of spec\u201d if they are out of spec. For example if we just successfully ran a cal we would mark it as in spec; if it failed we would mark it as out of spec; finally, if the state is unknown we would assume it is out of spec until validated. By definition, a cal cannot be in spec if it has a dependency out of spec; we address how to determine the state of the system in section\u00a0<ref>. With this formalism, we can restate the calibration problem in terms of the DAG, as seen in Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:anystate).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nThe calibration problem can be formulated in terms of a DAG. The dependency arrows point towards the root. The goal of the calibration problem is to take systems with little information (A) or partial information (B, C) and bring them to the state where all cals are in spec. *Note that cals where the state is unknown (e.g. never previously measured) are assumed to be out of spec.\n\nTo help combat parameter drift, we also associate a timeout period with each cal, and record the time when the cal was last run. The timeout period is the characteristic drift time, or the timescale that we expect that the parameters associated with the cal should be validated or updated. Note that these timeout periods can be experimentally determined by processing data generated from system operation.\n\nInteracting with calibrations\n\nThere are a number of ways of interacting with calibrations, depending on what information we are trying to learn. In an effort to reduce the amount of time Optimus consumes (the cost of calibrations), we introduce three methods, , , and . These three functions gate expensive calibrations that may not be needed: , , and  acquire no data, little data, and lots of data respectively. Importantly, only  (which acquires significant amounts of data) is used to update parameter values, as it provides the highest confidence.\n\ncheck_state\n\nanswers the question, \u201cBased on our prior knowledge of the system, and without experiments, are we confident the figures of merit associated with this cal are in spec?\u201d The purpose of  is to help higher level algorithms determine where to allocate resources running experiments.\n\nshould report a pass if and only if the following are satisfied:\n\n* The cal has had  or  pass within the timeout period.\n\n* The cal has not failed  without resolution.\n\n* No dependencies have been recalibrated since the last time  or  was run on this cal.\n\n* All dependencies pass .\n\ncheck_data\n\nThe purpose of  is to experimentally determine the state of the node, while running a minimal number of experiments.  answers two questions, \u201cIs the parameter associated with this cal in spec, and is the cal scan working as expected?\u201d\n\nThis can be understood with a Rabi driving cal example, as shown in Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:checkdata).  takes a minimal amount of data (the red points), which we superimpose onto the black dots, representing what we expect the data to look like. In the first case, we see that the red dots lie within acceptable tolerance of the black dots indicating that our parameter matches the expectation for the experiment and is in spec. In the second case, we see that there is a shift between where the expected and actual minimal of the curve are, indicating the parameter is out of spec (which is recorded in the state). In the third case, we see that the data looks like noise instead of lying on a curve, indicating that the scan for this cal is not working and returning bad data. When we receive bad data, it likely indicates that a dependence for this cal has a bad state.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nuses a minimal number of points to distinguish between three cases. Case 1: the data lies on top of the expected data indicating the parameter is in spec. Case 2: the data are offset from the expected data, indicating the parameter is not in spec. Case 3: The data is noise, indicating a dependency is bad.\n\ncalibrate\n\nis the canonical calibration loop described above. We allow  to take as much  data as needed to determine the optimal value for a parameter. We then analyze the data and update the parameter associated with the cal. Additionally, we verify that the data generated by the calibration scan are not bad data. In the case of bad data, we generate an error as bad data should have been caught previously by .\n\nCalibration attributes\n\nFor completeness, we elaborate on what constitutes a calibration node:\n\n* Parameter(s) that are the target of cal.\n\n* Scans used to generate experimental data relevant to the parameter(s).\n\n*  scan (minimal data).\n\n* calibration scan (more data).\n\n* Helper functions for analysis.\n\n*  analysis.\n\n*  analysis.\n\n* Supplementary checks, e.g. for qubit parameter inconsistencies.\n\n* Tolerances for a figure of merit.\n\n* Timeout period.\n\nGraph traversal\n\nWith the specifics of how cals are defined and how we can interact with them, system calibration is now reduced to a graph traversal problem. So, we need algorithms to determine which cals to run, and the order they will execute.\n\nWith this in mind, we introduce two algorithms for navigating the DAG:  and . The specific nature of these algorithms is to minimize the amount of time is the required to bring the system back to a good state.\n\nMaintain concept\n\nis the primary interface for Optimus, and is the highest level algorithm. We call  on the cal that we want in spec, and  will call all necessary subroutines to get that node in spec. The goal of  is to only begin acquiring data on the node closest to root that fails . We do this as we want to begin changing parameters on the least dependent calibration and work forwards from there.\n\nAt the first node that fails , the  algorithm will begin interrogating state of the node experimentally with . Depending on the outcome, it will either proceed (in spec),  and proceed (out of spec), or call  (bad data), see Fig\u00a0(Figure fig:maintain). It will then continue iterating through the graph using this basic strategy.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nis called on the cal we want in a good state, and is called recursively down to the root node. The node closest to the root which fails  runs , and decide to proceed, , or call  depending on the outcome. We iterate recursively through the graph with this strategy.\n\nDiagnose concept\n\nis a separate algorithm that is called by , in the special case that  identifies bad data. The  algorithm represents a strategy shift from ;  makes no calls to  and only makes decisions based on data returned from  and , see Fig\u00a0(Figure fig:diagnose). This can be understood by realizing that  assumes that our knowledge of the state of the system matches the actual state of the system. If we knew a cal would return bad data, we wouldn't dedicate experiments to it.  is only invoked when we have experimentally determined there is a mismatch between the actual system state and our knowledge of the system state. So, the purpose of  is to repair inaccuracies in our knowledge of the state of the system, so that  can resume.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDiagnose is called on a cal that has returned bad data from . We then investigate each of the dependents. If a dependent is in spec, we continue to other dependents of the original cal. If it is out of spec, we  and proceed towards the original cal. If we get bad data, we recursively .\n\nSaving time\n\nWe design  to start in the optimal location (to the best of our knowledge) to avoid extra work. For example, if a node times out, so that we can no longer consider it to be in spec, then all higher-level nodes that depend on it (directly or indirectly) are also out of spec. So, to bring the system back into a good state, we want to begin with the lowest-level node that we determine to be out of spec and work upwards from there. This minimizes the work we have to do because we should not bother trying to tune up a higher level node when we know a lower-level dependency is not in spec.\n\nSimilarly, switching directions in the  phase after we find bad data is also a way to avoid doing extra work. When we find that the data for a particular node is bad, even though we believe that its dependencies are in spec, we first check the immediate dependencies more carefully. If these can be brought back into spec, then we are all good and can continue. We don't immediately jump to the conclusion that every dependent node all the way back to the root is bad, which would cause us to start over and do a lot of extra work. So we switch directions and work from the top down in the  phase.\n\nNote on acyclicity\n\nAcyclicity is a desirable property for the graph to have, as it makes the graph traversal algorithms easier to build and control. However, our systems are not naturally acyclic. To handle this, we can unwrap a cyclic dependence into layers of precision. For example, as in Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:acyclicity) if A and B both depend on each other, we can unwrap it into layers of coarse, mid, and fine calibration. By doing this, we essentially iterate through parameter space until we achieve the desired level of precision. Alternatively, in some cases we can design a cal scan that simultaneously optimizes both parameters. Deciding between these cases is an element of the overall DAG design.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nAcyclicity can be removed by unwrapped cyclic dependencies into layers of precision. This allows us to iterate back and forth updating parameters until they are both finely tuned.\n\nHandling Errors\n\nIn some cases, we may raise errors when encountering unexpected behavior. For example, we raise a DiagnoseError if we find that  was invoked, but no dependencies were out of spec. In this case (assuming we have defined tolerances that are physically achievable), it is possible the device is behaving in a non-ideal manner, or the DAG does not accurately represent the system behavior. We can try bringing up the device in a different operating condition, or mark it as bad.\n\nMulti-qubit calibrations\n\nSystem tune-up requires multi-qubit calibrations in addition to single-qubit calibrations. Ensuring these behave as expected involves unifying methods such as  to to work in the following way: if one qubit fails  due to some dependency but the other succeeds, the multi-qubit node should fail . These issues can be addressed in the specific software implementation.\n\nExtensibility to other physical systems\n\nWe have written Optimus with control over physical qubit systems for quantum computing. However this approach is generically applicable to a variety of platforms that require careful calibration of a physical system.\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nWe have presented Optimus as a solution to the calibration problem, where we reformulated the suite of calibration scans as a directed acyclic graph. We then defined a number of methods of interacting with different cals as a way to minimize the number of experiments require to fully calibrate a system. Doing this allows us to use graph traversal strategies to tackle the calibration problem. We have been using Optimus to successfully automate the calibration of multi-qubit systems.\n\ntocchapterBibliography\napsrev\n\n"}

Superconducting quantum computing technology [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] is currently approaching the threshold for quantum error correction. Compared with the recent rapid progress in the increase of single-qubit and two-qubit gate fidelities, qubit measurement shows somewhat slower progress. The development of faster and higher-fidelity qubit readout remains an important task.\n\nIn circuit QED (cQED) [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], the qubit state\nis inferred by measuring the state-dependent frequency shift of the\nresonator via homodyne detection. This method introduces an unwanted\ndecay channel [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for the qubit due to the energy\nleakage through the resonator into the transmission line, the\nprocess known as the Purcell effect [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThe Purcell effect is one of the limiting factors for high fidelity\nqubit readout.\n\nIn principle, the Purcell rate can be suppressed by increasing the\nqubit-resonator detuning, decreasing the qubit-resonator coupling,\nor decreasing the resonator bandwidth due to damping. However,\nthese simple methods increase the time needed to measure the qubit.\nThis leads to a trade-off between the qubit relaxation and\nmeasurement time, whereas it is desirable to suppress the Purcell rate\nwithout compromising qubit measurement. Several proposals have been\nput forward for this purpose, which include employing a Purcell\nfilter [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], engineering a Purcell-protected\nqubit [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], or using a tunable coupler that\ndecouples the transmission line from the resonator during the\nqubit-resonator interaction, thereby avoiding the Purcell effect\naltogether [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe general idea of the Purcell filter is to impede the propagation of\nthe photon emitted at the qubit frequency, compared with propagation\nof the microwave field at the resonator frequency, used for the\nqubit measurement. A notch (band-rejection) filter detuned by 1.7\nGHz from the resonator frequency was realized in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nA factor of 50 reduction in the Purcell rate was demonstrated when\nthe qubit frequency was placed in the rejection band of the filter.\nA bandpass filter with the quality factor $Q_{\\rm f}\\simeq 30$ (and\ncorresponding bandwidth of 0.22 GHz) centered near the\nresonator frequency was used in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. This\nallowed the qubit measurement within 140 ns with fidelities\n$F_{|1\\rangle}=98.7$ and $F_{|0\\rangle}=99.3$ for the two qubit\nstates. (The bandpass Purcell filter was also used in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]; it\nhad a similar design with a few minor changes.) A major advantage of\nthe bandpass Purcell filter in comparison with the notch filter is\nthe possibility to keep strongly reduced Purcell rate for qubits\nwith practically any frequency (except near the filter frequency),\nthus allowing quantum gates based on tuning the qubit frequency,\nand also allowing multiplexed readout of several qubits by placing\nreadout resonators with different frequencies within the filter\nbandwidth.\n\nIn this work, we analyze the Purcell filter of Ref.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] using both semiclassical and quantum approaches\nand considering both the weak and the strong drive regimes. Our\nsemiclassical analysis uses somewhat different language compared\nto the analysis in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]; however, the results are\nvery similar (they show that with the filter the Purcell rate can be\nsuppressed by two orders of magnitude, while maintaining the same\nmeasurement time). The results of the quantum analysis in the regime\nof a weak measurement drive or no drive (considering the\nsingle-photon subspace) practically coincide with the semiclassical\nresults. In the presence of strong microwave drive, the Purcell rate\nis further suppressed with increasing drive strength. We have found\nthat this suppression is stronger than that obtained without a\nfilter [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn Sec. II we discuss the general idea of the bandpass Purcell\nfilter and analyze its operation semiclassically. Section III is\ndevoted to the quantum calculation of the Purcell rate in the\npresence of the bandpass Purcell filter. In Sec. IV we discuss further\nsuppression of the Purcell rate due to an applied microwave drive.\nSection V is the Conclusion.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Overview of article' section of the paper.", "completion": "This article is structured to mimic the full workflow of building a new cQED experimental setup in the laboratory. Each step plays a crucial role in ensuring the eventual realization of a robust quantum device and requires a multitude of careful considerations, which are often skipped over in research articles. In this tutorial, we will aim to provide a step-by-step guide on these practical details, with a specific focus on devices that employ transmon qubits\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIt is important to highlight that this article is not intended as a comprehensive review of the entire field of cQED or as an exhaustive summary of the wide range of techniques that have been developed by the community. Rather, it aims to discuss a selected set of basic tools and useful intuitions that, in the opinion of the authors, are important for understanding the practical aspects of implementing cQED experiments. In particular, we aim to offer a tutorial style walk-through on the design and characterization of cQED devices while providing more general overviews and useful references on the other aspects of the workflow.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nOverview of the crucial hardware building blocks and experimental processes in realizing a quantum system in cQED. (a) The full-stack of cQED quantum computer. Each layer represents an important element that must be carefully constructed and optimized, in order to construct full-stack quantum processors in cQED. (b) The engineering cycle of a cQED device. The desired target application influences the chip\u2019s Hamiltonian design (<ref>) in which an equivalent circuit and its target parameters are determined. This design serves as the input for a second design step in which the geometry and layout of the device is determined, taking into account the constraints of the fabrication process (<ref>). After fabricating the device, the system is carefully characterized (<ref>) and the resulting information is used to inform the next design iteration to bring the system closer towards the desired Hamiltonian.\n\nWe start by providing a concise summary of the physics of cQED in Sec.\u00a0<ref>. In addition, we will also present the process of constructing specific Hamiltonians with the fundamental ingredients afforded by the cQED platform. The purpose of this segment is to provide a general basis for the subsequent discussions and provide useful resources for more advanced readers to further investigate the more technically-involved concepts.\n\nIn Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we introduce the necessary ingredients and tools for translating the target Hamiltonians into a physical circuit. This requires an iteration cycle consisting of configuring the device layout and circuit components, simulating the electromagnetic mode structures, and extracting of the relevant Hamiltonian parameters. We will further highlight some of the main limiting factors of the coherence of quantum circuits and summarize the known design strategies to mitigate them. This is followed by a short discussion of device fabrication as well as considerations towards achieving better yield and reliability.\n\nIn Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we move on to provide an overview of the configuration of cryogenic and room temperature environments required to ensure both the coherence and controllability of cQED devices. Here, we will highlight some of the crucial factors involved in the filtering and shielding of the quantum devices in the dilution refrigerator (DR). Furthermore, we will also provide an overview of the typical room temperature microwave signal processing elements and control electronics used in providing sophisticated pulse sequences for quantum operations.\n\nIn Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we will present the typical workflow of characterizing and calibrating a cQED device. Here, we cover a series of basic tune-up procedures, from cavity and qubit spectroscopy, coherence measurements, to qubit rotation diagnosis and readout optimization. The information we learn through these measurements offer a comprehensive view of the performance of individual quantum elements, and provide valuable feedback for future iterations of device designs. We then discuss a few more advanced topics including implementing two-qubit gates, characterization of quantum operations, and control of quantum memory cavities, which are crucial in building towards  high-fidelity experiments in multi-qubit systems.\n\nThe building blocks introduced thus far form an iterative cycle (Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:overview)(b)) that enables us to develop cQED devices increasingly robust performance for the desired applications. Collectively, they culminate in the ultimate goal of realizing a robust universal quantum computer capable of tackling real-world challenges. In this tutorial, we do not attempt give a prescription of how to realize and operate a large-scale quantum computer since that remains an open pursuit of the entire community. Instead, in Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we will switch gears to provide a brief review of two concurrent research thrusts that aim to develop more robust and powerful quantum devices. First, we discuss the recent developments and main challenges in scaling up planar cQED devices from NISQ era processors to a robust, universal quantum machine. Subsequently, we will illustrate how superconducting cavities can be utilized to realize robust quantum modules with first order quantum error correction. Finally, we will provide some prospective on the challenges and future directions towards using them as building blocks for a fault-tolerant and general-purpose quantum computer."}
{"prompt": "Explain the 'Outlook' section of the paper.", "completion": "Summary of good thing on FTF\nOur work demonstrates an architecture in which high-fidelity, robustness against parameter variations, and extensibility are simultaneously realized.\nWe observed millisecond fluxonium lifetimes despite couplings to neighboring qubits, resonators, flux lines, and charge lines, all within a 2D-planar architecture.\nBoth the single- and two-qubit gates performed here are also simple \u2013 operating on the basis of a Rabi oscillation.\nThe relative simplicity of this two-qubit gate was afforded by the FTF Hamiltonian and yielded a high fidelity operation across a large frequency-tunable range, reproduced across multiple devices.\n\nZZ, and benefits for over gate schemes\nOne of the most notable features of the FTF scheme is the capacity for large coupling strengths while simultaneously reducing the\u00a0$ZZ$ interaction strength to kHz levels.\nThis is all done without strict parameter matching or additional drives. In fact, even computational state gates such as iSWAP or cross-resonance can benefit from FTF by utilizing this\u00a0$ZZ$ reduction without worrying about additional complications for single- and two-qubit gates. A fixed-frequency transmon (or simply a resonator) would suffice for this use case (see appendix:ZZ).\n\nFuture improvements\nDespite already high gate fidelities, many avenues exist for improvement. First and foremost, the device heating when DC biasing qubits to their simultaneous sweet spot and tuning the coupler flux reduces the coherence times of our qubits.\nBy optimizing the mutual inductance between the flux lines and the qubits and improving the thermalization and filtering of the flux lines, we anticipate improvements in future experiments.\nEven in the absence of local heating, we estimate a photon-shot-noise limit of\u00a0${T_2\\sim \\SI{400}{\\micro s}}$, assuming an effective resonator temperature of\u00a0$T_\\text{eff} = \\SI{55}{mK}$\u00a0[Yan, Fei, Campbell, Dan, Krantz, Philip, Kjaergaard, Morten, Kim, David, Yoder, Jonilyn L, Hover, David, Sears, Adam, Kerman, Andrew J, Orlando, Terry P, others, \"Distinguishing coherent and thermal photon noise in a circuit quantum electrodynamical system\", 2018].\nSimply decreasing\u00a0$\\chi$ and\u00a0$\\kappa$ should increase this\u00a0$T_2$ limit at the expense of readout speed, which could be a worthwhile exchange in the high\u00a0$T_1$, low\u00a0$T_2$ limit.\n\nAs is typical of fluxonium gates involving the non-computational states, the largest contribution to gate infidelity was the coherence of the\u00a0$\\ket{201}$, $\\ket{111}$,\u00a0$\\ket{102}$ manifold. Yet, the lifetimes of these states were much lower than expected, given coherence times measured on transmons with similar frequencies. By optimizing regions of high electric field density that exist in our current design (notably the small fluxonium-transmon capacitor gap), we expect to improve these coherence times as well.\n\nOutlook for fluxonium quantum computing\nWhile fluxonium has long exhibited impressive individual qubit performance, our work demonstrates a viable path forward for fluxonium-based large-scale processors capable of pushing the boundaries of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing.\n\nL.D. is grateful to Devin Underwood for his continued support throughout this project, especially during the lockdown years.

{"prompt": "Explain the 'Introduction' section of the paper.", "completion": "The physical realization of quantum information processing in\nsuperconducting circuits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] has enjoyed\nremarkable progress over the last decade. While initially decoherence limited single qubits to only a few coherent oscillations [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], high precision, general quantum conrol is now possible over single- and few-qubit systems.\nThis is evident by the demonstration of high-fidelity nonclassical states of\ntwo-qubit [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and three-qubit [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] systems, harmonic oscillators [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and the demonstration of small quantum algorithms [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThis success is partially due to our current understanding of sources of noise and the development of techniques and systems that are  resilient to these noise sources. Examples include the optimum working point [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and the introduction of low-dispersion qubits like the transmon [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and the capacitively shunted flux\nqubit [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. On the other hand, a promising route to success are qubits that contains only a minimal number of elements, such as the phase qubit  [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. What these systems have in common is a weakly anharmonic energy level structure, i.e., the states that are outside of the qubit subspace spanned by $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ are only separated from each other and the qubit subspace by energies only slightly different than the qubit frequency.\n\nHaving a weakly anharmonic qubit poses a challenge in the implementation of quantum gates. It is known [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] that the time evolution operator of a linearly driven harmonic oscillator is a combination of a coherent displacement operator tracking the classical trajectory\nof the driven oscillator and a global phase factor. This evolution encompasses all energy levels and cannot be reduced to a single-qubit rotation. Spectroscopically, this can be understood as follows: a single qubit rotation is typically implemented by a pulse of radiation resonant with the qubit energy splitting.\nIn a harmonic oscillator, all energy splittings are the same, so driving one transition drives all others at the same time. A system starting initially in an energy eigenstate will quickly be driven into a superposition over many energy eigenstates. By this token, it is crucial that a qubit is nonlinear [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], that is that the transition frequency of the qubit levels is different by an amount $\\Delta$ from the transition frequencies to the non-qubit levels. Spectroscopically, we would expect that whenever the bandwidth of the pulse comes close to $\\Delta$, i.e., when its duration becomes short on the scale of $1/\\Delta$, we expect\nsignificant leakage to higher states. Thus, it is a challenge to implement fast single-qubit gates in weakly anharmonic systems. The implementation of faster gates is important as it allows more gates to be executed in a given coherence time, an important step toward high-fidelity quantum logic.\n\nWhile superconducting qubits are the most well known example of qubits made from weakly anharmonic oscillators, there are many other examples. In fact, it has been shown that no physical particle can be a true qubit[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Examples of leakage states include higher vibrational states in optical lattices [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], polarized spin states in the singlet-triplet qubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and auxiliary states in ion traps [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and Rydberg atoms [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn this paper, we outline a suite of strategies to implement single-qubit quantum gates in qubits singled out from the spectrum of an anharmonic oscillator.\nWe develop an adiabatic expansion technique that leads to order-by-order constraint equations on a toggling-frame transformation and the control fields. The space of solutions contains the DRAG strategy proposed in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and re-analyzed in the presence of an oscillator bath in Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] as a special case, as well as simpler versions of DRAG that do not require time-dependent energy bias or phase ramping, similar to those\nimplemented in Refs. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Additionally, we derive optimal solutions to a given order by minimizing the errors manifested by the fields in the next higher order.\n\nThe outline of the paper is as follows: in Sec. <ref> we review qubits made from anharmonic oscillator and introduce their rotating-wave description. Sec. <ref> describes Gaussian pulses and shows how they lead to both phase and population errors. In Sec. <ref> we extend the DRAG scheme of Ref. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] to find a wealth of different pulse shapes that give improved performance over Gaussian shaping. In Sec. <ref> we apply the generalized scheme to cases where there are more then one leakage level. Finally we conclude in Sec. <ref>."}
{"prompt": "Explain the 'General leakage removal' section of the paper.", "completion": "In this appendix, we give the general theory for finding adiabatic pulses for controlling subsystems of a larger system. The systems that will obey this theory are those in which transitions out of the subspace occur an energy cost $\\Delta$. Furthermore, we assume this cost is the largest rate in the problem so that we  can form a perturbation expansion around $\\epsilon=1/t_g\\Delta$, where $t_g$ is the gate time. To be more specific, imagine a Hilbert space that can be partitioned into two subspaces, $\\mathcal{H} = \\mathcal{H}_{\\rm{control}}\\oplus \\mathcal{H}_{\\rm{leakage}}$, where we wish to perform some quantum gate solely in the control subspace, but with control Hamiltonians $H_m$ that act on the complete Hilbert space. That is, the general Hamiltonian for this system is\nH(t) = H_0 + \u2211_m u_m(t) H_m,\nwhere we require that $H_0$ takes the form\nH_0 = 0 \u2295\u0394\u2211_k \u0394_k/\u0394 \u03a0_k.\nHere $\\Pi_k=\\ket{k}\\bra{k}$ and we note that $H_0$ only has support on the leakage subspace.  Since, $\\Delta$ is assumed to be large then $H_0$ is the dominant term in the Hamiltonian, and the leakage subspace is off-resonant.  It is less clear what constraints must be placed on the control Hamiltonians, $H_m$.  Certainly, if we wish to perform a general gate on the control subspace, then they must be controllable on that subspace, however, in order to completely eliminate leakage errors there are additional constraints, which we now determine.\n\nThe general protocol to determine these extra constraints arising from leakage is to first determine the Hamiltonian in the control subspace that implements the desired gate. That is, find the functions $h_l(t)$ of the Hamiltonian $H_\\mathrm{sp}$\n\nH_sp = \u2211_l=1^d_c^2-1 h_l(t)B_l\nwhere $B_l$ is some orthogonal basis for operators in the control subspace of dimension $d_c$, that implement the desired gate. Next we define an effective Hamiltonian $H_\\mathrm{eff}(t)$ in the complete space by Eq. (<ref>) with the only requirement on $A$ being that $A(0) = A(t_g) = \\openone$ so that the frame transformation vanishes at the boundaries. The constraints on this effective Hamiltonian to be satisfied are\n$$\n\\label{eq:gconds}\n&&\\hspace{-5mm}\\mathrm{Tr}[ H_\\mathrm{eff}(t) B_l]=h_l(t),  \\\\\n&&\\hspace{-5mm}\\bra{j} H_\\mathrm{eff}(t)\\ket{k}=0~ \\mathrm{for}~0 \\leq j < d_c~\\mathrm{and}~d_c \\leq k < d,\\label{eq:gconds2}\n\n$$ Here Eq. (<ref>) constrains the $H_\\mathrm{eff}(t)$ to be equivalent to Eq. (<ref>) and Eq. (<ref>)  cancel the coupling between the control subspace and the leakage subspace. If theses constraints can be satisfied we have found a control set $\\{u_m(t)\\}$ that implements the desired gate with out leakage. In practice, this will not be possible but using the following procedure we can develop a perturbative approach.\n\nThe adiabatic transformation $A$ can be written as $A(t) = e^{-i S(t)}$ and we can write both $H(t)$ and the frame transformation $S(t)$ as power series in the small parameter $\\epsilon$, as\n$$\n\nH(t) = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}H_0+\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\epsilon^n  H^{(n)}(t).\n\n$$ and\nS(t) = \u2211_n=1^\u221e S^(n)(t) \u03f5^l.\nNote the power expansion starts at $n=1$ as we restrict the transformation to be a perturbation in $\\epsilon$.\nRewriting Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) in terms of $S$, as opposed to $A$, we obtain\n$$\n\n\\begin{split}\nH_\\mathrm{eff}(t) =& \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\textrm{ad}[i S(t)] \\right)^j H(t) /j! \\\\\n&+ i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\left(\\sum_{j=0}^\\infty  (i)^j S^j(t)/j! \\right) \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-i)^k S^k(t)/k! \\right),\n\\end{split}\n\n$$\nwhere $\\textrm{ad}[A]$ is the linear superoperator defined by $\\textrm{ad}[A] B = [A,B] $ and we have used a Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) and Taylor expansion for the first and last term respectively.  From this form of $H_\\mathrm{eff}(t)$ we can isolate powers of $\\epsilon$ and arrive at\n$$\n\\label{eq:rec}\nH_\\mathrm{eff}^{(n)}(t)=H_\\mathrm{extra}^{(n)}(t)+H^{(n)}(t) + i [S^{(n+1)}(t),H_0]\n\n$$ for $n\\geq0$. Here $H_\\mathrm{extra}^{(n)}(t)$ is a rather complicated expression which for the first few orders is\n\n$$\n\\label{eq:hextra}\nH_\\mathrm{extra}^{(0)} (t)&=& 0 \\\\\nH_\\mathrm{extra}^{(1)}(t) &=&  i [S^{(1)}(t),H^{(0)}(t)]- [S^{(1)}(t),[S^{(1)}(t),H_0]]/2-\\dot{S}^{(1)}(t).\\label{eq:hextra1}\\\\\nH_\\mathrm{extra}^{(2)}(t) &=&  i [S^{(2)}(t),H^{(0)}(t)]+i [S^{(1)}(t),H^{(1)}(t)]- [S^{(1)}(t),[S^{(1)}(t),H^{(0)}(t)]]/2- [S^{(1)}(t),[S^{(2)}(t),H_0]]/2\\nonumber\\\\&&\n- [S^{(2)}(t),[S^{(1)}(t),H_0]]/2-i[{S}^{(1)}(t),[{S}^{(1)}(t),[{S}^{(1)}(t),H_0]]]/6+i[\\dot{S}^{(1)}(t),{S}^{(1)}(t)]/2-\\dot{S}^{(2)}(t).\\label{eq:hextra2}\n\\\\\nH_\\mathrm{extra}^{(3)}(t) &=&  i [S^{(3)}(t),H^{(0)}(t)]+i [S^{(2)}(t),H^{(1)}(t)]+i [S^{(1)}(t),H^{(2)}(t)]  - [S^{(1)}(t),[S^{(1)}(t),H^{(1)}(t)]]/2\\nonumber\n\\\\\n&&- [S^{(1)}(t),[S^{(2)}(t),H^{(0)}(t)]]/2- [S^{(2)}(t),[S^{(1)}(t),H^{(0)}(t)]]/2-i[S^{(1)}(t),[S^{(1)}(t),[S^{(1)}(t),H^{(0)}(t)]]/6\\nonumber\n\\\\\n&&- [S^{(1)}(t),[S^{(3)}(t),H_0]]/2- [S^{(3)}(t),[S^{(1)}(t),H_0]]/2-[S^{(2)}(t),[S^{(2)}(t),H_0]]/2\\nonumber\\\\&&-i[{S}^{(1)}(t),[{S}^{(1)}(t),[{S}^{(2)}(t),H_0]]]/6\n-i[{S}^{(2)}(t),[{S}^{(1)}(t),[{S}^{(2)}(t),H_0]]]/6-i[{S}^{(1)}(t),[{S}^{(2)}(t),[S^{(1)}(t),H_0]]]/6\\nonumber\\\\&&+[{S}^{(1)}(t),[{S}^{(1)}(t),[{S}^{(1)}(t),[S^{(1)}(t),H_0]]]/24\n+i[\\dot{S}^{(1)}(t),{S}^{(2)}(t)]/2+i[\\dot{S}^{(2)}(t),{S}^{(1)}(t)]/2\\nonumber\\\\&&-[{S}^{(1)}(t),[\\dot{S}^{(1)}(t),{S}^{(1)}(t)]/6-\\dot{S}^{(3)}(t).\\label{eq:hextra3}\n\n$$\nThis expansion bears some formal similarity to the Schrieffer-Wolf/van-Vleck/adiabatic elimination expansion [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] which means that a compact closed expression to any order is unlikely to exist.\nThis expression for $H_\\mathrm{eff}^{(n)}(t)$ is useful as it allows us to separate the free variables $H^{(n)}(t)$ and $S^{(n+1)}(t)$ for the order $n$ expression from those that are used to satisfy the conditions in Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>) for order $n-1$, which only occur in the expression for $H_\\mathrm{extra}^{(n)}(t)$. To see this more clearly we can used the above to rewrite Eq. (<ref>) for each order $n$ as\n\n\u2211_m u_m^(n)Tr[H_mB_l] = h_l^(n) -Tr[H_extra^(n)(t)B_l].\nfor $0< l< d_c^2$ where  $h_l^{(n)}$ is the $n^\\mathrm{th}$ order expression for $h_l$. Furthermore Eq. (<ref>) for each order $n$ becomes\n\nS_j,k^(n+1)=i\u0394/\u0394_k  \u27e8j| [H_extra^(n)(t)+\u2211_mu_m^(n) H_m ]|k\u27e9\nfor $0 \\leq j \\leq d_c$ and $d_c \\leq k < d$.\nHere we have used that $H_0 $ has no weight in the control subspace. Since $H_\\mathrm{extra}^{(n)}$ only depends on $S_{j,k}^{(n)}$, $H_0$, and $H^{(n-1)}$ then Eqs. (<ref>) and (<ref>) are well formed.  The components of $S^{(n+1)}(t)$ that haven't yet been defined are free parameters in our theory.  Choosing a different functional form for the remaining matrix elements gives us the different forms of a DRAG solution.  It is necessary that the frame transformation vanish at $t= 0$ and $t=t_g$, which may restrict some of the freedoms we have in assigning value to the otherwise unconstrained elements of $S^{(n+1)}(t)$.  At each order of approximation, specifying the values of $H^{(n)}(t)$  and $S^{(n+1)}(t)$ fully determines $H_\\mathrm{extra}^{(n+1)}(t)$ and so we can iterate this procedure indefinitely, though at some point the derivatives of $S$ that appear in $H_\\mathrm{eff}(t)$ will likely become large, causing the adiabatic expansion to break down.\n\n10\n\nMakhlin2001\nY.\u00a0Makhlin, G.\u00a0Sch\u00f6n, and A.\u00a0Shnirman, Rev.

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Drive crosstalk' section of the paper.", "completion": "< g r a p h i c s >\n\nDrive crosstalk characterization. For each drive line (DL) targeting qubit $Qi$, crosstalk is expressed as the logarithm of the ratio between the amplitude of a $\\pi$-pulse on the target qubit, $a_i^{\\mathrm{DL} Qi}$, and the amplitude of a $\\pi$-pulse on any other qubit $j$, $a_j^{\\mathrm{DL} Qi}$. The hatched gray area corresponds to cross-driving of far detuned qubits ($\\sim$2 GHz), see text for details. White matrix elements without annotation correspond to DL-qubit pairs with cross-driving ratios $<-1.6$.\n\nDuring the execution of multi-qubit quantum circuits, individual qubits are susceptible to off-resonant driving mediated by microwave pulses applied to drive lines designed to address other qubits.\nEnsuring low cross-driving is therefore essential for the successful execution of the surface code.\n\nWe characterize the coupling rates of each drive line (DL $Qi$) to all other qubits on the device, by measuring the excited state population of qubit $Qj$ after applying a 100-ns-long Gaussian drive pulse to drive line DL $Qi$ at the frequency of qubit $Qj$. We sweep the pulse amplitude and fit a cosine function to the measured data to obtain the amplitude $a_j^{\\mathrm{DL}\\, Qi}$ corresponding to a $\\pi$-rotation induced on qubit $Qj$. As a measure of cross-driving, we normalize each value by the $\\pi$-pulse amplitude of the target qubit $a_i^{\\mathrm{DL}\\,Qi}$ to obtain the cross-driving ratios, of which we show the negative logarithm  $-\\log_{10}\\left({a_j^{\\mathrm{DL} \\,Qi}}/{a_i^{\\mathrm{DL}\\,Qi}}\\right)$ in <ref>. Given the chosen pulse duration and the maximum drive rate which we can apply without compressing the up-conversion IQ-mixer, this method allows us to resolve cross-driving ratios down to about $-\\log_{10}\\left({a_j^{\\mathrm{DL} \\,Qi}}/{a_i^{\\mathrm{DL}\\,Qi}}\\right)\\approx -1.6$, or equivalently a Rabi rotation angle of 4.6 degrees. We find the off-diagonal elements of the cross-driving matrix on average 1.5 orders of magnitude smaller than the drive rate of the target qubit, which provides an upper bound for the cross-driving of $Qj$ via DL $Qi$, since pulses applied to DL $Qi$ during the execution of the surface code are detuned from the frequency of $Qj$.\n\nSome auxiliary-data qubit pairs in physical proximity exhibit larger crosstalk, most likely mediated by the qubit-qubit coupling resonator.\nHowever, for all these pairs, the drive line addresses a qubit in the other frequency band (see <ref>a and <ref>c for a visual representation of the geometry and the frequency bands) than the cross-coupled qubit (see hatched region in <ref>), which strongly suppresses the effective cross-driving during device operation. Taking both the relative detunings and the experimentally characterized cross-driving ratios into account, we estimate the gate error induced on $Qj$ resulting from applying a $\\pi$-pulse on $Qi$ via DL $Qi$ and find that the gate error is smaller than 0.01\n\nFor qubit pairs within the same frequency band, we find that the expected gate error is smaller than 0.2\nfor the drive line DL D5 and qubits D1 and D4, for which the expected gate errors are 19.2\nAs crosstalk on that scale would significantly impact the execution of the surface code, we compensate the cross-driving of DL D5 on D1 and D4 with an interferometric cancellation drive pulse which has opposite amplitude but is otherwise identical to the pulse arriving at D1 via DL D5.\n\nNote that this characterization measurement was performed in a separate cooldown of the same device."}

Again, this process is equivalently referred to as \u201c$T_1$ relaxation\", \u201cenergy relaxation\", or \u201clongitudinal relaxation\". As stated above, $T_1$ is the characteristic time scale of the decay.

Pulses in the time domain correspond to bandpass filters in the frequency domain (lower panel) which serve to shape the noise power spectrum seen by the qubit. The centroid of the bandpass filter shifts to higher frequencies as $N$ is increased. For noise that decreases with frequency, such as $1/f$ noise, larger $N$ corresponds to less integrated noise impinging on the qubit.\n\n(b) CPMG pulse sequence applied to a flux qubit biased at a point that is highly sensitive to $1/f$ flux noise. The Ramsey $(N=0)$ time is approximately 300 ns, and the Hahn echo $(N=1)$ time is approximately $1.5$ $\\mu \\mathrm{s}$. Increasing the number of CPMG pulses continues to increase the effective $T_2$ time towards the $2T_1$ limit. Adapted from Ref.\u00a0Bylander2011.\n\nConnecting $T_{\\varphi}$ to $S(\\omega)$\n\nIf the coupling to the qubit is instead longitudinal, e.g. $\\hat{H}_q$ is of the type $\\sigma_z$ or $a^{\\dagger}a$, the noise will stochastically modulate the transition frequency of the qubit and thereby  introduce a stochastic phase evolution of a qubit superposition state. This gradually leads to a loss of phase information, and it is therefore called pure dephasing (time constant $T_{\\varphi}$). Unlike $T_1$ relaxation, which is generally an irreversible (incoherent) error, pure dephasing $T_{\\varphi}$ is in principle reversible (a coherent error). The degree of pure dephasing depends on the control pulse sequence applied while the qubit is subject to the noise process.\n\nConsider the relative phase $\\varphi$ of a superposition state undergoing free evolution in the presence of noise.\nThe superposition state's accumulated phase,\n$$\n\n\\varphi(t) = \\int_0^t \\omega_{q} dt' = \\langle\\omega_{\\mathrm{q}}\\rangle t + \\delta\\varphi(t)\n\n$$\ndiffuses due to adiabatic fluctuations of the transition frequency,\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:del_phi_defn}\n\\delta\\varphi(t) = \\frac{\\partial \\freq}{\\partial \\lambda} \\int_0^t \\delta\\lambda(t')\\mathrm{d}t',\n\n$$\nwhere $\\partial \\freq / \\partial \\lambda = (1/\\hbar) |\\langle \\partial\\hat{H}_q / \\partial\\lambda \\rangle |$ is the qubit's longitudinal sensitivity to $\\lambda$-noise.\n\nFor noise generated by a large number of fluctuators that are weakly coupled to the qubit, its statistics are Gaussian.\nEnsemble averaging over all realizations of the Gaussian-distributed stochastic process $\\delta\\lambda(t)$,\n\nthe dephasing is\n$$\n\n\\label{eq:ens_avg_phase}\n\\langle e^{i\\,\\delta\\varphi(t)} \\rangle = e^{-\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\langle \\delta\\varphi^2(t) \\rangle} \\equiv e^{-\\chi_N(t)},\n\n$$\nleading to a coherence decay function,\n\n$$\n\n\\langle e^{- \\chi_N(\\tau)} \\rangle = \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\tau^2}{2} \\frac{\\partial \\freq}{\\partial\\lambda} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}g_N(\\omega,\\tau)S(\\omega)d\\omega\\right],\n\\label{Eq:PureDephasing}\n\n$$\n\nwhere $g(\\omega,\\tau)$ is a dimensionless weighting function.\n\nThe function $g_N(\\omega,\\tau)$ can be viewed as a frequency-domain filter of the noise $S_{\\lambda}(\\omega)$ [see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:CPMG)(a)].\nIn general, its filter properties depend on the number $N$ and distribution of applied pulses. For example, considering sequences of $\\pi$-pulses\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ],\n\n$$\n\\label{eq:filter_def}\ng_N(\\omega,\\tau) =\n\\frac{1}{(\\omega\\tau)^2} \\, \\Big| 1+(-1)^{1+N}\\exp(i\\omega\\tau) + \\\\\n2\\sum_{j=1}^{N} (-1)^j \\exp(i\\omega\\delta_j\\tau) \\cos(\\omega\\tau_\\pi/2) \\Big|^2 ,\n%   g=\\frac{|y_N(\\omega,\\tau)|^2}{(\\omega\\tau)^2},\n\n$$\n\nwhere $\\delta_j \\in [0,1]$ is the normalized position of the centre of the $j$th $\\pi$-pulse between the two $\\pi/2$-pulses, $\\tau$ is the total free-induction time, and $\\tau_\\pi$ is the length of each $\\pi$-pulse\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], yielding a total sequence length $\\tau + N\\tau_\\pi$.\n\nAs the number of pulses increases for fixed $\\tau$, the filter function's peak shifts to higher frequencies, leading to a reduction in the net integrated noise for $1/f^{\\alpha}$-type noise spectra with $\\alpha > 0$.\n\nSimilarly, for a fixed $N$, the filter function will shift in frequency with $\\tau$.\n\nAdditionally, for a fixed time separation $\\tau' = \\tau/N$ (valid for $N \\ge 1$), the filter sharpens and asymptotically peaks at $\\omega'/2\\pi = 1/2\\tau'$ as more pulses are added. $g_N(\\omega,\\tau)$ is thus called the \u201cfilter function\u201d\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], and it depends on the pulse sequences being applied.\n\nFrom Eq. (<ref>), the pure dephasing decay arises from a noise spectral density that is \u201cshaped\u201d or \u201cfiltered\u201d by the sequence-specific filter function. By choosing the number of pulses, their rotation axes, and their arrangement in time, we can design filter functions that minimize the net noise power for a given noise spectral density within the experimental constraints of the experiment (e.g., pulse-modulation bandwidth of the electronics used to control the qubits).\n\nTo give a standard example, we compare the coherence integral for two cases: a Ramsey pulse sequence and a Hahn echo pulse sequence. Both sequences involve two $\\pi/2$ pulses separated by a time $\\tau$, during which free evolution of the qubit occurs in the presence of low-frequency dephasing noise. The distinction is that the Hahn echo will place a single $\\pi$ pulse ($N=1$) in the middle of the free-evolution period, whereas the Ramsey does not use any additional pulses ($N=0$). The resulting filter functions are:\n\n$$\n\n%\\langle e^{- \\chi_N(\\tau)} \\rangle = \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\tau^2 \\nu^2}{2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}g(\\omega,\\tau)S(\\omega)d\\omega\\right],\ng_0(\\omega,\\tau) &= \\text{sinc}^2 \\frac{\\omega \\tau}{2} \\\\\ng_1(\\omega,\\tau) &= \\sin^2 \\frac{\\omega \\tau}{4} \\text{sinc}^2 \\frac{\\omega \\tau}{4}\n\n$$\n\nwhere the subscript $N=0$ and $N=1$ indicate the number of $\\pi$-pulses applied for the Ramsey and Hahn echo experiments, respectively. The filter function $g_0(\\omega,\\tau)$ for the Ramsey case is a sinc-function centered at $\\omega=0$. For noise that decreases with frequency, e.g., $1/f$ flux noise in superconducting qubits, the Ramsey experiment windows through the noise in $S(\\omega)$ where it has its highest value. This is the worst choice of filter function for $1/f$ noise. In contrast, the Hahn echo filter function has a centroid that is peaked at a higher frequency, away from $\\omega=0$. In fact, it has zero value at $\\omega=0$. For noise that decreases with frequency, such as $1/f$ noise, this is advantageous. This concept extends to larger numbers $N$ of $\\pi$ pulses, and is called a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:CPMG)(b), the $T_2$ time of a qubit under the influence of strong dephasing noise is increased toward the $2T_1$ limit using a CPMG dynamical error-suppression pulse sequence with an increasing number of pulses, $N$. We refer the reader to Refs.\u00a0Bylander2011,Gustavsson2012a,Gustavsson2012b, where these experiments were performed with superconducting qubits.\n\nNoise spectroscopy\n\nThe qubit is highly sensitive to its noisy environment, and this feature can be used to map out the noise power spectral density. In general, one can map the noise PSD during free evolution \u2013 periods of time for which no control is applied to the qubit, except for very short dynamical decoupling pulses \u2013 and during driven evolution \u2013 periods of time during which the control fields are applied to the qubit. Both free-evolution and driven-evolution noise is important to characterize, as the noise PSD may differ for these two types of evolution, and both are utilized in the context of universal quantum computation. We refer the reader to Ref.\u00a0Yan2013 for a summary of noise spectroscopy during both types of evolution.\n\nThe Ramsey frequency itself is sensitive to longitudinal noise, and monitoring its fluctuations is one means to map out the noise spectral density over the sub-millihertz to $\\sim100$ Hz range[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nAt higher frequencies, the CPMG dynamical decoupling sequence can be used to create narrow-band filters that \u201csample\u201d the noise at different frequencies as a function of the free-evolution time $\\tau$ and the number of pulses $N$. This has been used to map out the noise PSD in the range 0.1 - 300 MHz\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nOne must be careful of the additional small peaks at higher-frequencies, which all contribute to the dephasing used to perform the noise spectroscopy[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn fact, using pulse envelopes such as Slepians[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] \u2013 which are designed to have concentrated frequency response \u2013 to perform noise spectroscopy is one means to reduce such errors[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nAt even higher frequencies, measurements of $T_1$ can be used in conjunction with Fermi's golden rule to map out the transverse noise spectrum above 1 GHz\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe aforementioned are all examples of noise spectroscopy during free evolution. Noise spectroscopy during driven evolution was also demonstrated using a \u201cspin-locking\u201d technique, where a strong drive along $x$ or $y$ axes defines a new qubit quantization axis, whose Rabi frequency is the new qubit frequency in the spin-locking frame. The spin-locking frame is then used to infer the noise spectrum while the qubit is continually subject to a driving field. For more information, we refer the reader to Ref.\u00a0Yan2013."}

To assess whether this level of precision is sufficient to reliably prepare lattices of fixed-frequency transmons capable of error-correcting codes, we must quantify the frequency-crowding problem. Transmon qubits are weakly anharmonic and have decreasing transition energies at higher levels. Therefore, degeneracies among the $\\ket{0} \\rightarrow \\ket{1}$, $\\ket{1} \\rightarrow \\ket{2}$ and $\\ket{0} \\rightarrow \\ket{2}$ transitions of nearby qubits can all contribute to `frequency collisions.' We must consider the relative frequencies of both nearest-neighbors and next-nearest-neighbors in the lattice [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Fig (Figure fig:lattices_and_freqs) illustrates the relative positions of nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor qubits in a section of lattice, and <ref> lists the seven cases most likely to lead to gate errors [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. We can think of them qualitatively as follows: Type 1 causes hybridization of states in $Q_j$ and $Q_k$, while in type 2 the CR pulse excites $Q_j$ into the non-computational $\\ket{2}$ state. Type 3 excites $Q_k$ to the $\\ket{2}$ state, but does not require a CR tone. In condition 4, $ZX$ is weak, which implies long gate times and increased gate error [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In type 5, the CR gate addresses an additional neighboring qubit. In type 6, when one qubit is the target of a CR gate, its next-nearest-neighbor leaks to the $\\ket{2}$ state.

This breaks the frequency space into allowed and forbidden regions. Type 4 listed in <ref> defines forbidden zones where $ZX$ coupling is too low. For the other six conditions, we forbid regions where the `frequency collision' is the dominant source of gate error. Existing multi-qubit systems with CR gates typically exhibit two-qubit gate errors of 1 to 2\n\nA useful lattice of qubits should enable high quantum volume and fault-tolerant operation while avoiding all of the `frequency collisions' and forbidden regions presented in <ref>. Both lattice layout and the pattern of qubit frequencies are relevant. We consider three types of lattices: square, `heavy-square' and `heavy-hexagon' (<ref>). Lattices comprise qubits and two-qubit connections, each qubit being linked to no more than four neighbors. In many practical implementations, these links comprise microwave-resonant buses. A square lattice facilitates `surface code' fault-tolerant codes [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Recent literature describes hybrids of the surface code with Bacon-Shor type codes, which can be employed in `heavy hexagon' and `heavy square' lattices to achieve fault-tolerance, albeit with lower error thresholds than the surface code [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In addition to the data and ancilla qubit roles employed in the surface code, these hybrid codes assign a portion of the lattice as `flag' qubits.\n\nIn the square lattice, every qubit in the bulk of the lattice lies on a degree-four vertex, while some at edges have degree two or degree three. If we populate the square lattice with 5 distinct frequencies of qubits, $f_5 > f_4 > f_3 > f_2 > f_1$, with appropriate spacing between the frequencies, we can avoid all the forbidden regions of  <ref> [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In <ref>, we illustrate this pattern for square lattices capable of distance-5 ($d = 5$) rotated surface codes. Condition 4 of <ref> requires $f_{control} > f_{target}$, so the pattern also fixes the direction of CNOT gate for each pair.\n\nIn contrast to the square lattice, the `heavy square' lattice includes both degree-two and degree-four vertices in the bulk. Degree-one, -two or -three vertices appear at the edges. We take advantage of this pattern to make all the degree-two vertices control qubits, using a three-frequency pattern $f_3 > f_2 > f_1$. Since every control qubit (frequency $f_3$) is linked to at most two target qubits, we need only two properly-chosen target-qubit frequencies ($f_1$ and $f_2$) to satisfy conditions 5, 6 and 7 of <ref>, as shown in <ref>. A third type of lattice, the `heavy hexagon', uses a similar scheme. Here the bulk of the lattice includes degree-three and degree-two vertices. Additional degree-two and degree-one vertices lie at the edges. In this lattice, all of the `frequency collisions' and forbidden regions can be satisfied using only three frequencies $f_3 > f_2 > f_1$, with all control qubits residing on degree-two vertices with frequency $f_3$.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nLattice and frequency-pattern examples. Lattices are capable of $d=5$ codes. Patterns of qubit frequencies avoid all conditions in <ref>. Statistical model is applied to these examples and to equivalent lattices at $d = 3$ and $d = 7$. (See Supplementary Figures 1-9.) Square lattice includes 49 qubits in 5-frequency pattern. Heavy-square lattice includes 73 qubits in 3-frequency pattern. Heavy-hexagon lattice includes 65 qubits in 3-frequency pattern. In a portion of the heavy-hexagon lattice, we indicate qubits' intended gate roles: control (black circles) or target (white circles); as well as code roles: data (D), ancilla (A) or flag (F) [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].

We sample the qubits at random frequencies drawn from normal distributions characterized by $\\sigma_f$, and count the collisions defined in <ref>. (See <ref>.) In <ref>, we show the mean number of `frequency collisions' predicted by the Monte Carlo model for each lattice type and frequency pattern, as a function of $\\sigma_f$. As $\\sigma_f \\rightarrow 0$, the lattice approaches the ideal patterns of  <ref>, and has zero `frequency collisions'. As $\\sigma_f$ increases, the number of  `frequency collisions' rises steadily. As $\\sigma_f \\rightarrow f_{01} - f_{12}$, the different conditions appearing in <ref> all become likely, and a limiting number of `frequency collisions' is reached. Yield follows the inverse trend, as seen in <ref>. As $\\sigma_f$ increases, the likelihood of finding a `collision free' chip falls off sharply. While the step sizes between frequencies $f_1$ to $f_5$ are important, absolute frequency values are not. Setting $f_1= 5.0$, $f_2 = 5.07$ and $f_3 = 5.14$ GHz works as well as $f_1= 5.05$, $f_2 = 5.12$ and $f_3 = 5.19$ GHz.\n\nThe yield and mean collision number are a function of the several different collision types and bounds, so they are not readily susceptible to an analytic formulation. However, we can propose a simplified model for yield: in order for a lattice to be collision-free, every qubit in the lattice must fall within some frequency `window' $\\pm \\Delta f$ relative to its setpoint. Presuming the qubit frequencies are normally distributed, the probablity of this occurring goes as the cumulative distribution function, raised to the power $N$, where $N$ is the number of qubits: $\\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{(\\Delta f / \\sigma_f)} e^{-\\frac{1}{2} x^2} dx \\right]^N$. In the yield plot in <ref>, we fit this expression to find $\\Delta f$ for each lattice.\n\nThese model results allow us to predict how different lattice types and frequency patterns will respond to fabrication imprecision. As shown in <ref>, if imprecision $\\sigma_f$ is greater than 30 MHz, any $d = 5$ lattice will exhibit $>10$ `frequency collisions' of one or another of the types listed in <ref>, causing the affected gates to have error rates above $\\sim$ 1\n\nThe as-fabricated $\\sigma_f$ seen in <ref> is 132.3 MHz. (See <ref>) The Monte Carlo modeling finds that for a heavy-hexagon lattice at $d=3$ scale this $\\sigma_f$ can enable 0.1\n\nAs seen from the Monte Carlo analysis, the laser-anneal rework method can scale to the $>$ 100 qubit size, enabling a well-chosen lattice and frequency pattern to implement $d = 7$ error-correction codes free of frequency-crowding. To examine needs for the next generation of chips up to the 1000-qubit level, we can coarsely estimate requirements by extrapolating the fixed window model for the heavy-hexagon lattice as shown in <ref>. While the $\\sigma_f$ = 14.0 MHz demonstrated here enables practical yield up to the 100 to 200 qubit scale, it is clear that roughly a factor of two further improvement is needed to scale towards 1000 qubits. Since this precision is also better than the resistance-to-frequency prediction precision shown in this work, development of further refinements in tuning and frequency prediction approaches will be necessary as the scale of fixed-frequency transmon circuits surpass the 100 qubit milestone.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nYield scaling for heavy hexagon lattice.

The lengths of the cables are listed in Table (Table tab:DR) and correspond to the inter-plate distances in the dilution refrigerator plus a small correction due to the bends in those cables (see Section <ref>). Stainless steel cables (UT85-SS-SS) and NbTi cables (UT85-NbTi) have the lowest passive load. This is why we choose them for drive and output lines, respectively. The flows of these two cable types are dominated by their outer conductor, which has a cross-sectional area that is by a factor 10 larger than the center conductor. The contribution of the Teflon dielectric is of the same order of magnitude as the one of the inner conductor. This results from the low thermal conductivity of Teflon, see Appendix <ref>, and the cross-sectional area of the dielectric being comparable to the one of the outer conductor.\n\nAn alternative to stainless steel cable is Cupronickel (CuNi) cable.

{"prompt": "Explain the '## Systematic noise' section of the paper.", "completion": "Systematic noise arises from a process that is traceable to a fixed control or readout error. For example, we apply a microwave pulse to the qubit that we believe will impart a 180-degree rotation. However, the control field is not tuned properly and, rather than rotating the qubit 180 degrees, the pulse slightly over-rotates or under-rotates the qubit by a fixed amount. The underlying error is systematic, and it therefore leads to the same rotation error each time it is applied. However, when such erroneous pulses are used in practice in a variety of control sequences, the observed results may appear to be influenced by random noise. This is because the pulse is generally not applied in the same way for each experiment: it could be applied a different number of times, interspersed with different pulses in different orders, and therefore generally differs from experiment to experiment. However, once systematic errors are identified, they can generally be corrected through proper calibration or the use of improved hardware."}

{"prompt": "Explain the '# Randomized benchmarking' section of the paper.", "completion": "The schemes presented in the previous section fail in the presence of sizeable SPAM errors.\nIn the context of digital quantum computing, this sensibility to SPAM errors is dramatically reduced by so-called RB protocols [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThese protocols can extract certain  quantitative measures of a quantum process\nassociated to a quantum gate set.\nThe process can be, for example, a certain gate, an error channel or an error map associated to the deviation of a quantum gate set from its ideal implementation.\nWhile still concerned with the physical layer of a quantum device, randomized benchmarking protocols already make explicit use of a gate layer, the abstraction at the heart of digital quantum computing.\n\nRB comprises a large zoo of different protocols.\nTherefore, we begin with a fairly general description.\nThe principle idea to achieve the SPAM-(error) robustness is the following:\nafter preparing an input state, one applies the quantum process under scrutiny multiple times in sequences of different lengths before performing a measurement.\nThereby, the effect of the process on the measurement is attenuated with increasing sequences length.\nAt the same time, errors in the state preparation and measurements enter the measured quantities only linearly and are independent of the sequence length.\nIn this way, fitting the attained signals for different sequence lengths with functions depending on the length reveals properties of the quantum process disentangled from the SPAM errors.\n\nA prototypical RB protocol implements this rough idea for\na digital quantum computer as follows.\nLet $\\gset \\subset \\U(d)$ be a subgroup of unitary operations and $\\phi: \\gset \\to \\M(\\CC^d)$ be their implementation on a quantum computer.\nIn simple RB protocols $\\phi(g)$ just models the faulty implementation of $\\mcG$ on the actual device.\nMore generally, the targeted implementation of the protocol can also include, e.g., a non-uniform sampling over the group or the implementation of another fixed gate after $\\mcG$.\nAlso in these cases $\\phi$ is the faulty version of the targeted implementation.\n\nNote that the assumption of the existence of such a map $\\phi$ already encodes assumptions on the quantum device and its noise process:\nthe map $\\phi$ might model the compilation into elementary gates, effects and imperfections of the physical control, and noise.\nAll these steps are not allowed to depend on the gate sequence the gate is part of, the overall time that evolves during the protocol, or other external variables.\nThis noise can in particular be described as context-independent and Markovian.\n\nWith these ingredients we can state a prototypical RB protocol,\nsee Figure\u00a0(Figure fig:RB) for an illustration.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nIllustration of a prototypical RB protocol.\nAfter the preparation of an initial state, one applies a random sequence of unitaries\n$g = (g_1, \\ldots , g_m)$ succeeded by an inversion gate and final measurement of $M$.\nThis experiment is repeated for different sequences and different sequence lengths $m$.\nIn the classical postprocessing, the decay parameter of resulting empirical estimates for different sequence lengths m are extracted and reported as the RB parameters.\n[label=protocol:standardRB]Prototypical RB\nLet $\\gset  \\subset \\U(d)$ be a subgroup,\n$\\rho \\in \\DM(\\CC^d)$ an initial state, and\n$\\mset = \\{\\mop, \\1-\\mop\\}\\subset

the\nsequence of  implementations of $g$ followed by the implementation of $g_\\text{inv}$, to $\\rho$.\n\n*  Perform the measurement $\\mset$.\n\nMultiple repetitions of the experiment yield an estimator $\\hat p_g$ for\nthe probabilities\n$$\n\\label{eq:RB:p_g}\np_g(m) = \\Tr\\left[M S_g \\rho\\right]\n\n$$\n\nRepeating these steps for different random sequences, we can calculate an estimator $\\hat p(m)$ for\n$$\n\np(m) = \\EE_{g_1}\\EE_{g_2} \\cdots \\EE_{g_m} p_{(g_1, g_2, \\ldots g_m)}(m).\n\n$$\n\nPost-processing: extract the decay parameters of the data $\\mathfrak M \\to [0,1]$, $m \\mapsto \\hat p(m)$ and report as the\nRB parameters.\n\nMore generally, RB protocols might go beyond Protocol\u00a0<ref> in various ways: for example, by calculating the inverse of a sequence only up to specific gates, using a different measure than the uniform measure for drawing the group elements of the sequence, or performing a measurement POVM with multiple outputs or measurements adapted to the sequence.\nIn addition, the post-processing might combine different RB data series in order to get simpler decay signatures.\n\nThe first step in the theoretical analysis of RB protocols is to establish the fitting model of the RB data $p(m)$.\nIdeally, $p(m)$ is well-approximated by a single exponential decay.\nSubsequently, the RB decay parameters can in certain settings be connected to the average gate fidelity of a noise process effecting the implementation map, as we now discuss.\n\nThe data model of most RB protocols can be understood as estimating the $m$-fold self-convolution of the implementation map [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nMore precisely, for $\\phi, \\psi: \\gset \\to \\M(\\CC^d)$ we can define a convolution operation as\n$$\n\\label{eq:RB:convolution}\n\\phi \\ast \\psi(g) = \\EE_{\\tilde g} \\phi(g {\\tilde g}^{-1})\\psi(\\tilde g).\n\n$$\nNote that this definition naturally generalizes, e.g., the discrete circular convolution on vectors in $\\CC^n$, which can be seen as an operation on functions on the finite group $(\\ZZ_n, +) \\to \\mathbb \\CC$.\nWith the convolution (<ref>), we can rewrite the averages of the RB sequences as\n$$\n\n\\EE_{g} S_g &= \\EE_{g_1, g_2, \\ldots, g_m}\n\\phi(g_1^{-1}g_2^{-1} \\cdots g_m^{-1})\\phi(g_m) \\cdots \\phi(g_2)\\phi(g_1)\n\\nonumber\\\\ \\nonumber\n&=

g_j h_{j-1}$ for $j\\in \\{2, \\dots, m\\}$ have been made the second equality,\n$\\id$ denotes the identity element of $\\gset{}$ and $\\phi^{\\ast k}$ denotes the $k$-fold convolution of $\\phi$ with itself.\nIn expectation the RB data $p(m)$ is thus a contraction defined by $M$ and $\\rho$ of the $(m+1)$-fold self-convolution of $\\phi$ evaluated at the identity element.\n\nIn the simplest instance of an RB protocol one can directly calculate this expression:\nnamely, when $\\gset{}$ is a unitary $2$-design, the targeted implementation is simply the action of $\\gset{}$ as quantum gates, and the noise in $\\phi$ can be modeled by a single gate-independent quantum channel $\\Lambda \\in \\CPT(\\CC^d)$.\nDenoting by $\\mathcal G$ the (adjoint) action of $g$ as the unitary channel $X \\mapsto \\mathcal G (X) = g X g^\\ad$,\nwe have the noise model\n$$\n\\label{eq:gate_indep_noise}\n\\phi(g) = \\Lambda \\circ \\mcG \\,.\n\n$$\nWith this ansatz for $\\phi$ we can calculate that\n$$\n\\label{eq:RB:convolution2Design}\n\\EE_{g \\in {\\gset^m}} S_g = \\phi^{\\ast(m + 1)}(\\id) = \\Lambda \\left[\\EE_{g \\in \\gset} \\mcG^\\dagger \\Lambda \\mcG \\right]^m.\n\n$$\n\nThe

isomorphisms.\nRecall that for a unitary $2$-design $\\mu$ Proposition\u00a0<ref> gives us an explicit description of $\\mo^{(2)}_\\mu$.\nWe can track the isomorphism to derive the following convenient expression.\n\n[label=thm:channel-twirling]Twirling of channels [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\nLet $\\X \\in \\M(\\CC^d)$ be trace-preserving

$\\X$ is trace-preserving so is $\\tw_\\mu(\\X)$.\nHence, $\\tw_\\mu(\\X)$ is an affine combination of $\\depol[0]$ and $\\depol[1]$.\nThus,\n$\\tw_\\mu(\\X) = \\depol[p]$ holds for some $p \\in \\CC$ and it remains to determine $p$.\nOne way forward is a straight-forward calculation using the expressions for the coefficients provided by Proposition\u00a0<ref>.\nA shortcut is to calculate the effective depolarization of both sides.\nDue to the unitary invariance of $\\mu_{\\sphereCd}$, it follows from\n(<ref>) that\n$\\agf(\\X) = \\agf(\\tw(\\X))$\nand correspondingly for the affinely related effective depolarization parameter that $p(\\X) = p(\\tw(\\X))$.\nCombined with $p(\\depol[p]) = p$ from Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) yields the theorem's assertion.\n\nTheorem\u00a0<ref> allows us to explicitly calculate the RB data model from Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).\nTo this end, a short calculation reveals that $\\depol^m = \\depol[p^m]$.\nWith this we find\nthe RB data model to be\n$$\n\\label{eq:RBdata_derivation}\n\\begin{aligned}\np(m)\n&=\n\\Tr[\\tilde M\\Lambda \\depol[p(\\Lambda)^m] (\\tilde \\rho)]\n\\\\\n&=\np(\\Lambda)^m \\Tr[\\tilde M\\Lambda(\\tilde \\rho)] +

and $\\tilde \\rho$ denoting the potentially faulty implementation of the measurement $M$ and initial state $\\rho$.\nIn terms of the so-called SPAM constants\n$$\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nA &\\coloneqq \\Tr[\\tilde M\\Lambda(\\tilde \\rho-\\1/d)] \\, ,\n\\\\\nB &\\coloneqq \\Tr[\\tilde M\\Lambda(\\1/d)] \\, ,\n\\end{aligned}\n\n$$\nwe obtain the simple RB fitting model\n$$\n\\label{eq:RB_fitting}\np(m) = A\\, p^m + B\\, .\n\n$$\nThus, fitting a single exponential decay to the estimator $\\hat p(m)$ yields estimates $\\hat p$, $\\hat A$ and $\\hat B$ for the model parameters $p$, $A$ and $B$.\nIn particular,\nthe estimated RB decay parameter $\\hat p$ is an estimator for the effective depolarizing parameter $p(\\Lambda)$ of the error channel $\\Lambda$.\nRecall that the effective depolarizing parameter is affinely related to the average gate fidelity (<ref>) via Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).\nFrom the RB decay parameter, we thus equivalently obtain an estimate for the average gate fidelity of the noise channel $\\Lambda$ as\n$$\n\\label{eq:RB:AGFestimation}\n\\hatagf\n= \\left(1 - \\frac1d\\right) \\hat p + \\frac1d.\n\n$$\nNote that the resulting estimate of the average gate fidelity (<ref>) is indeed robust against SPAM errors, which only enter the SPAM constants $A$ and $B$.\n\nDeriving rigorous performance guarantees for the estimator RB estimator $\\hat p$ is involved: it requires the analysis of confidence regions of the estimator $\\hat p_g(m)$ of the probability (<ref>) that is a random variable of the quantum measurement statistics and $\\hat p(m)$ obtained by the subsampling of the sequences $g$.\nFurthermore, the error of these estimators for each $m$ enters the errors of the fidelity estimator via the exponential fitting procedure.\nThis step depends on the choice of algorithm and the estimated sequence lengths.\n\nUsing the fact that $\\hat p(m)$ is the mean estimator of a bounded random variable, one can use Hoeffding's inequality (Theorem\u00a0<ref>)\nto derive confidence intervals for an overall sampling complexity that is independent of the number of qubits in the regime of high fidelity.\nSuch bounds however are prohibitively large for practical implementations.\nA refined analysis by Wallman and Flammia [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] derived tighter  bounds for short sequences and small number of qubits.\nHowever, bounds that are practical and scalable in the number of qubits require a careful analysis of the variance of the estimator $\\hat p_g(m)$ over the choice of the random sequences.\nFor $\\gset{}$ being the Clifford group, Helsen et al. [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] work out explicit variance bounds for the estimator $\\hat p_g(m)$ and derived sampling complexities for $\\hat p(m)$ that are practical, independent of the number of qubits and scale favorable with the sequence length.\nTo this end,\nthey\nemployed a refined representation theoretical analysis of the commutant of the $4$-th order diagonal action of the Clifford group [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] in order to calculate the corresponding moment operator; an endeavor that is complicated by the fact that the Clifford group itself is not a unitary $4$-design.\n\nA rigorous analysis of a simplified fitting procedure was derived in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nTherein (again using trivial bounds on the variance) the authors show that a ratio estimator for the infidelity $r = 1 - p$ that employs the estimates of $p(m)$ for two different sequence length has multiplicative error using an efficient number of samples again in the regime of high fidelity.\n\nAll of these performance guarantees indicate that in principle RB protocols can be efficiently scalable in the number of qubits.\nTo ensure also an efficient classical pre-processing of the prototypical RB protocol it is\nimportant to have an efficiently tractable group structure so that the inverse of the gate sequence can be computed.\n\nFor the important example of the Clifford group, the Gottesman-Knill theorem, see e.g. Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], allows the efficient computation the inverse of a sequence $g_m \\cdots g_2 g_1$ in polynomial time (w.r.t. the number of qubits).\nFurthermore, since the Clifford group is a unitary $3$-design [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ],\nit meets the requirement of Theorem\u00a0<ref>.\nFor this reason the presented analysis applies to the Clifford group under the assumption of gate-independent noise.\n\nIt is natural to ask of additional examples\nof groups that constitute a unitary $2$-design and are covered by the presented analysis without modifications.\nBut it has been established that these two requirements are already surprisingly restrictive. A complete classification of so-called $2$-groups ($2$-design groups) is summarized in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nIn fact, if one requires a family of $2$-groups that can be constructed for an arbitrary number of qubits, one is left with subgroups of the Clifford group or $\\SU(d)$ itself as the only examples [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nWe provide more details how the analysis of the prototypical RB protocol can be generalized in the further-reading paragraph at the end of the section.\nNow, we want to discuss another variant of RB that is particularly important as tool for certifying quantum gates.\n\nInterleaved randomized benchmarking\n\nThe prototypical RB protocol yields estimates of the effective depolarizing parameter or the average gate fidelity of the average error channel of a gate set.\nIn contrast, interleaved RB protocols  [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] allow one to extract the effective depolarizing parameter of individual gates from a group with respect to their ideal implementation provided the noise is sufficiently incoherent.\n\nIn an interleaved RB protocol one performs in addition to\nthe standard RB protocol a modified version, where the random sequences\nare interleaved with the specific target gate.\nThe second experiment yields estimates for the effective depolarization parameter of the error channel associated to the group concatenated\nwith the error channel of the individual target gate.\nUnder certain assumptions the effective depolarization parameter of the implementation of the target gate can\nbe estimated from the decay parameters of both RB protocols.\n\n[label=protocol:modifiedRB]Interleaved RB\nFor $\\gset\\subset \\U(d)$ and a target gate $\\gt\\in \\gset$\n\n*  follow Protocol\u00a0<ref>,\n\n*  follow Protocol\u00a0<ref> but modify the sequences to be\n$$\n\ng = (g_1, \\gt, g_2, \\gt, g_3, \\ldots, \\gt , g_m),\n\n$$\nwhere $\\gt$ is the target gate and $g_i \\in \\gset$ for $i \\in [m]$ are drawn uniformly at random.\nThe inverse $g_\\text{inv}$ is also calculated w.r.t. the modified sequence $g$.\n\nThe output of the protocol are the decay parameters of both experiments.\n\nFor the analysis we again consider a `mostly' gate-independent noise model and assume that $\\gset$ is a unitary $2$-design.\nIn the noise model we assume that the same noise channel\n$\\Lambda \\in \\CPT(\\H)$\nfollows the ideal implementation of all gates but the target gate, i.e.,\n$$\n\\label{eq:tildeG}\n\\phi(g) = \\Lambda \\circ \\mathcal G\n\n$$\nfor all $ g \\in \\gset \\setminus \\{\\gt\\}$.\n\nThe first step of the protocol is the unmodified RB protocol.\nIf we neglect that $\\phi$ deviates from the form Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) on $\\gt$,\nwe can apply the analysis of the previous section for gate-independent noise and\nconclude that the protocol outputs and estimator for the effective depolarizing constant $p(\\Lambda)$.\nFor example, for a large group it is plausible to neglect the contribution of the noise associated to the $\\gt$ gate to the group average.\n\nIt remains to analyze the second protocol.\nIn analogy to Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) we can in general rewrite\n\n_g_1, \u2026, g_m   S_g\n\n= _g_1, \u2026, g_m   \u03d5(g_1^-1^-1g_2^-1^-1\u2026 g_m^-1)\n\u00d7\u03d5(g_m) \u03d5() \u2026\u03d5(g_2) \u03d5() \u03d5(g_1)\n\n= _g_1, \u2026, g_m   \u03d5(g_m^-1)\u2026\n\u00d7\u03d5(g_3g_2^-1^-1)\u03d5()\u03d5(g_2g_1^-1^-1)\u03d5()\u03d5(g_1),\n\nby substituting $g_i$ with $g_i g_{i-1}^{-1} \\gt^{-1}$ for all $i > 1$.\n\nInserting the noise model\u00a0(<ref>) yields\n$$\n\\begin{split}\n\\EE_{g_1, \\ldots, g_m} S_g %\n= \\Lambda \\left[%\n\\EE_{g \\in \\gset{}}\\,%\n\\mcG^\\ad \\Gt^\\ad \\phi(\\gt)\\Lambda\\mcG%\n\\right]^m%\n\\end{split}\n$$\n\nThis is the same expression as Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) with $\\Lambda$ replaced by $\\Gt^\\ad \\phi(\\gt) \\Lambda$.\nHence, applying the same arguments as in the analysis of the standard RB protocol for unitary $2$-designs yields\na single-exponential fitting model with\ndecay parameter estimating the effective depolarizing parameter $p(\\Gt^\\ad\\phi(\\gt) \\Lambda)$.\nThe second part of the interleaved RB protocol, thus, yields an estimate of the effective depolarizing parameter or equivalently, via Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), of the fidelity of the error map $\\Gt^\\ad\\phi(\\gt)$ of the target gate $\\Gt$ concatenated with the error channel $\\Lambda$.\n\nFrom $p(\\Lambda)$ and $p(\\Gt^\\ad\\phi(\\gt)\\Lambda)$ it is indeed possible to infer $p(\\Gt^\\ad\\phi(\\gt))$.\nIn meaningful practical regimes this however requires additional control the unitarity of $\\Lambda$ [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]:\nfor sequences of unitary channels the infidelity of their composition can scale quadratically in the sequence length in leading order.\nIn contrast, highly non-unitary channels will feature a close to linear scaling in the sequence length.\nThus, using the unitary one can derive bounds for fidelity measures of\ncomposite channels that exploit the linear scaling.\nWe simply state the required bound without proof for interleaved RB:\n[label=thm:comp-channel-bound,fonttitle=]Composite channel bound [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\nFor any two quantum channels $\\mc X, \\mc Y$ it holds that\n$$\n\\label{eq:comp-channel-bound}\n\\left| p(\\mc X)\n- \\frac\n{p(\\mc X\\mc Y)p(\\mc Y)}\n{u(\\mc Y)}\n\\right|\n\\leq\n\\sqrt{\n1 - \\frac\n{p(\\mc Y)^2}\n{u(\\mc Y)}\n}\n\\sqrt{\n1 - \\frac\n{p(\\mc X \\mc Y)^2}\n{u(\\mc Y)}\n}\n\n$$\n\nWith an estimate for the unitarity $\\hat u(\\Lambda)$, Theorem\u00a0<ref> allows the estimation of the effective depolarizing constant and thus the average gate fidelity of the target gate by\n$$\n\n\\hatagf(\\phi(\\gt), \\Gt)\n=\n\\frac{d - 1}d \\, \\frac{\\hat p(\\Gt^\\ad \\phi(\\gt))\\hat p(\\Lambda)}{\\hat u^{\\Lambda}} + \\frac1d\n\n$$\nup to a systematic error that is given by evaluating the right-hand side of Eq.\u00a0(<ref>).\nThe systematic error is small in the regime where $u(\\Lambda) \\approx p(\\Lambda)^2$ which is the case if $\\Lambda$ is decoherent.\nThe unitarity of $\\Lambda$ can be estimated using variants of the RB protocol itself developed in Refs.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nAlternatively, one can just assume that the error is sufficiently incoherent, i.e. that $| 1 - p(\\Lambda)^2 / u(\\Lambda)| \\leq \\epsilon$.\nConditioned on this external belief, one obtains the simpler estimator\n$$\n\n\\hatagf(\\phi(\\gt), \\Gt)\n=\n\\frac{d - 1}d \\, \\frac{\\hat p(\\Gt^\\ad \\phi(\\gt))}{\\hat p(\\Lambda)} + \\frac1d\n\n$$\nthat comes with a systematic error that is controlled in $\\epsilon$.\nThereby, interleaved RB can be used to arrive at average-performance certificates of individual quantum gates.\n\nWe have already seen that for interleaved RB controlling the unitarity is helpful in deriving tighter error bounds.\nIn addition, estimating the unitarity can also yield relevant worst-case performance bounds in terms of the average gate fidelities using Theorem\u00a0<ref>.\n\nFurther reading\n\nRandomized benchmarking was originally developed in a series of work focusing on the unitary group and Clifford gates [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe early analyses used the gate-independent noise model (<ref>), which we also assume here.\nIn many applications this is however a questionable assumption.\nAfter first perturbative approaches to derive the RB signal model under gate-dependent noise by Magesan et al.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and Proctor et al.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], Wallman rigorously derived the fitting model for unitary $2$-designs in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nUsing the elegant description of the RB data as the $m$-fold convolution of the implementation map, recently proposed by Merkel et al.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], one can abstractly understand the result as follows: as the standard discrete circular convolution, the convolution operator of maps on a group can be turned into a (matrix) multiplication using a Fourier transform.\nThis abstract Fourier transform for functions on the group is defined to be a function on the irreducible representations of the group.\nIn the case of RB, this function is matrix-valued, and we observe matrix powers of the Fourier transforms for every irreducible representation superimposed by a linear map.\nFor every irreducible representation, for sufficiently large $m$, the matrix powers are proportional to the $m$-th power of the largest eigenvalue of the matrix-valued Fourier transformation. Contributions from other eigenvalues are suppressed.\nIn this sense RB is akin to the power method of numerical linear algebra but in Fourier space [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nA rigorous analysis requires to perturbatively bound the contribution of the subleading eigenvalues.\nFor unitary $2$-groups the adjoint representation decomposes into two irreducible representations,\nthe trace representation and the unital part of the quantum channel. For close to trace-preserving maps the trace representation will only contribute a very slow decay, i.e. a constant contribution to the fitting model, and the RB decay parameter is the dominant eigenvalue of the unital representation.\nWallman [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] derived norm bounds for the contribution of subleading eigenvalues and showed that the contribution is exponentially suppressed with the sequence length.\nFurthermore, Wallman showed that there is a gauge choice of the gate set such that the decay parameter can be connected to the average gate fidelity of the average error channel over the gate set.\nFor qubits this gauge was demonstrated to yield a physical gate set by Carignan-Dugas et al.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThe physicality of this gauge is, however, in general not guaranteed and a counter example is given by Helsen et al.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nAs discussed by Proctor et al.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], this complicates the interpretation of the RB decay rates as related to average fidelities that have a clear physically interpretation.\n\nWhile the Clifford gates are definitely a prominent use case in the benchmarking of digital quantum computers, more flexible RB protocols require analyzing groups that are not a unitary $2$-design.\n\nRandomized benchmarking protocols for other groups were developed in Refs.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThese protocols, for example, allow inclusion of the $T$-gate in the gate set [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] or characterization of leakage between qubit registers by using tensor copies of the Clifford group [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nAs the adjoint representation of other groups typically decomposes into multiple irreducible representation, RB data is expected to feature multiple decays in general.\nFor a description of a flexible post-processing scheme for general RB type data and performance guarantees see Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn order to isolate the different decays, multiple RB variants have been developed.\nThese either rely on directly preparing a state that has high overlap with only one irreducible representation or cleverly combining data from different RB experiments to achieve the same effect.\nMany of these techniques can be understood as variants of the character benchmarking protocol developed by Helsen et al.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nCharacter benchmarking uses inversions of the RB sequence not to the identity but randomly drawn gates from the group.\nIn the classical post-processing data sequences of different end gates are linearly combined by weighting them according to the character formulas.\nThereby, the data is projected onto the irreducible representation of the respective character and can be subsequently fitted by a single decay.\n\nInterleaved RB was proposed in Refs.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and demonstrated in practice.\nAlready standard RB provides a trivial bound for individual gates of the group by simply\nattributing the average error to a single gate.\nIn the original proposal of interleaved RB, the analysis\ndoes not allow for rigorous certificates that go significantly beyond this trivial bound for\nfew qubits [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nA general bound by Kimmel et al.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], was considerably refined using the unitarity by Carignan-Dugas et al.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThereby it was established that if the error channel is sufficiently incoherent interleaved RB yields\nrigorous certificates for individual gates with reasonable error bars.\nThere exist multiple variants of the interleaved RB scheme [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nAnother class of interleaved RB was introduced in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Here, the average gate fidelity of individual gates is inferred from measurements of random sequences of gates that are drawn from the symmetry group of the gate. The individual gates are not part of the group itself and are also not included in the inversion of the sequence.\n\nAnother practically very interesting variation of RB arises when one does not draw the gates from the uniform but another distribution over the group [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nFor example, drawing the sequences randomly from the generating gates of the group, reduces the required sequence lengths [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nOther quantities that can be measured by variants of the RB protocols are the unitarity [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], measures for the losses, leakage, addressability and cross-talk [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Furthermore, RB of operations on the logical level of an error correcting quantum architecture was proposed in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nCombining different relative average gate fidelities obtained by interleaved RB schemes can be used to acquire tomographic information about the error channel providing actionable advise to an experimentalist beyond a mere benchmarking and certification [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nUsing SPAM-robust data, these tomography schemes are in addition resource optimal for the unitary gates [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] and Clifford gates [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nFor Pauli channels tomographic information can be efficiently obtained performing a character RB protocol on multiple qubits simultaneously [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nA general framework with few theorems that establishes the RB fitting model of essentially all known RB schemes under gate-dependent noise is developed in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nThe central assumption employed therein to control contributions from subdominant eigenvalues of the Fourier transformation is a closeness condition to a reference representation in diamond norm averaged over all group elements.\nMoreover, a unifying review of RB is provided."}

(<ref>) constitutes our ideal scenario for an amplifier process. However, the problem is that that this relation does not satisfy the commutation relation in Eq. (<ref>). To satisfy this relation, we need to also take into account the vacuum fluctuations of another mode[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] \u2013 called the idler mode $b_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}$, also satisfying the same communtation relation $[b_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}},b_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}^{\\dagger}] = 1$. To satisfy the commutation relation, the idler mode is amplified by the gain factor $\\sqrt{G-1}$. For large gain, it can be shown that a minimum amount of half a photon of noise $\\hbar \\omega/2$ needs to be added to a signal amplified with gain $\\sqrt{G}$.\n\nFinally, taking the idler mode into account, the scattering relation for the coherent output field takes the form\n\n$$\n\na_{\\mbox{\\tiny{out}}} = \\underbrace{\\sqrt{G}a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{Amplification}}} + \\underbrace{\\sqrt{G - 1}b_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}^{\\dagger}}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{Added idler noise}}}.\n\\label{Eq:GainRelation}\n\n$$\n\nGenerally, this process results in a so-called phase-insensitive parametric amplification process, in which both quadratures of the input field gets equally amplified. This is illustrated in Fig. <ref>, where the in-phase ($I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}$) and quadrature ($Q_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}$) components of the fields are plotted, before and after the parametric amplifier.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nSchematic illustration of a quantum-limited, phase-preserving parametric amplification process of a coherent input state, $a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}} = I_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}} + iQ_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}$.

(b) Scattering representation of parametric mixing, where the signal and pump photons are interacting via a purely dispersive nonlinear medium. (c) In the case of phase-preserving amplification, both quadratures get amplified by a factor $\\sqrt{G}$, while (in the ideal case) half a photon of noise gets added to the output distribution (blue). Image inspired by Flurin[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nConsidering the amplification process in Eq. (<ref>), we can find a special case for the idler mode, for which noiseless amplification can be accomplished for one of the two quadratures, but at the expense of adding more noise to the other, thus not violating Heisenberg's uncertainty relation for the two field quadratures. This mode of operation is known as phase-sensitive amplification, and is obtained when the idler mode oscillates at the same frequency as the signal (or a multiple thereof), but can be shifted with an overall phase $\\phi \\in [0,2\\pi]$. By substituting the idler mode in Eq. (<ref>) with $b_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}} = e^{i\\phi}a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}$, the scattering relation becomes\n\n$$\n\na_{\\mbox{\\tiny{out}}} = \\underbrace{\\sqrt{G}a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{Amplification}}} + \\underbrace{e^{-i\\phi}\\sqrt{G - 1}a_{\\mbox{\\tiny{in}}}^{\\dagger}}_{\\mbox{\\tiny{Phase-dep. noise}}}.\n\\label{Eq:GainRelation2}\n\n$$\n\nThe overall phase factor allows us to tune the orientation of the amplification (or de-amplification) by means of the pump phase, thus allowing us to choose a quadrature for which we want to reduce the noise, see Fig. <ref>. Intuitively, this can be understood by considering the interference that occurs when two waves with the same frequency are confined in space, where we obtain constructive or destructive interference, depending on the phase between the two waves. Due to this interference, the noise can be suppressed even below the standard quantum limit (without violating Heisenberg's uncertainty relation). This is known as single-mode squeezing and was first observation in superconducting circuits by Yurke et al.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In particular, after the theoretical prediction by Gardiner[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], Murch et al. showed that the coherence time of a qubit can be enhanced when the qubit is exposed to squeezed vacuum[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Also two-mode squeezing was demonstrated by Eichler et al.[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], where the demodulation setup squeezes both quadratures of the acquired signal[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn the context of qubit readout, however, phase-sensitive amplification tends to be experimentally inconvenient. This is mainly due to its phase-dependent gain, which imposes stringent requirements on continuous phase-calibration of the readout signal.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\nPhase-sensitive parametric amplification.

It was shown that\nin this case the suppression factor $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})/\\Gamma (0)$ is\napproximately $[(1+\\bar{n}/n_{\\rm crit})^{-1/2}+(1+\\bar{n}/n_{\\rm\ncrit})^{-1}]^2$ instead of the factor $(1+\\bar{n}/n_{\\rm\ncrit})^{-1}$ expected from the ac Stark shift, where $\\bar{n}$ is\nthe mean number of photons in the resonator and $n_{\\rm crit}\\equiv\n(\\Delta_{\\rm rq}/2g)^2$. This difference results in the ratio $3/2$\nbetween the corresponding slopes of $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})$ at small\n$\\bar{n}$, with the ac Stark shift model underestimating the Purcell\nrate suppression (see the blue lines in Fig. (Figure: Purcell relaxation time versus qubit-resonator detuning  for g/2\u03c0=86MHz)). However, when the third level of the qubit is taken into account, then the ac Stark shift model describes correctly the slope of $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})$ at small $\\bar{n}$  when the qubit anharmonicity is relatively small, $|\\delta_{\\rm q}/\\Delta_{\\rm rq}| \\ll 1$ (see Appendix). In this case the ac Stark shift model predicts $\\Gamma\n(\\bar{n})/\\Gamma (0)=1+4 \\bar{n}\\chi (0) /\\Delta_{\\rm rq}$ at\n$\\bar{n}\\ll n_{\\rm crit}$, where $\\chi (0)$ is the value of $\\chi$ at $\\bar{n}=0$; note that $|\\chi (0)| \\ll |g^2/\\Delta_{\\rm rq}|$ and $\\chi (0) <0$ when\n$\\Delta_{\\rm rq}> 0$.\n\nWith the filter resonator, we also expect that the ac Stark shift\nmodel for the Purcell rate suppression should work reasonably well,\nso that from Eq.

The numerical simulations used the two-level approximation for the qubit, for which $\\bar{n}/|\\Delta_{\\rm rq}/\\chi (0)|=\\bar{n}/4n_{\\rm crit}$. The dashed lines show the values expected from the model based on the ac Stark shift: $\\Gamma ({\\bar n})/\\Gamma (0)=(1+{\\bar n}/n_{\\rm crit})^{-2}$ with the filter and $(1+{\\bar n}/n_{\\rm crit})^{-1}$ without the filter. The parameters used in the simulations are given in the text.\n\nTo check the accuracy of this formula numerically, we need to add into the Hamiltonian (<ref>) the terms describing the drive and higher levels in the qubit (see Appendix). However, the resulting Hilbert space was too large for our numerical simulations, so we numerically calculated $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})$ using only the two-level approximation for the qubit. Using the rotating frame based on the drive frequency $\\omega_{\\rm d}$ [i.e., $H_0=\\omega_{\\rm d}(\\sigma_+\\sigma_- +a^\\dagger a+ b^\\dagger b)$], we then obtain the interaction Hamiltonian\n$$\n\\label{h}\nV_{\\rm d}&=\\Delta_{\\rm rd}a^{\\dag}a+\\Delta_{\\rm fd}b^{\\dag}b+ \\Delta_{\\rm qd} \\sigma_+\\sigma_- +\\textit{g}(a^{\\dag}\\sigma_{-}+a\\sigma_{+})\\notag\\\\\n&+\\mathcal{G}a^{\\dag}b+ \\mathcal{G}^*ab^{\\dag} +\\varepsilon_{\\rm r} a^{\\dag}\n+ \\varepsilon_{\\rm r}^* a,\n\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_{\\rm rd}=\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}-\\omega_{\\rm d}$,  $\\Delta_{\\rm fd}=\\omega_{\\rm f}-\\omega_{\\rm d}$, $\\Delta_{\\rm qd}=\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}-\\omega_{\\rm d}$, and for simplicity we assumed that the drive $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$\nis applied to the readout resonator. (For the rotating wave approximation we also need to assume that $|\\Delta_{\\rm rd}|$, $|\\Delta_{\\rm fd}|$, $|\\Delta_{\\rm qd}|$, $|g|$, $|\\mathcal{G}|$, and $|\\dot{\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}}/\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}|$ are all small compared with $\\omega_{\\rm d}$.) Note that in the two-level\napproximation $[\\omega_{\\rm r}-\\omega_{\\rm q,eff} (\\bar{n}) ]^2\n=\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^2+4g^2\\bar{n}=\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^2 (1+\\bar{n}/n_{\\rm\ncrit})$.\n\nWe have numerically solved the full master equation with the\nHamiltonian (<ref>), including the decay $\\kappa_{\\rm f}$ of the\nfilter resonator. As the initial state we use the excited state for\nthe qubit and vacuum for the two resonators, $|\\psi\\rangle_{\\rm\nin}=|e00\\rangle$. The Purcell rate is extracted from the numerical\nsolution of $\\rho_{ee}(t)$ by fitting $-\\ln[\\rho_{ee}(t)]$ with a\nlinear function in the long time limit (still requiring $1-\\rho_{ee}(t)\\ll 1$). In the simulations we pump\nthe readout resonator with the frequency $\\omega_{\\rm d}=\\omega_{\\rm\nr}^{|e\\rangle}$ and control $\\bar{n}$ by\nchoosing the corresponding value of $\\varepsilon_{\\rm r}$. The value of $\\bar{n}$ is calculated numerically; it is close to what is expected from the solution of the classical field equations when the $n$-dependence of $\\chi$ and $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}$ is taken into account: in the two-level approximation $\\chi({\\bar n})=-g^2/[\\Delta_{\\rm rq}\\sqrt{1+4g^2{\\bar n}/\\Delta_{\\rm rq}^2}]$ and $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}=\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}+\\chi ({\\bar n})$. Since $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{|e\\rangle}$ changes with $\\bar n$, we change $\\omega_{\\rm d}$ accordingly.\n\nThe red solid line in Fig.  (Figure: Purcell relaxation time versus qubit-resonator detuning  for g/2\u03c0=86MHz) shows the numerical results for the Purcell rate suppression factor $\\Gamma (\\bar{n})/\\Gamma (0)$ as a function of $\\bar n=\\bar{n}^{|e\\rangle}$, normalized by $|\\Delta_{\\rm rq}/\\chi(0)|$. Note that in the two-level approximation (which we used in the simulations) ${\\bar n}/|\\Delta_{\\rm rq}/\\chi(0)|={\\bar n}/4n_{\\rm crit}$. In the simulations we have used $g/2\\pi=100\\,$MHz, $\\kappa_{\\rm r}^{-1}=36\\,$ns, $\\kappa_{\\rm f}^{-1}=0.71\\,$ns, $\\omega_{\\rm r}^{\\rm b}/2\\pi=\\omega_{\\rm f}/2\\pi=6.8\\,$GHz,\nand $\\omega_{\\rm q}^{\\rm b}/2\\pi=6\\,$GHz. The blue solid line shows the numerical suppression factor for the standard setup [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] (without the filter resonator), also in the two-level approximation for the qubit. We see a larger suppression for the case with the filter, as expected from\nthe ac Stark shift interpretation and the fact that $\\Gamma \\propto \\Delta_{\\rm rq}^{-4}$ with the filter, while $\\Gamma \\propto \\Delta_{\\rm rq}^{-2}$ in the standard setup.\nHowever, comparison with the prediction of the ac Stark shift model (dashed lines) does not show a quantitative agreement. There is about 10\n\nNote that the numerical calculations have been made using only the two-level model for the qubit. It is possible that the agreement between the ac Stark shift model and the numerical results is much better if three or more levels in the qubit are taken into account. This is an interesting question for further research.\n\nAlso note that in experiments, increase of the drive power often leads to decrease of the qubit lifetime, instead of the increase, predicted by our analysis (both with and without the filter). The reason for this effect is not quite clear and may be related to various technical issues. Therefore, either suppression or enhancement of the qubit relaxation with the drive power may be observed in actual experiments."}
{"prompt": "Explain the 'Decoding and weight extraction' section of the paper.", "completion": "To identify the most likely sequence of errors having occurred in a single instance of an experimental run, we decode the measured set of syndromes in post-processing by adopting the minimum-weight-perfect matching (MWPM) algorithm described in Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. We represent each syndrome element $\\sigma_{m}^{Ai}$ as a vertex of a graph, which has two spatial dimensions set by the layout of auxiliary qubits ${Ai}$ in the surface code lattice, and one temporal dimension indexed by the cycle number $m$. We connect pairs of vertices with edges, each of which represents a particular error at the physical level [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn our model, we consider three kinds of errors. First, auxiliary qubit errors, including errors during readout, which are represented by vertices at the same location but separated in time by one cycle ($\\Delta m =1$). Second, auxiliary qubit measurement misclassification errors, i.e. measurement errors which do not change the state of the auxiliary qubit, are represented by edges connecting vertices at the same location but separated in time by two cycles ($\\Delta m =2$). And third, single Pauli errors acting on data qubits, which are represented by edges connecting vertices either to a direct neighbor of the same type ($X$ or $Z$) or to a boundary. Depending on the time at which these errors occur, the corresponding edge either connects to a vertex of the same cycle ($\\Delta m =0$) or the next cycle ($\\Delta m =1$).   We extract the probabilities associated with those edges directly from measured syndrome correlations using the methods described in Refs.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Details of this scheme will be provided in a separate publication.\n\nBased on the individual edge error probabilities, we then compute for all pairs of vertices $k$ and $l$ with $\\Delta m \\leq 2$, the total probability $p_{{\\rm }kl}$ of being connected. We do so, by summing the individual probabilities over all possible error paths along the edges of the graph, see Ref.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] for details. Here, the terms  $p_{{\\rm }kk}$ correspond to the probability of having vertex $k$ being connected to a boundary.  We convert the matrix of probabilities ${p_{{}kl}}$ into a weight matrix $w_{kl} = -\\ln{p_{{}kl}}$, based on which the MWPM algorithm connects each syndrome element $\\sigma_{m}^{Ai}=1$ either to a second such syndrome element or to a boundary while minimizing the total weight associated with these connections.\n\nTo correct for decoded errors in the final outcome $z_{\\rm L}$ ($x_{\\rm L}$) of the logical operator $\\hat{Z}_{\\rm L}$ ($\\hat{X}_{\\rm L}$), we evaluate ${z}_{\\rm L}=z_1 z_2 z_3$ ($x_{\\rm L}=x_1 x_4 x_7$) from the final data qubit readout and multiply it by $(-1)^M$, where $M$ is the number of syndrome element pairs determined by the MPWM algorithm, which signal a logical error. A syndrome element pair signals a logical error if the underlying error path contains an odd number of errors on those data qubits, which are contained in the logical operator string $\\hat{Z}_{\\rm L} = \\hat{Z}_{1}\\hat{Z}_{2}\\hat{Z}_{3}$ ($\\hat{X}_{\\rm L} = \\hat{X}_{1}\\hat{X}_{4}\\hat{X}_{7}$).\n\nFor consistency we evaluate the weights for each of the experimental and simulated state preservation experiments independently. We verified that the decoding with weights extracted from separate data sets yields the same logical lifetimes."}

A spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) provides such a potential opportunity for quantum metrology with its wonderful controllability and fine-tuning in practical experiments\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, dephasing due to the stray magnetic fields in laboratories prevents the spinor BEC from wider applications and higher precisions, such as the quantum many-body ground state of an antiferromagnetic spin-1 BEC\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Suppressing the environmental noises such as the stray magnetic field becomes a long-standing challenge for quantum metrology and many-body quantum phase transition experiments utilizing spinor BECs\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nMany theoretical and experimental investigations have contributed to the suppressing of the stray magnetic fields. Some of these ideas are borrowed from the fields of nuclear magnetic resonance and quantum information and computation, such as the quantum error correction and dynamical decoupling with hard pulses\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For a spinor BEC system, there are also a few unique methods, such as the magnetic shield room, active compensation, and the spin Hahn echo pulse sequences\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. These methods suppressed the stray magnetic fields to a much lower value, e.g., $1$ nT in a recent work by Eto et al.\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. However, such a method is rather costly and the second order Zeeman effect of the strong driving field in the spin Hahn echo would prevent the method from perfect elimination of the noises\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn this paper, we propose to use the dynamical decoupling protocols, rotary echo (RE), with continuous driving pulses in stead of the hard ones in $\\delta$ shape (see Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:echo) for a comparison), to avoid the error accumulation with time\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\nSpecially, for a spinor BEC, the main noise source includes the local phase noise from stray magnetic fields and the radio frequency intensity noise\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The contribution of the magnetic-field gradient is usually negligible due to the advanced experimental controllability and the smallness of the condensate ($\\sim$10$\\mu$m). We apply the RE protocol in a spin-1 BEC, which is dephased by stray magnetic fields, and evaluate the performance of the RE protocol for two interesting condensate spin states, the coherent spin state and the squeezed spin state. We find that the RE protocol extends significantly the coherent time of the system if the continuous-pulse duration is close to its magic values, $\\tau = m\\pi/h$ ($m=1,2,3,\\cdots$) with $h$ the driving field strength. Our results point to a different direction to suppress the stray magnetic field effect in spinor BECs and to utilize the squeezed spin state in quantum metrology beyond the standard quantum limit\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we describe the spin-1 BEC system and the RE protocol, including the effect of the stray magnetic fields along $z$ axis and the driving field along $x$ axis. In Sec.\u00a0<ref>, we evaluate the performance of the RE protocol in preserving the spin average and the squeezing parameter for two interesting condensate spin states, the coherent spin state and the squeezed spin state. We give conclusions and discussions in Sec.\u00a0<ref>.\n\n## System description and rotary echo protocol\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color online.) Typical spin trajectories in (a) rotary echo and (b) Hahn echo. The initial spin state is marked by a yellow cross. (a) In a rotary echo, the spin rotates about the total field $h\\hat x + \\omega \\hat z$ during the first and the fourth quarter-cycle $\\tau$, in purple and blue solid lines, respectively; the spin rotates about the total field $-h\\hat x + \\omega \\hat z$ during the second and the third quarter-cycle, in red dashed lines. (b) In a Hahn echo, the spin evolves in a noise magnetic field $\\omega \\hat z$ for a cycle $4\\tau$. At the moments $\\tau$ and $3\\tau$, the spin is rotated for a $\\pi$ angle about $+x$ axis, denoted by red solid lines.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color online.) Pulse sequence of a RE. The RE is a symmetric sequence consisting of $N$ cycles. Within each cycle, the driving field direction is reversed between $+x$ and $-x$, denoted by $+h$ and $-h$, respectively. The two outer segments are along $+x$ for a duration time $\\tau$ and the inner segment along $-x$ for a duration time $2\\tau$. The period of a single cycle is $T=4\\tau$. After $N$ cycles, the total time is $t=4N\\tau$.\n\nWe consider a spin-1 condensate in a uniform magnetic field ${\\bf B}$ with the Hamiltonian described by [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]\n$$\n\\label{eq:ha}\n% \\nonumber % Remove numbering (before each equation)\n\\hat H &=& \\int\\mathrm{d}{\\bf r}\\left\\{\\hat\\psi_{i}^{\\dag}\\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2M}\\nabla^{2}+V_{ext}({\\bf r})+E_Z\\right]\\hat\\psi_{i} \\right.\\nonumber \\\\\n&& \\left.+ \\frac{c_{0}}{2}\\hat\\psi_{i}^{\\dag}\\hat\\psi_{j}^{\\dag}\\hat\\psi_{j}\\hat\\psi_{i}\n+\\frac{c_{2}}{2}\\hat\\psi_{k}^{\\dag}\\hat\\psi_{i}^{\\dag}(F_{\\gamma})_{ij}(F_{\\gamma})_{kl}\\hat\\psi_{j}\\hat\\psi_{l}\\right\\},\n\n$$\nwhere $i,j,k,l \\in \\{\\pm,0\\}$ with $\\pm,0$ denoting the magnetic quantum numbers $\\pm 1,0$, respectively. Repeated indices are summed. $\\hat \\psi_{i}(\\hat \\psi_{i}^{\\dag})$ is the field operator which annihilates (creates) an atom in the $i$th hyperfine state $|i\\rangle \\equiv |F=1,m_F=i\\rangle$. $M$ is the mass of the atom. Interaction terms with coefficients $c_{0}$ and  $c_{2}$ describe elastic collisions of spin-1 atoms, namely, $c_{0}=4\\pi \\hbar^{2}(a_{0}+2a_{2})/3M$ and $c_{2}=4\\pi \\hbar^{2}(a_{2}-a_{0})/3M$ with $a_{0}$ and $a_{2}$ being the $s$-wave scattering lengths in singlet and quintuplet channels. The spin exchange interaction is ferromagnetic (anti-ferromagnetic) if $c_{2}<0 $ ($>0$). $F_{\\gamma=x,y,z}$ are spin-1 matrices. $E_Z$ denotes the linear Zeeman shift of an alkali-metal atom,\n$E_Z = -g_F \\mu_B {\\bf B}\\cdot {\\bf F}$,\nwhere $g_{F}$ is the Land\u00e9 $g$-factor for an atom with the total angular momentum $F=1$, such as $^{87}$Rb and $^{23}$Na atoms, and $\\mu_{B}$ is the Bohr magneton.\n\nWe rewrite the Hamiltonian $\\hat H$ as the sum of symmetric part $\\hat H_s$ and the nonsymmetric part $\\hat H_a$, i.e., $\\hat H=\\hat H_s+\\hat H_a $, where\n$$\n\n\\hat H_s&=&\\int\\mathrm{d}{\\bf r}\\hat\\psi_{i}^{\\dag}\\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2M}\\nabla^{2}+V({\\bf r})\\right]\\hat\\psi_{i}+ \\frac{c_{0}}{2}\\hat\\psi_{i}^{\\dag}\\hat\\psi_{j}^{\\dag}\\hat\\psi_{j}\\hat\\psi_{i} \\nonumber \\\\\n\\hat H_a&=&\\int\\mathrm{d}{\\bf r}\\left[\\frac{c_{2}}{2}\\hat\\psi_{k}^{\\dag}\\hat\\psi_{i}^{\\dag}(F_{\\gamma})_{ij}(F_{\\gamma})_{kl}\\hat\\psi_{j}\\hat\\psi_{l} +\\hat\\psi_{i}^{\\dag}E_Z\\hat\\psi_{i}\\right]. \\nonumber\n\n$$\nFor $^{87}$Rb or $^{23}$Na condensates, the density-dependent interaction $c_0$ is much larger than the spin-dependent interaction $c_2$; thus $\\hat H_s$ is the dominate part.

The constant term $-2AN$ is omitted since the total atom number $N$ is conserved in experiments. Therefore, the Hamiltonian of the system becomes\n$$\n~\\label{eq:eff}\nH=AJ^2+{\\bf b}\\cdot {\\bf J}.\n\n$$\nFor a ferromagnetic spin-1 condensate, the SMA is valid in a wide range of magnetic fields\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. For such a ferromagnetic state, the total angular momentum $J$ equals to the total number of atoms $N$ at zero magnetic field. When the system is in a noisy environment, for example, in stray magnetic fields, the total magnetic field includes two sources: the applied external magnetic field and the stray magnetic field. In general, the external magnetic field is applied purposely and controlled accurately, but the stray magnetic field is noisy and needs to be suppressed since it usually causes the system to decohere in a short time.\n\nIn order to suppress the stray magnetic field and enhance the coherence of system, we employ the RE sequence as shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:echo)(a). Compared to the Hahn spin echo[Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:echo)(b)], the RE shows significant advantages: besides the prevention of the error cumulation after many pulses, the applied magnetic field is much smaller than that in a Hahn echo and the quadratic Zeeman effect can be safely neglected.\n\nFor a typical RE protocol, the direction of the applied magnetic field (or the phase of driving) is periodically reversed between $+x$ and $-x$. As shown in Fig\u00a0(Figure fig:rep), during each cycle, the driving field is along $+x$ for a duration of $\\tau$, then turned to $-x$ for a  duration of $2\\tau$, and turned back to $+x$ subsequently. The cycle period is $T=4\\tau$. The complete Hamiltonian during a RE cycle is described by\n$$\n\\label{eq:ham}\nH_{\\pm}=\\pm hJ_{x}+AJ^{2}+ w J_{z},\n\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the amplitude of the driving field, $\\pm$ indicate the direction of driving field. Here we have assumed the spin interaction is ferromagnetic $c_2<0$ and the minus sign before $H_{\\pm}$ has been omitted without loss of generality. Hence, we consider $h=\\mu_B g_F B_x, A$ and $w=\\mu_B g_F B_z$ positive hereafter, where $B_x$ ($B_z$) is the strength of the driving (stray) magnetic field.\n\n## Suppressing the stray magnetic field effect with rotary echo\nFor a single cycle RE, the time evolution operator is\n$$\n\\label{eq:evl}\nU=e^{-i\\tau H_{+}}e^{-2i\\tau H_{-}}e^{-i\\tau H_{+}}.\n\n$$\nFor a given $w$, the evolution of the system is essentially an $SO(3)$ rotation in spin space; thus the evolution operator can be written as $\\exp{(-i\\theta J_n)}$, where $J_n=\\bf J\\cdot\\bf n$ with $\\bf n$ being the rotation axis and $\\theta$ the rotation angle. From the Hamiltonian Eq. (<ref>), we find  $\\theta=\\tau\\sqrt{h^2+w^2}$ and $J_{n,\\pm}=\\pm n_xJ_x+n_zJ_z$, where $n_x= h/\\sqrt{h^2+w^2}$ and $n_z=w/\\sqrt{h^2+w^2}$. Since it contributes nothing to the rotation, the term $AJ^2$ in the Hamiltonian Eq. (<ref>) is neglected here and reconsidered as needed. It is easy to find the rotation matrix of the outer and the inner segment of the RE cycle (shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:rep)), respectively,\n$$\n\nR_+&=&\\left(\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\np_1 n_x^2+\\cos \\theta & -n_z \\sin\\theta & n_xn_z p_1  \\\\\nn_z\\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta & -n_x \\sin \\theta\\\\\nn_xn_z p_1  & n_x \\sin \\theta & p_1 n_z^2+\\cos \\theta \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right),\\nonumber\\\\\nR_{-}&=&\\left(\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\np_2 n_x^2+\\cos 2\\theta & -n_z \\sin 2\\theta & -n_xn_z p_2 \\\\\nn_z\\sin 2\\theta & \\cos 2\\theta & n_x \\sin 2\\theta \\\\\n-n_xn_z p_2   & -n_x \\sin 2\\theta & p_2 n_z^2+\\cos 2\\theta \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right),\\nonumber\n\n$$\nwhere $p_1 = 1-\\cos\\theta$ and $p_2 = 1-\\cos 2\\theta$. As a RE cycle we consider has a time-reversal symmetry, which cancels all the odd terms proportional to $J_y$ in the average Hamiltonian\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ], only the even terms with $J_x$ and $J_z$ are left. Therefore, the total rotation within the RE cycle is $\\tilde{U}=\\exp(-i\\alpha \\tilde J_n)$ with $\\tilde J_n=\\tilde n_xJ_x+\\tilde n_zJ_z$, and the rotation matrix becomes,\n$$\n\n\\tilde R =\\left(\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\nq_1 \\tilde n_x^2+\\cos \\alpha & -\\tilde n_z \\sin\\alpha & \\tilde n_x\\tilde n_z q_1 \\\\\n\\tilde n_z\\sin \\alpha & \\cos \\alpha & -\\tilde n_x \\sin \\alpha \\\\\n\\tilde n_x\\tilde n_z q_1 & \\tilde n_x \\sin \\alpha & q_1 \\tilde n_z^2+\\cos \\alpha \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\right)\n\n$$\nwith $q_1 = 1-\\cos \\alpha$. With the relationship $\\tilde R=R_+R_-R_+$, the rotation angle $\\alpha$ and the direction $\\tilde n_x$ and $\\tilde n_z$ are determined\n$$\n\n\\cos \\alpha &=& 1-n_z^4 (1-\\cos 4 \\theta)-4n_x^2n_z^2 (1-\\cos 2 \\theta)~\\label{eq:alpha}\\nonumber \\\\\n\\tilde n_x {\\sin\\alpha} &=& 8 n_xn_z^2 \\sin ^2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\sin \\theta \\left(n_z^2 \\cos 2\\theta +n_x^2\\right)\\nonumber \\\\\n\\tilde n_z^2 &=& 1-\\tilde n_x^2,\n\n$$\nwhere we have defined $\\cos\\beta=n_x$ and $\\sin\\beta=n_z$.\n\nThe single cycle evolution operator Eq.(\u00a0<ref>) eventually becomes a single exponential\n$$\n~\\label{eq:uni}\nU=\\exp[-i\\alpha(\\tilde n_xJ_x+\\tilde n_zJ_z)] \\exp(-i4\\tau AJ^2).\n\n$$\nIt is then straightforward to obtain the full $N$-cycle evolution operator\n$$\n~\\label{eq:uni2}\nU(t=4N\\tau)=\\exp[-i(\\lambda J_x+\\gamma J_z+4N\\tau A J^2)],\n\n$$\nwith $\\lambda=N\\alpha \\tilde n_x$ and $\\gamma=N\\alpha \\tilde n_z$.\n\nIn the analytical result Eq.\u00a0(<ref>), if $\\theta = m\\pi$ ($m=1,2,3,\\cdots$), $\\cos\\alpha=1$, thus $\\alpha=0$ and the evolution operator $U$ becomes unity, which indicates that the given magnetic field effect is exactly canceled by the RE sequence.\n\nHere we emphasize that the spin interaction term $AJ^2$ in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>) can not be excluded from the Hamiltonian of the BEC system, though it has no contribution to the results of our calculation. First, $AJ^2$ is a natural ingredient of the spinor BEC, which is often used to generate a special squeezed spin state, a twin-Fock state\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Second, we consider a ferromagnetic interaction $c_2<0$ so that a ferromagnetic coherent state (the ground state of the system) is stable and useful for a practical magnetometer. In addition, the RE driving field and the stray magnetic fields are small enough to omit their quadratic Zeeman effect; thus there is no necessity to consider the spin mixing dynamics of the driven spinor BEC\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nIn the following, we will numerically examine the performance of the RE sequence for two most interesting states: the coherent spin state (CSS) and the squeezed spin state (SSS). We will monitor the spin average for both states and the squeezing parameter for the SSS.\n\n### Coherent spin states\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color online.) Spin average evolution under REs for $\\tau=0.05$ (red diamonds), 0.1 (blue crosses), 0.12 (black squares), 0.14 (cyan hexagons), and 0.17 (green asterisks) with $h=20$. The blue circles are for $\\tau = \\pi/h$ with $h=20$. The FID is denoted with purple triangles. The solid lines, coinciding with the marks, are the corresponding analytical predictions by Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). The black dots(coinciding with the blue circles) are spin average under Hahn echoes as shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:echo)(b), where the cycle period is $4\\tau = 0.2\\pi$, the pulse amplitude is $10h=200$, and the pulse width is $0.005\\pi$. Other parameters are $A=0.02$ and $J=100$. The average is performed over $N_r = 10^3$ random $w$'s distributed uniformly between $[0,1]$.\nWhen $\\tau=\\pi/h$, the spin average barely decay under REs and Hahn echoes, indicating strong suppression of stray magnetic fields.\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color online) Dependence of the spin average on $t=4N\\tau$ and $h\\tau$. The parameters are $J=1$, $h=20$, and $A=0.02$. The spin average is conserved if $h\\tau=m\\pi \\; (m=1, 2, 3, \\cdots)$ as shown by horizontal dashed lines.\n\nWe consider an initial coherent spin state which is fully polarized along $y$ axis and evolves under the total Hamiltonian Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). We assume the stray magnetic-field effect as white noise, i.e., a series of random numbers ranging from 0 to $w_c$. We set the energy unit as $w_c=1$ and the corresponding time unit is $w_c^{-1}=1$. Other terms with $A$ and $h$ are all scaled with $w_c$. For a typical spin-1 BEC experiment, such as $^{87}$Rb, the stray magnetic fields are in the order of $1$ mG, i.e., roughly 3 kHz in energy. For a magnetic shield room with permalloy plates, the stray field can be further reduced down to $0.1$ mG\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nThe free evolution of the system, i.e., the free induction decay (FID), is often manifested by the decay of the transverse magnetization or the spin average\n$$\n~\\label{eq:sa}\n\\langle J_y\\rangle (t) &=& \\langle \\psi(t) | J_y |\\psi(t) \\rangle\n\n$$\nwhere $\\psi(t)$ is the wave function of the condensate spin at time $t$. In the stray magnetic fields, the condensate spin only precesses around $z$ axis and is dephased with a characteristic time $T^*_2$. It is easy to find the FID signal\n$$\n~\\label{eq:sa}\n\\langle J_y\\rangle (t) &=& J\\;\\frac {\\sin(w_c t)} {w_c t} \\nonumber\n\n$$\nand the dephasing time is in the order of $T_2^* \\sim w_c^{-1}$, as also shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:expv).\n\nBy including the driving field $h$, the dephasing due to the stray magnetic field is suppressed by the REs, i.e., the spin average is larger than the FID signal. It is straightforward to calculate the spin average for a given $w$ at $t=4N\\tau$\n$$\n\n\\langle J_y\\rangle(t)=J\\cos{(\\sqrt{\\lambda^2+\\gamma^2}\\,)}, \\nonumber\n\n$$\nwhere we have adopted the $N$-cycle evolution operator in Eq.\u00a0(<ref>). For a distribution of many $w$'s, we find\n$$\n~\\label{eq:fin}\n\\langle J_y\\rangle(t)=\\frac J {N_r} \\sum_{i=1}^{N_r} \\cos{(\\sqrt{\\lambda_i^2+\\gamma_i^2}\\,)}\n\n$$\nwith $N_r$ being the number of random samples. Since each stray magnetic field frequency $w_i$ is untrackable, we consider the strong driving regime, $h\\gg w_c$, which is often the case in a practical precision measurement experiment. Hence, when $h\\tau=m\\pi$, $\\langle J_y(t)\\rangle$ barely decay.\n\nTo check the validity regime for $h\\gg w_c$, we carry out numerical calculations and present both analytical and numerical results in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:expv). For the parameters we choose ($g \\lesssim 0.05$, where $g=w_c/h$), the analytical and numerical results agree well. As shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:expv), the RE sequence always suppresses the stray magnetic-field effect and improves the spin average, no matter what value of $\\tau$ is. As $\\tau$ increases from a small value, the performance of the RE protocol becomes better, i.e., the spin average at a fixed time becomes larger. In particular, the spin average is almost a constant if the magic condition $\\tau = \\pi /h $ is satisfied [see also Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:echo)(a)]. We remark that such a magic $\\tau$ exists simultaneously for all $w_i$, instead of a single one. Once $\\tau > \\pi/h$, the spin average drops with $\\tau$ increasing. In addition, our numerical results for $J=10$ and $J=100$ agree exactly, indicating that the performance of the RE protocol is independent of the spin size $J$. Finally, we compare the evolution of spin average under the magic REs and Hahn echoes with the same cycle period $4\\tau = 0.2\\pi$. The pulse amplitude and width of the Hahn echoes are, respectively, $10h=200$ and $0.1\\tau=0.005\\pi$. The performance of the magic RE protocol is essentially the same as that of the Hahn echo.\n\nTo investigate the effect of various $\\tau$, we further calculate the spin average under RE sequences for different $\\tau$s and present the results in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:ttau). We see clear periodicity of $\\tau = m\\pi/h$ where the spin average is almost conserved, from Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:ttau). In addition, the good performance region, where the spin average is close to $J$ (red region in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:ttau)), becomes larger as $m$ increases.\n\n### Squeezed spin states\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color online.) Time evolution of (a) the spin average and (b) the $z$-axis spin squeezing parameter for $J=10^3$. The initial direction of the spin is along $y$ axis and the initial optimal squeezing direction is along $z$ axis. The parameters are $h=2, \\tau=0.1$ (blue crosses), $h=2, \\tau=0.5$ (black asterisks), $h=2, \\tau=\\pi/h$ (cyan diamonds), $h=20, \\tau=0.1$ (red squares),  and $h=20, \\tau=\\pi/h$ (blue circles). The FID is denoted with purple triangles. The black dots in (a) and (b) are the evolutions under the Hahn echoes with the cycle period of $4\\tau = 0.2\\pi$, the pulse amplitude of $10h = 200$, and the pulse width of $0.005\\pi$. Other parameter is $A=0.02$. In (b), the black solid line (coinciding with the purple triangles) denotes the optimal squeezing parameter $\\xi_s^2$ sought with numerical method. The spin average and the squeezing parameter are simultaneously fixed by the RE with $h\\gg 1$ and $\\tau = m\\pi/h$. However, the Hahn echoes fail to fix the squeezing parameter.\n\nWe next consider the most interesting spin state, the SSS, which is widely used in precision measurement and quantum metrology. For such a spin state, besides its spin average $\\langle J_y\\rangle(t)$, we are also interested in the spin-squeezing parameter $\\xi_{s}^2$, which represents the optimal or most squeezed transverse spin fluctuation\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ],\n$$\n\\label{eq:xis}\n\\xi^2_s=\\frac{2\\min(\\Delta J^2_{n_{\\perp}})}{J},\n\n$$\nwhere $n_\\perp$ denotes a transversal direction perpendicular to the spin average direction and the minimization (numerically) runs over all the transversal  directions. The squeezing parameter $\\xi_s^2 = 1$ for a CSS and $\\xi_s^2 < 1$ for a SSS.\n\nA SSS can be generated by a one-axis or two-axis twisting Hamiltonian from an initial CSS with polarization along $y$ axis\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. In this paper, we adopt the two-axis twisting method in which the optimal squeezing direction is invariant during the evolution\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. The nonlinear two-axis twisting Hamiltonian is $H_{TAT}=\\chi (J_xJ_z+J_zJ_x)$. The SSS is generated with spin average along $y$ axis, optimal squeezing direction along $z$ axis, and $\\xi_s = 0.0009$ at $t = 0.002/\\chi$ for $J = 10^3$.\n\nAfter the preparation of the SSS, the $H_{TAT}$ is turned off. The spin state should be preserved without the stray magnetic fields. However, the SSS evolves by taking into account the stray magnetic fields. As shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:sss), the spin average drops rapidly in the time scale of $w_c^{-1}$, but the spin squeezing parameter $\\xi_s^2$ is not changed, nor is the optimal squeezing axis which is the same as the initial one.\n\nBy applying the driving field $h$ along $\\pm x$ axis, both the spin average and the optimal squeezing axis are in general varying with time, but the optimal squeezing parameter $\\xi_s^2$ is always unchanged, as shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:sss). To better evaluate the performance of the RE protocol, we introduce the $z$-axis spin squeezing parameter\n$$\n\\label{eq:xis}\n\\xi^2=\\frac{2\\Delta J^2_z}{J}.\n\n$$\nFor a perfect RE protocol, the initial SSS is preserved; thus both the spin average $\\langle J_y\\rangle$ and the $z$-axis spin squeezing parameter $\\xi^2$ should be fixed.\n\nWe numerically simulate the time evolution of the condensate spin with the total Hamiltonian Eq. (<ref>), starting from an initial SSS. The spin average, the $z$-axis spin squeezing parameter $\\xi^2$, and the optimal spin squeezing parameter $\\xi_s^2$ are presented in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:sss). The weak driving $h=2$ ($g\\lesssim 0.5$) case and the strong driving $h=20$ ($g\\lesssim 0.05$) case are both included.\n\nIn the cases of weak driving, the spin average increases with $\\tau$ increasing at a fixed time, indicating that the RE protocol works for preserving the spin average. However, the spin average still drops significantly in an intermediate time even at the magic condition $\\tau = \\pi/h$.\nFurthermore, the squeezing parameter $\\xi^2$ increases to pretty large values for all the weak driving cases. The larger the $\\tau$ is, the bigger the squeezing parameter $\\xi^2$ is. Therefore, the weak driving RE protocol is not good at preserving the SSS and suppressing the stray magnetic-field effect.\n\nIn the cases of strong driving, the spin average at a fixed time becomes larger with a bigger $\\tau$. Particularly, the spin average is almost a constant at the magic condition $\\tau = \\pi/h$. More remarkably, the squeezing parameter $\\xi^2$ increases only slightly at times much longer than the dephasing time $T_2^* \\sim w_c^{-1}$. Our numerical results confirm that the RE protocol with strong driving preserves not only the spin average but also the spin squeezing, including the amplitude and the direction. However, as a comparison, the Hahn echo protocol only preserves the spin average rather than the spin squeezing parameter. Therefore, the stray magnetic-field effect can be significantly suppressed by the RE protocol at magic condition $\\tau = m\\pi /h$ with $h\\gg w_c$.\n\n## Conclusion\nWe investigate with analytical and numerical methods the performance of the rotary echo protocol in suppressing the effects of the stray magnetic fields. Our results show that the RE protocol with strong driving field $h$ at magic condition $\\tau = m\\pi /h$ well preserves the spin average for a coherent spin state of a spin-1 Bose condensate. Moreover, for a squeezed spin state, the same magic RE protocol simultaneously preserves not only the spin average but also the spin squeezing, including the amplitude and direction. Such a consequence of the RE protocol on spin squeezing has not been well appreciated in previous investigations in nuclear magnetic resonance community. The effects of the stray magnetic fields are significantly suppressed by the magic RE protocol. To implement the RE protocol in spin-1 BEC experiments, the applied driving field can be as small as $\\sim 1$ mG for a magnetic shield room and $\\sim 10$ mG for an ordinary laboratory, much smaller than the field applied in standard Hahn spin echo experiments ($\\sim 100$ mG)\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ]. Our results provide a practical method to control the\nstray magnetic-field effect in spinor BEC experiments and may find wide applications in precision measurement and quantum metrology, quantum phase transition, and ground-state properties in spinor Bose condensates\u00a0[Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ] [Unknown Author, \"Unknown Title\", ].\n\nW.Z. thanks V.

The $1/f$ noise is numerically distributed in the range $[4\\times10^{-5}, 1]w_c$, while the Gaussian noise is in $[0,w_c]$ with an average of $0.5w_c$ and a full width at half maximum $0.1w_c$. The distributions of the noises are normalized and contain $1000$ samples in our calculation. Other parameters are the same as Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:sss).\n\n< g r a p h i c s >\n\n(Color online.) Time evolution of (a) the spin average\nand (b) the z-axis spin squeezing parameter in the presence of $1/f$ noise (purple crosses), Gaussian noise (black diamonds), and white noise (blue circles). Other parameters are the same as in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:sss). The suppression of the $1/f$ and the Gaussian noise is more efficient than that of the white noise.\n\nThe comparisons are shown in Fig.\u00a0(Figure fig:cn). Clearly, the RE protocol also suppresses the colored noises and the performances of the RE protocol in the colored noises are actually better than in the white noise, i.e., the spin averages are higher and the spin squeezing parameters are lower.\n\n49\nnatexlab#1#1bibnamefont#1#1bibfnamefont#1#1citenamefont#1#1url<#>1urlprefixURL\n\n[Giovannetti et\u00a0al.(2011)Giovannetti,\nLloyd, and Maccone]Giovannetti2011Advances\nauthorV.\u00a0Giovannetti,\nauthorS.\u00a0Lloyd, and\nauthorL.\u00a0Maccone,\njournalNature Photon. volume5,\npages222 (year2011).\n\n[Muessel et\u00a0al.(2014)Muessel, Strobel,\nLinnemann, Hume, and Oberthaler]Muessel14PRL\nauthorW.\u00a0Muessel,\nauthorH.\u00a0Strobel,\nauthorD.\u00a0Linnemann,\nauthorD.\u00a0B.
